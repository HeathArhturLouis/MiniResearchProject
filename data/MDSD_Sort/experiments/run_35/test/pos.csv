 Bellow's first two novels are apprentice works. In this work he gives signs of the voice to come but has not yet freed himself completely into a voice of his own. Nonetheless the work is an interesting one, a kind of ' double ' of a Dostoevsky work ' on the double theme'. It is also a book about how one can pettily sustain one's own hope by resenting others. An Anglo- Saxon holder of the keys to the kingdom resents the Jewish intruder about to come on to his intellectual turf. This novel echoes Bellow's own experience in being thrust away as an undergraduate from the English Department at Northwestern. The work has flashes of the kind of social criticism and general historical and cultural reflections  Bellow would  refine to a high art in later works, primarily 'Herzog'. This is not in the first rank of Bellow's books but because it is Bellow it is still an intelligent, probing and stimulating read.  
 This book was great. Once again Chunichi threw down. Excellent read. I read this book in 4 hours Make sure to read Married to the game the female was scandalous 
 Like many other hostage tales, there are moments of true human interaction between the hostage and her captors in this book.  Interestingly enough, but not surprisingly, some of these moments occur during various soccer matches that are watched by the kidnappers.  Although Sgrena is anything but a sports fan, her Italian nationality gives her credence if only because of one of the kidnappers obsession with Italian soccer. She describes her discussions of religion and non-belief with the mujaheedin holding her and their difficulty in understanding her relationship to her unmarried longtime partner. Unlike other hostage tales, especially the recent story  by US journalist taken hostage Jill Carroll, Sgrena refuses to accept the rationale of the occupiers and insists thgoughout the text that it is the occupation that is the primary culprit in Iraq, not the resistance.  The descriptions of the aforementioned conversations reminds the reader of the contradictory nature of the human condition--warriors able to hold a woman prisoner yet curious enought of this person from another culture to converse with her and debate, even though their commanders and clerics might not approve.  As regards Sgrena's thoughts on Iraq, it is her contention that the fighters against the occupiers are primarily composed of two elements: the nationalist insurgency and the jihadists.  Sgrena states that the jihadists want the US in Iraq because it gives them a front in their war on the infidels, while the insurgency wants the US and other occupation troops out so they can get on with their lives.  As I write this review, the news broadcasts are reporting on a demonstration of hundreds of thousands against the US occupation of Iraq and the Israeli war on Lebanon in Baghdad.  The primary component of this demonstration were Shia Iraqis that support Muqtada al-Sadr.  According to the news report, US officials claim to be concerned that this massive show of strength by these Shia Iraqis could provoke attacks on them by members of the Sunni community in Iraq.   While there may be some truth to this possibility, the fact that the US command is expressing concern is so transparent as to be laughable.  After all, the US military and intelligence have certainly killed more of Sadr's supporters than their fellow Iraqis have.  It is more likely that the US is concerned that the solidarity being expressed across religious lines and across the Arab world for the resistance of Hezbollah to Israel's onslaught will become the dominant current in Iraq.  If that occurred, the resistance to the occupation would be nearly universal among Iraqis.  That would spell the end of not only the occupation, but of the jihadists as well. Of course, the Pentagon and White House (with approval from Congress) remains convinced that the situation can be remedied in favor of Washington via military means.  Indeed, the commander of US Central Command, General Abizaid, went on record in early August stating that he could "imagine" the US military "winning" Baghdad.  As Sgrena's book clarifies (once again), this imaginary scenario is nothing more than a pipe dream for the US generals and a nightmare for the Iraqis.  As the occupation and its consequent mayhem continue no one is certain what the next phase will look like. The civil strife between various religious trends is but one facet of the aforementioned mayhem.  Underlying it all is the continuing dismal state of most Iraqis' economic lives and the lack of any apparent future of peace. Sgrena's understanding of this desperate situation and Washington's fundamental role in creating and maintaining it are the subject of much of her commentary in the book.  It is interspersed with a narrative describing the physical realities of her captivity  and her means of dealing with the boredom, fear, and hopelessness that are part of any imprisonment.  Her journalistic abilities are quite apparent in these descriptions--one feels that they know the characteristics of the room she spent her captivity almost as well if they had seen a walk-through video of it.  Her discussion of the emotions she experienced are interwoven into her story  in such a way that they become like the darkness of her mask that the kidnappers insist she wear at times of their choosing.  Or the daylight that we assume will always be.  They exist but they do not overwhelm.  In fact, that is how Sgrena tells her story.  Perhaps it is her journalistic detachment or perhaps it is the only manner in which she could write it down.  No matter what the reason may be, it works.  Friendly Fire is more than the tale of one hostage's ordeal and it is more than just another tract on the US-created debacle that is Iraq.  It is not a cry for revenge, but a tempered statement on a nation's shattered psyche and an individual attempt to share a perspective influenced by her unforeseen role in that nation's history 
 NOTE: The review which follows is of the revised and updated (i.e. most recently published) edition co-authored by Robert B. Miller and Stephen E. Heiman with Tad Tuleja.  With Tuleja, Miller and Heiman offer a revised and updated edition of a book first published 20 years ago. Why? "The first [reason] is that our clients asked us to. Even though they found strategic Selling to be just as effective, and the concepts just as relevant, as they had been in 1985, some of them felt that...even the best processes could use a face-lift....The second reason we revised Strategic Selling [i.e. the book] relates to a basic axiom of the process itself: `Whatever got you where you are today is no longer sufficient to keep you there." And even if it did, I presume to add, it is almost certainly not sufficient to get you where you want to go.   Miller, Heiman, and their associates examined the original and subsequently revised material (1998) with "a fine-tooth comb, sharpening and enhancing it line-by-line." The results of those labors are impressive, especially given the new discussions of various strategy concepts such as Degree of Influence (also known as Circle of Influence); the Win-Win Statement (rigorously examined in Chapter 10); Competition (covered in an entirely new chapter in Part 2, Chapter 13; and The "Refined Sales Funnel," a time and territory management tool which is most effective when carefully coordinated with another tool, the Ideal Customer Profile. In this edition, Miller and Heiman reverse the order: "Focusing on Your Ideal Customer "(Part 4, Chapters 14 and 15) followed by "Managing Your Selling Time" (Part 5, Chapters 16-18).   Of special interest to me is the final section, "After Twenty Years: Responding to Our Clients' Most Challenging Questions," to which Miller and Heiman respond. 15. Yes, the questions are indeed "challenging" -- questions which everyone at least directly involved in sales should be asking of themselves on a regular basis -- but the greater value of this section is derived from what Miller and Heiman have so say. Their comments are directly responsive, offered with a conversational (as opposed to a professorial) tone. When appropriate, they duly acknowledge the complexities and ambiguities in a given situation. And throughout their responses, they make a sincere and generally effective effort to "level" with their reader. For example:  14. "The Surefire Close. When all is said and done, you still have to close. Do you have any reliable closing techniques for helping us to improve our hit ratio?"  A: "In a word: No." Why? See the complete response on pages 422-423.   15. "The Secret of Success. We're often told that the salesperson's single most important quality is persistence. What do you think about this?"  A: "Persistence is an admirable quality, but it won't get you anywhere unless the people you are persistent with believe in you and are absolutely convinced that they can trust you....The one quality that every great salesperson has got to have is not persistence but credibility." Why? See the complete response on pages 423-424.  Granted, these brief examples are taken out of context, in terms both of the section from which they are excerpted and the book within which that section serves as a conclusion. Nonetheless, I hope they give at least some indication of why a revised and updated edition was needed.  Everyone in sales should have her or his own "toolkit." Some of its contents are provided by the given employee, others are provided by formal training and/or a supervisor, and still others from a book such as this. Long ago, I realized that strategies are "hammers" and tactics are "nails." The former drive the latter. That said, I presume to offer a caveat. Keep in mind this bromide: a camel is a horse designed by a committee. Obviously, it would be foolish to stuff a "toolkit" with everything offered by Miller and Heiman in combination with everything offered in other excellent books such as Neil Rackham's SPIN Selling, Jacques Werth and Nicholas E. Ruben's High Probability Selling, and Gary Hankins' The Power of the Pitch. Presumably Miller and Heiman agree that readers of books such as theirs must be aware of everything available in what could be called "The Salesperson's Super Hardware Store." The challenge is to select and then use effectively those tools which are most appropriate to the given marketplace.      
 Descartes' contribution to philosophy is undeniable, as well as his place in the history of science and mathematics.  Descartes' thinking absolutely changed my life.  His skeptical approach and decision to look inward and  determine the existence of the self before concerning himself with the rest  of the world (and God) was essential to his philosophical system, and  influenced me more than any other person's thinking.  And it's all laid out  in this book.  Buy it, read it, and let it change your life forever 
 As dark and depressing as the first few chapters were, it was amazing to see the light at the end of the tunnel by the time I finished this book. It is about family. It is about fractured lives and how one incident changes a family's life forever. It is about love and unredeemed love. It is about selfishness and unselfishness. It is about life in today's world. It is about mental illness and coping. It is about a family. It is about how nothing is how it seems.  This book is about Rachel Jensen, who has it all: a husband who adores her, a new baby boy and a teenage daughter. She lives in a beautiful house that she and Ned built when she was pregnant with their daughter. Life was almost perfect and she was very content. Till her daughter came home from summer camp. Till something happened to her baby son, and her daughter gets sent away. Lying in bed all hours of the day, Rachel tries to avoid the nastiness that has become her life. Ned's gone and working in a job that he hates since he got fired from his prestigious job as a teacher in a private school. Her daughter's gone, sent up to an institute for troubled girls. Her little boy's too young to understand what's going on. Rachel went from having it all to having nothing.  Sounds depressing, doesn't it? Don't give up on this book. It really is a beautifully written novel on how sometimes in the midst of the deepest despair, life continues to give you strength to move on; that eventually, it will all get better. Yes, you will continue on as a fractured family, but perhaps the Jensens will continue to build on the fractures and make themselves stronger for it. It is a moving thought as well as a moving tribute to today's society and its pressures on families. It is a well-written book, thoughtful and provoking.   1-14-0 
 This is a wonderful book for artist and non artist alike.  You do not need to have experience with meditation to follow the guidelines in this book.  It has been a delightful experience to follow the exercises here.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to enjoy a thoughtful art making experience. 
 Although lengthy enough to use as a satisfactory doorstop, it was worth the reading.  Not only a biography of Da Vinci's life, the author traces the evolution (sometimes convolutions)of his thought processes, as well as the social background of his more famous artistic works. Nicholl's inclusion of information on the subsequent history and restorations of paintings helped to anchor it in the present. While Fruedian interpretations are always murky at best (as oft pointed out:  sometimes a cigar is just a cigar) their inclusion was also entertaining.  Highly recommended - an excellent launching into the 1400's 
 This book is about Tree, a twelve year old boy who is way too tall, parents are divorced, his Grandfathers leg was cut off and is getting a fake one,2 older bro's in Ivy leauge schools. A mom who wants to talk to her kids via IM. Tree is not athletic, but is on the basketball team. With Grandpa's leg cut off after Vietnam, he is finally getting a new leg, but all is not going well, the boys are home for summer break and after a fight, a brother is drunk.

Dad is at the store, the boys are with friends, and Bradly Cannot go to the shelter when all 4 arrive. After the rain stopped, well you'll see. I give this book 5 stars because it warms the coldest heart with the hardest and simplest struggles.This is a favorite book of mine, I voted this book for the Rebecca Caudill award. When you read Stand tall, you'll under stand why 
 If you enjoy seeing good, but fundamentally human and weak, characters involve themselves in rather funny, socially embarrassing positions, this is a great novel for you.  I'm too feminist to rate this novel a five-Trollope's accurate portrayal of the vulnerable position of women in Victorian society unsettled me.  There is no powerful, outrageous woman figure like Mrs. Proudie of "Barchester Towers"-Mrs. Proudie does get a one-line mention in the novel, however!  There are some wonderful minor characters here-Archie, Sophie, and Boodles are wickedly fun.  If you are a Trollope addict not yet familiar with this novel, I'd say this is a sort of happy "Small House at Allington."  If you are familiar with Rousseau, you will recognize the main character Julie is Trollope's variation on "Julie ou La Nouvelle Heloise" sans the premarital or adulterous sex.  If all this is mumbo-jumbo to you, the book is a wonderful depiction of Victorian life featuring a love triangle 
 I first discovered Ofra Haza as a kid while rummaging through my mom's extensive cd collection on a rainy day.  I saw "Shaday" and the beautiful, mystical-looking cover and decided to play it and see what it was all about.  Boy, am I glad! Before the first song, Im Nin Alu, was even over, I was captivated.  I listened to the cd over and over and over again, enraptured by Ofra's haunting vocals.  Her voice is pure beyond belief, full of passion, and goes soaring into great heights with a beautiful trill.  Her charming Israeli accent creates a sense of ethnicity and beautiful foreigness. I am a fan of 80's music, I admit, but Shaday, and all of Ofra's albums, stand out from the pack.  Her magnificent voice, which can be compared to none other, combined with Middle-Eastern intruments, tunes, and flair, in addition to the dance beats (such as on Im Nin Alu and Galbi) create a unique sound that has aged well.  I have looked, and to my dismay, have found no other artist that sounds quite like Ofra Haza.  Even though she is no longer with us, her music, spirituality, and stance for peace will carry on 
 Dont forget that Dr. Geisler and Josh Mcdowell have never lost a debate. It's easy to "try" to refute the authors when they cant hear you....Go ahead organize a debate with them, if none of the so called "top athiests" cant debunk them what makes you think you can. Oh yeah, dont bother trying to debate me go ahead and contact the authors.  Outstanding book couldnt put it down 
 In The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Anne Bronte proves herself to be just as capable a writer as her more famous sisters.  This novel is about the suffering of one woman living in an unhappy marriage, and Bronte uses that story to display the desperation of women of that time trapped in inequal relationships.  She also manages to show the strength and cleverness with which women managed to make use of what little power they had.  The characters are well-developed and come alive in every scene, and the dialogue of the novel is very powerful.    At the end, however, the story peters out; though the framing of the novel through a series of letters works well for most of the book, the last few chapters are weak, as Bronte tries too hard to create a firm end for every minor character she introduced throughout the book, and it doesn't quite fit with the narrative.  But besides those few pages, this book is solidly written and clearly conceived.  I strongly recommend it for anyone desiring a somewhat more realistic view of the period than presented by either of her sister's novels, but with just as great of writing 
 I've had a couple of these divided containers for 3-4 years now. Unlike some Tupperware products, you can't just throw this in a tote bag and expect it to not leak at all if it goes somewhat vertical. BUT, that said, for the price, it's great. Love the fact that it's entirely see-through. Perfect for taking leftovers for lunch to work. 
 This is a companion to the book 'Prayer of Jabez' by Bruce Wilkinson. Her Bruce discusses in greater detail the steps to take in making Jabez's petition to God a part of daily life. He has also included readers' accounts of the ways their lives have been enriched by prayer in the unabridged Library of Congress tapes. A very inspirational read 
 Wow! what a great book. I realized that my ADD problems really surfaced when I stopped playing and had no oultlet for my creativity.I reccommend this book to both ADDults and parents of ADD children. It will help you to  understand yourself or your child a lot better 
 Everyone's got one's share of distressing moments, failing to use some variations of widely utilized hardware like doors, windows, entertainment systems, faucets etc. I know I've got quite a lot of them. I used to think it was because I am slightly dyslexic.  Thanks to Mr.Norman's well articulated insight into knowledge in the head, knowledge in the world, affordances etc., reviewing those moments --not a difficult job, by the way, as mr. brain has a funny way with embarrassing moments: it may store your PIN to your cash card so deep, that it takes a minute to dig it up, but it keeps the memories of those embarrasing moments virtually on the surface so when you wake up in the middle of the night mr. brain can immediately fish out one of them; Dave Barry is quite right with his theory that this could account for a large percentage of inexplicable midnight suicides-- I now know I was buffled because the design was misleading or plain bad.  The infrequent hitches with the book are a small number of sections where Mr.Norman over-articulates. He certainly does not bore: the content is quite stimulating throughout the book. It's just that some of his ideas could be expressed with less words and/or less repetitions than they are.  His most striking ideas are expressed simply (one could argue that they are striking *because* they are expressed simply). I personally love his observation on users' manuals for doors: even a single word (PUSH or PULL) users' manual is a sign that the door was badly designed 
 After riding the whirlwind of On The Road and Howl, many readers will acquire an appetite for Beat literature that will lead them to this book. Ann Charters serves up some of the best pieces of Beat Literature in this anthology. However, some inclusions, such as excerpts from On The Road, could be considered sacrilege, as the texts were never meant to be cut up, and suffer as a result. The Bob Dylan lyrics included by Charters indicate that she was no Dylan scholar, as other tracks would have been more suitable. However, with inclusions such as Neal Cassady's letters, William S. Burroughs adventure narratives, and the lesser known Beat poetry, this anthology is indispensable 
 Men's Health is one of the most popular men's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man. You simply have to know about fitness, dieting, supplements, fashion, gadgets, etc. The annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks. One of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities. The tips are definitely useful and yet I highly recommend in addition the bestseller "scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" for the latest secrets in this area. Another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy, lean and fit. There are weight loss tips, advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast. This is important part of keeping sharp appearance. Overall, I can reasonably say that you will learn a lot, have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover 
  I was thrilled when this cookbook was first released.  I grew up with fantastic Korean cooking all my life, and was looking forward to having recipes written down that I could refer to when cooking mainly from memory.  After having owned the book for several years, I now realize that is exactly how I use the cookbook -- as a reference and reminder on how to do things.  But I almost never follow a recipe to the letter.  That may be because I am used to doing things the way my mother did, which may vary slightly from Hepinstall's method.  But more often, I think it is because Hepinstall seems to add on extra steps to recipes which should be less complicated.  When I read her recipes, I'm often inspired by the idea of the dish, but put-off by the numerous steps it would take to get to the final result.  For those of you who are looking for quick yet tasty home-cooked Korean meals, I would suggest looking up "Flavors of Korea" by Coultup (sp?).  The recipes are vegetarian, but I think even meat-eaters would enjoy the wonderfully spiced dishes.    If you love Korean cooking, and want to kick your home-cooking techniques up a notch, by all means invest in Hepinstall's volume.  It is a valuable record of a style of Korean cooking that is rarely being practiced these days in Seoul.  I especially loved the sections on making your own soy sauce and daenjang.  I won't ever actually make my own soy sauce probably, but I like having a record of how it was done, just for posterity's sake 
 Maya Angelou pours her heart and soul into the pages of I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings.  She opens a window into her life that leaves the reader feeling voyeuristic and inspired at that same time.  Spanning her life from her childhood in Stamps, Arkansas to the birth of her son when she's sixteen I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings leaves the reader anxious for the next book of Ms. Angelou's life.  You can feel the dirt on your feet, smell Sunday dinner, and feel the silence of Angelou's self imposed muteness.  Maya Angelou has a way with words captures the reader's imagination 
 Ah - from a golden time in music when we had such an abundance of awesomely talented r&b groups, bands & solo artists. Groups like Brownstone, En Vogue & Xscape defined what a true female group should sound like.   I was impressed by the number of tracks that Nichole Gilbert (arguably the best vocalist of the group) wrote/co-wrote and how much of the production she was involved in on this disc.  Listening to it again makes me sad about the state of r&b music today but grateful for the time when true artists were allowed to shine.  My favorite tracks are: GRAPEVYNE, IF YOU LOVE ME   I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY (love this song with its excellent arrangements & their tight harmonies)   SOMETIMES DANCIN' (interesting musical production - especially the reagge breakdown & while the lead vocals are great, the backing is kind of boring until they hit the reagge break)  DON'T CRY FOR ME (their individual vocals & group harmonies are beautiful, this song sounds almost like a contemporary inspirational/gospel song)  DEEPER FEELINGS (really pretty slow ballad where they trade lead vocals with tight harmonies a la En Vogue)  HALF OF YOU (pretty balld with Nichole singing lead accompanied by just a piano)  If you're starved for some great r&b and are curious about another female group that came out during the En Vogue/Destiny's Child/TLC era, give Brownstone a try, you won't be disappointed 
 Mr. Capra is an excellent, pro-American director.  He believes in the USA.....his movies prove it.  In today's world it is nice to watch movies that have strong Christian, moral pro-USA values.  I have liked every Capra movie I have ever seen.  He was cutting edge as a movie director.  
 Brian's Song was the greatest football movie ever made.  It showed the respect between 2 players (and really the rest of the teams).  It showed that men can be friends and still cry 
 Of the thousands (literally) of cds that I own, I can honestly say that this one has had the greatest psychological effect on me.  I feel kinda bad about saying that since from my own understanding, it's the album that Richie Hawtin spent the least amount of time on.  It was recorded under pressure shortly after he was let back into the US after being deported.  I think the events in his personal life are seriously reflected in the music.  It's VERY dark, seductive music that will put you in an altered state.  I highly recommend picking up this album, turning down the lights, and preparing yourself for a mind-expanding experience 
 The Prada perfume was authentic and the packaging was genuine. The only problem is the picture shown on the website was not what I received.  I expected to receive the bottle with the atomizer, but it was not.  There was no way to know this from the picture or the description provided.  I highly recommend the perfume good value and smells divine. 
 Stephen King steps off into the woods and gives us Trisha McFarland. She's out for a day of hiking with her mom and brother (who don't get along) when after a quick step off the trail, she becomes lost in the wilderness. This book does not have the same supernatural theme that King normally uses, but this story is uneasy nonetheless. Getting lost in the wilderness is much more real than vampires and werewolves, and King does an excellent job giving us real insight into Trisha's thoughts. This book is one of my favorite Stephen King books. 
 Simon, Cath, Josh, and Portia were college friends and roommates in England. They thought that they would remain friends for a long time. Then Portia did something that changed their relationship. Si, Cath, and Josh are all still friends and see each other all the time. Cath and Si are so close that if he were not gay they would have married long ago.  Then Si, Cath, Josh and his wife Lucy find out that Portia is the writer for a very popular T.V. show whose characters are replicas of themselves so they get back in touch with Portia.  Lucy and Cath get involved in opening a bookstore together and with the help of James whom becomes Cath's boyfriend they are the hit of the town. Unfortunately Si finds himself in the worst crisis of his life. He was involved with aragent Will who after they break up tells Si that he just found out he's H.I.V. Positive and they had not used any protection.  This is a great book, showing the ups and downs of friends and how when the chips are down friends will always be there for you 
 This was a great book, full of samples of different kinds of writing, and good advice on, as they say, just about everything. From babysitting to eating disorders, from the enviroment to depression, this is a wonderful  can't-put-down book 
 I had seen this movie back in the 70's and had a difficult time finding it. The movie is very good. The product is very good for the price. Highly recommend this movie for any overweight person. It is funny! Talk about SWEET REVENGE!  Ha 
 you will find a picture of me!!!! That's right Mr. Glenn I am now a boni-fide fan of yours... I once thought Roy Glenn was just another street writer (not that there's anything wrong with that) but oh... he is so much more.... the suspense, the intrique... the mystery ...the satisfaction  ...the AH-HA  moment for me!!!  Mr. Glenn you brought it....  When Gabrielle Childers hires Nick Simmons a resourceful, street-smart, former Army specialist turned Private Invetigator to find her missing scientist brother, Simmmons thinks it's just another missing persons' case, but soon we're taken on a fast ride of intrique and mystery. This story is deep... and you've got to pay attention.   Sure, Nick rarely meets a woman he isn't attracted to, but he's a man's man and I like that... We quickly learn nothing is as it appears with Mrs. Childers as far as her missing brother or her secretive drug lord husband Chilly are concerned, they're all caught up in a scheme to develop synthetic crack turned deadly... but fear not... Nick Simmons is on the case... and I was with him all the way!!!!!  I really enjoyed Simmons' character-he seemed so real.. you know the type, rough around the edges, but good with the ladies.. he's carrying his own burden of betrayal but he's willing to make ammends for walking out on his buddy Black at a crucial time. (who doesn't love a man who's not afraid to show his vulnerability)  I also enjoyed the way Mr. Glenn kept me guessing... Just when I thought Nick and I had it figured out... Mr. Glenn tossed another twist.. without giving anything away, I can just say Nick is telling this story to a woman who has a history with Nick and his buddies... I enjoyed the story, the pacing, the characters-they were all so real-the plot, thick and deep, well thought out.  I'm hungry for more...  This was my first Roy Glenn story, but you can better believe it will not be the last! I'm about to go back and read Is it a Crime and Mob... I can not wait for Payback and anything else Glenn has in store for his fans.. know that I'll be in line come Feb... oh, wait-already pre-ordered mine! I suggest you do the same...    And I know he won't dissapoint 
 This has to one of the most funniest books ever!  I am now a Moore junkie who needs a support group. 
 I love the little jibe provided within the title of Hernando de Soto's "The Other Path."  It's a poke at "The Shining Path" (Sendero Luminoso), the Maoist Peruvian terrorist organization that wreaked havoc on de Soto's homeland beginning in 1980.  de Soto's attempt in this book is to show that the more effective struggle is to make capitalism more efficient.  To those who know de Soto's work, the solutions are well known: build a system of laws that allow one's residents to buy, sell and value property rights; and reduce the complexities and banalities of starting a business.  If you've read de Soto's master work "The Mystery of Capitalism," then there is no new news here.  In fact, "The Other Path" will look out-of-date with its yellowing statistics.  So why the five stars?  As a testament to de Soto's bravery.  Think about the guts it took for him to research and publish this book in Peru during the tumultuous and frightening period there.  What a statement. 
 The heroine of the story is coming to terms with her own understanding of  adulthood in a vile and destructive society.  She had been brought up to  distrust everyone and was trying to work out who she could have as a  friend.  Unfortunately she chooses the wrong person.  The fear that  everyone in Romania felt under the dictator Ceausescu is well shown in this  book.  It was a period when even a bar of chocolate was seen as a luxury.   Children in the UK and in the US will find it hard to believe much of the  story because it is so difficult to imagine not having videos and good  music and burgers and milkshakes.  Remember the orphans of Romania.  Their  lives were literally horrific.  It was better for the children at home with  their parents but not that much better.  A good book with a slightly  unexpected ending.  I wonder did they live happily ever after 
 As a younger person I owned quite a few vinyl albums. Amoung them were "Crystal Silence"(Gary Burton-Chick Corea), one of my all time favorite pre-new age jazz albums. I found the reissue of that CD years ago.   But my two most beloved jazz albums; moody, peaceful, emotional satisfying works are definitely "Diary" and "Solstice" by Ralph Towner.  Musically, these are all old friends whom I've never met and I'm glad to encounter once again many years later.  Reading at home alone on a rainy night or driving in the mountains on a snowy day in mid-Winter, this is the music to have. 
 This album is exactly what it advertises itself to be: a compendium of songs and comedy routines featuring the stereotypical Jewish immigrant parodies popular in vaudeville before the 1930's. PC it ain't, but a necessary piece of theatre history it is. To listen to Fanny Brice singing "Becky Is Back In The Ballet" is worth the price 
    Silly Sally is a book about her going to town and playing with animals.It's about her meeting a pig and meeting a dog on her way to town.IT'S a good book for kinderengarteners 
 When I saw this book come out I grabbed it! I have the previous book "Fix it and Forget it" and loved it. This one live's up to the predecessor. I barely knew how to cook before these 2 books. Now I can cook even without the slow cooker. This is a GREAT beginning cookbook, not just for entertaining 
 Alain Resnais does not neglect the blast of Hiroshima by wrapping it with a simple love-affair...  His film is puzzling, but, at the same time, a compromise, a promise, a pledge to human society... It is too daring by its conventional moral standards, distinguished in the way it was done, written, made and executed...  "Hiroshima, Mon Amour" is about the fortitude of man, with its mental and physical power... Alain Resnais and his writer-collaborator Marguerite Duras combined a love story with an anti-bomb story... They carry out the horror of Hiroshima and the sorrow of a lost first love...  Hiroshima is a tragedy that shocks us, while the story of love in Nevers makes us cry...  The story of Nevers does not trivialize the story of Hiroshima... We gasp at the tragedy of Hiroshima as we weep over the tragedy at Nevers... We contemplate a cosmic and a personal problem at the same time.  "Hiroshima, Mon Amour" is a new kind of film... It has great technical ability, illustrating hypothesis plus fact...  There is a close-up of Emmanuelle Riva , who has just glanced at Eiji Okada, asleep... Suddenly there is a brief flash-cut of the body of a wounded young man lying in approximately the same position in another place...  Resnais' camera moves like a stream from the present to the past and back to the present... It cuts back to Riva's face, and then back to Okada asleep, and in that split second the technique of the subliminal flash cut, used to describe a character's state of mind, is born...  This cut is the key to the film, for it is the man whom she calls 'Hiroshima' who reminds her of her lover at Nevers...  It is the tragedy of his race that reminds her of the small tragedy of her life...  This identification is carried through in the most neurotic moments of her recitative, when she looks at the Japanese and speaks to him as if he were her German lover of fourteen years before...  "Hiroshima, Mon Amour" reflects image and sound, past and present; the actual and the remembered; Hiroshima (a city of neon) and Nevers (a city of gray stone); the personal and the cosmic; a man and a woman; concern for the individual and concern for mankind...   
 Again some of the best books I have ever read!! Another good quartet after the Song of the Lioness Quartet! (The next ones, Kel's and Aliane'a are good too! Protector of the Small and The Lioness's Daughter) Daine's enchanting life and her "Wild Magic" powers bring her to a most interesting learning experience along with her teacher Numair Saliman (formally Arram Draper). These books are so very good 
 A very thought provoking yet still easy to read book. i would reccomendit to anyone even if you dont think meditation is you thing. 
 As a big March Madness fan, I couldnt help but check this book out from my local library. I love college basketball and especially the "Big Dance". This book is a great look behind the scenes at the Final Four and is full of valuable insight and interesting side stories.  Feinstein does a great job of really capturing the essence of the Final Four and the magnitude of the event from a coaches and players perspective. My favorite chapter is the chapter on the unsung players, the walk-ons the players that won't ever step foot on a NBA court and for them this is the pinnacle of their athletic career. I also enjoyed reading about the coaches, officials, and players that make the Final Four the greatest weekend in sports. A must read for the college basketball fan and a highly recommended one for anyone that loves sports 
 Trufully every reviewer is correct about the album so there isn't really much to say. Raekwon's debut "Only Built 4 Cuban Linx" remains a classic to this day. Back in '95 when Wu-Tang was still rising to the top of their game, Raekwon with the help of Ghostface Killah drops this classic. Lyrically both Raekwon and Ghostface spit each verse like it was their last one, going hard on tracks like "Criminology" and "Can It All Be So Simple 2". Alot of the rhyme subject in this album are something you can imagine in a movie (such as "Scarface") as they rhyme about drugs and money.  Guest appearances are also great too. Capadonna makes his debut on the song "Glaciers Of Ice" and the hit song "Ice Cream". My favorite is the Wu posse cut "Wu Gambinos" with RZA, Method Man, and Masta Killa. While Inspetah Deck and The Genius would join on one of my favorite Wu Tang tracks "Guillotine (Swords)". Nas would take part in the album also in the song "Verbal Intercourse". Production is razor sharp curteosy of RZA with the help of the 4th Deciple.  Overall great classic teamwork by Rae and Ghostface. If you don't own this album, I recommend that you purchase it as soon as you can. There would be more Ghostface and Rae colabs in later Wu albums (Ironman, Bulletproof Wallets, etc) but will not have the same momentum as this album here. Supposedly Raekwon is working on a "Only Built 4 Cuban Linx 2" but I haven't heard much about that project for a while. If you're a Wu fan, this is a must have.  My Favorite Tracks: Criminology, Incarcerated Scarfaces, Guillotine (Swords), Can It All Be So Simple 2, Glaciers Of Ice, Verbal Intercorse, Ice Cream, Wu Gambinos, Heaven & Hell, North Sta 
 Frank Sinatra (1915-1998) and Gene Kelly (1912-1996) play ball in big way as 1900s Vaudevillians who spend the winter flinging the onstage blarney and  the Summer flinging the ol?horsehide for Baseballs world champ , The Wolves . Sinatra is second sacker Dennis Ryan and Kelly is shortstop Eddie O?Brien in this Busby Berkeley (1895-1976) directed romp that conbines baseball with that other All-American pastime: Romance , Esther Williams (1922- ) plays the new team owner and Betty Garrett (1919- ) is abaseball Annie with eyes for blue-eyed Ryan (Frankie Boy) . Kelly and Stanley Donen (1924- ) deft musical stagings ranged from softshoe duet charmer to exciting "barrel role" Kelly solo . Their work persuated producer Arthur Freed (1894-1973) to green-ligt their direction of the same year?s "On the Town 1949" . Here you have Baseball , Romance , Dancing and a Cult movie in  one set ! . Transfer in High Quality pictures . Recommende 
 This is an excellent first book for Ben Rice. It's both beach reading and intellectually stimulating, with the simplicity of words and narrative. It's fantastic without being unbelievably so. And at the end, the author made me believe the story can really happen. I'd stretch my suspended disbelief and look forward to reading more of Rice's work 
 We've been living in a new city searching for a church where we could invite any of our friends, regardless of their background, life situation, and past church experience (or lack of), without fear of putting them in an uncomfortable situation.  A much larger order to fill than we had expected, because, as it turns out, many people are NOT comfortable in church--period!  This book explains how that has come to be and why churches are struggling, but, most importantly, it demonstrates exactly how churches and ALL Christians can (and should) reach out to and meet the needs of an ultra-diverse population with diverse backgrounds, lifestyles and situations.  This is NOT "watered-down Christianity" or "moral relativism"--contrarily, it is biblical Christianity in its best, purest, most powerful and effective (and user-friendly) form.  For ANYONE interested in effectively reaching the seemingly unreachable.  The author is incredibly engaging and easy to read, but be warned that the substance might just change your perspective on church and religion!           
 This book came to my attention from a long review of it that appeared in the   Intl. Herald Tribune by William F Buckley of all people. It is all that he said and then some. It is clearly written for the expert, and so there is a lot that is beyond both my interest and abilities, but there is enough that I seek to keep me engaged. Now, I admit my interest in Bach is highly specialised: I am a novelist and seek to place Bach alongside Caspar David  Friedrich, Germany's great romantic painter, and Goethe all in various settings, but mostly in Dresden, Leipzig and Luebeck, which this book turns out to be highly useful. Handsomely bound and highly readable. A wonderful addition to a serious reader's library 
 The book is everything it promises to be: no-nonsense, to the point, common sense, and with concrete investment advice. The problem (for non US residents) is that the recommended products, tax-advantages, etc. only apply to the USA. If anybody knows about a European equivalent, let me know 
 I read the review from the reviewer who had "figured out who did it" halfway through the book.  Yes, I suspected who did it also.  But, there was still the element of surprise as to how everything would turn out, etc.  It seemed like a hopeless situation when I realized the perpetrator.  I listened to the audio version of this book.  I usually only listen to audio books as I walk.  However, when I got to the point of finding our who the hit and run driver was, I couldn't stop listening.  I listened to the last two cassettes non-stop all morning long.  If I had been reading it, it would have been a true page turner until I reached the end.  I recommend this story highly.  It is different than The Notebook and The Wedding, and I applaud Nicholas Sparks as a writer 
 Very good product. Fast delivery. AAA+++. Please leave me positive feedback, if it is allowed.   Thanks. God is good.  Martha in TN sngwrtrm 
 I am a Special Education teacher.  I use this cookbook all the time for my readers and non-readers.  The pictures are great and easy to understand what they need to buy.  The directions are easy to follow.  The recipies are made from common items that are easy to find in a grocery store.  It is the most used cookbook that I have in my room!! 
 David Keymer's otherwise excellent review contains a misplaced recollection of the original Downbeat review.  Don Gold gave it 4 1/2 stars, calling Evans' work "exhilarating" and "'must' listening for musicians," while hailing the importance of his contribution to the development of jazz. Gold does in fact give 3 1/2 stars to "New Bottle Old Wine" because of Cannonball Adderly's performance, which he feels is not up to the level of Evans' writing. In my opinion both are essential recordings.  
 If you are an INFP, on the Myers Briggs personality preference inventory, I hope you read this book.  I found much of myself in this book and was able to fill in the missing pieces to many of the reasons that I am not satisfied with my career.  I have started on a new career path of my own.  Thanks to this book I have more understanding and courage to make a change in my life at 42 years old 
 I needed to understand how domain names and webhosting worked, plus design, program, test, and implement a website quickly.  This book was perfect -- extremely well-organized, with a good Table of Contents and index, excellent examples and helpful (but not overwhelming) reference tables.  The book had sufficient detail that I could get graphics loaded and use some CSS to make my text look more professional.  I launched a good-looking, no-frills site for a club without any fancy animation, and got it up and running in a less than a month of evenings and weekends.  The demo software (BBEdit) was invaluable to getting me started.  Good treatment as well of issues with .gif, .jpeg, and .png files, and I feel that I can still learn more from this text should I want to make the site more sophisticated.  The discussion of tables was especially clear.  I recommend this book for anyone, even if you've never designed your own site or written a lick of html. Those wanting to do online forms to allow users to submit data will need to learn Javascript.  
 There are a lot of movie buffs, including Hitchcock fans, who have never gotten around to seeing "Stage Fright", coming as it does in the Master's transition period between sparkling who-done-its and hard-edged thrillers. That's a shame, because "Stage Fright" has a little bit of everything we love from Hitch: wit, romance, intrigue, drama, and in the end, genuine chills.  The film stars Jane Wyman as Eve, a dramatic student who finds herself aiding and abetting the fugitive Jonathan (effectively played by Richard Todd). She loves him, you see, and since he is apparently being set up for a murder rap by no less a femme fatale than Marlene Dietrich, she is determined to clear his name at any cost.   And so Eve is forced into playing her greatest role ever; impersonating  lady's maid to Dietrich in order to catch the vamp in her lies. She is assisted in this by her father, "The Commodore", played by the wonderful Alastair Sim. Sim gets off most of the films best lines, and joins a host of rich side characters. There is also the requisite detective (yummy Michael Wilding) whom Eve both fears and gradually begins to admire (prompting her Father to remark, "I hope you're not thinking of changing horses midstream?").   Close calls, wild chases, misplaced trust and bloodstained dresses all culminate in an exciting conclusion that should satisfy mystery fans and film buffs alike.  Everything considered I would put "Stage Fright" at the top of Hitchcock's second tier films (behind first tier masterpieces like "Notorious" and "The Lady Vanishes"). Don't let this one pass you by!  GRADE: B 
 Richard Jordan's delightful history of "Mame" is an easy read, full of terrific theatrical tales and bits of trivia that is perfect for any theatre-goer, and especially lovers of everyone's favorite Aunt.  With  the announcement that Streisand may do a TV version of "Mame", I  hope that Mr. Jordan will write a follow-up detailing Barbra's trek through  the world of Auntie Mame 
 My review can be summarized as a well recommended movie that is worth at least a rental.   But the movie may be worth buying since its release is a blockbuster for the Holidays and has been deeply discounted. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and I would have given it a 3 and a half, if possible. The reason why it is not a four but still a strong three is that the movie was enjoyable and was able to keep a certain amount of suspense throughout but is not something I would watch over again.   The movie moves quickly enough and, with out giving anything away, doesn't play the "Hollywood" card very much.   The acting and visual elements were done well.   The bonus DVD has some interesting behind the scenes value, especially because the film was done in some very historically significant locations. 
 Our 16 month old daughter loves this DVD. The images are excellent and the music is delightful 
 In Words and Rules, Pinker manages to condense and tie together an unbelievable amount of research. Reading this book carefully (i.e. really absorbing the densely packed information) and looking up some of its references is probably equivalent to a good undergraduate degree in linguistics.  Pinker has a knack for teasing apart all the different threads that make up a hugely complex subject, exploring each one with arguments and data from different academic currents, and then tying them up again so the reader can form a much better picture of the whole. And that's exactly what he does in this flawlessly well-written book.  The only problem with Words and Rules is its packaging: it's marketed as a popular science book for the general public, but unlike The Language Instinct and How the Mind Works, it can probably only be properly appreciated by either serious "language hobbyists" or linguists (I am both).  If you don't have a fairly good background, or at least a serious interest, in linguistics, you'll probably find this book too dense (at any rate, it's definitely not "light reading"). If you're a linguist (pure or applied), here's another real gem from Steven Pinker 
 This book is an enjoyable, informative look into a classic, American Guitar company, Gretsch. Its picure gallery alone will keep you reaching for it again and again. Jay's passion with Gretsch guitars shows. Of  particular interest is the section on the Duo Jet, and its sister, the  Silver Jet. The only book like it on the market today. Five stars 
 As usual with great works, the critics will come on here and give it one star.  True, there may be somewhat weak tracks here and there, but... overall, this is a masterpiece.  From the standpoint of "sound" and production, it is one of the best "sounding" albums (by any artist) I've ever heard.  There is an incredible mix, that is simultaneously rich, deep, open, and powerful.  From the standpoint of performance, all the members of the band are at their best.  Especially Jason.  I think this album really lets his talent truly shine as never before.  The best songs are those where Jason takes the lead:  Explain It To My Heart, What Does It Take, Man to Woman, If It Were You, Holding On, You Come to My Senses.  Explain It To My Heart is the best track.  What Does It Take is 2nd best, which most people overlook it.  Man To Woman is like "What Kind of Man Would I Be" Part 2, and it's phenomenal.  Holding On is a beautiful song.  Robert's voice sounds stellar on "One From the Heart" and "Only Time...".  Bill also sounds incredible throughout, especially on Explain It To My Heart.   The horns, the bass, Bailey's guitar playing, the keys, everything is at an all time high.  In some ways, this is the best Chicago record ever.  Chasin the Wind is a great song, and truly one of Bill's best vocal performances, but I think it was a poor choice for 1st single.  I think because it is too much like the singles he sang on from album # 19.  Again, the track is fantastic, but... I think it was too similar to the songs the public was exposed to last time around.  They probably would have been better releasing What Does It Take or maybe Explain It To My Heart.  It's too bad this record got so little exposure.  The band didn't even perform any of the songs from it on their tour after releasing it.  Anyway, this is a great album.  For those who keep putting them down for doing "power ballads," why are you listening to this band if you don't like ballads?  They've ALWAYS been about ballads, from day one!  And especially since the late 70's.   
 I HAVE ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK VERY MUCH AND i WOULD READ THE BOOK AGAIN SO IF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE LOVE STORY THEN YOU WOULD ENJOY READING THE BOOK LOVE STORY LIKE I DID 
 no hitches, no complaints at all.  delivery came in even earlier than promised. 
 This movie is by far one of the best comedy musicals of all time.  Zero Mostel plays his role as Pseudolus excellently, and the songs that go along with the hilarious antics are amazing.  One only needs to listen to the song "Everybody Ought to Have a Maid" and you will be rolling on floor in laughter 
 This disc provided me with some long sought after tunes from my youth. Typically the disc contains songs I tolerated, a few I never heard of, However, the producers sought to include songs which mean something to many.  
 I definitely like this type of military history. It touches a chord with you by more or less tracking a handful of representative marines and civilians throughout their entire experience in WWII, with the siege and eventual fall of Wake being the central act of the book. It very successfully weaves their personal stories together with overview descriptions of the battle and analysis of how the battle was proceeding.   The book starts with introducing its cast of characters. Many are small town or rural guys growing up in the Depression. For the most part they find themselves signing up in the Marines or joining a construction company that works on foreign military bases to get a job rather than join the ranks of the unemployed.   Life on Wake before the start of the war wasn't so bad apparently. Getting there involved a great time for a romp during the stopover in Hawaii, an exotic paradise that was also usually the first place the guys had seen beyond their hometown. Construction work on the island was performed both by the workers and the marines. They worked long hours and they were detached from their families, but there wasn't much else to do on Wake (a spit of three sand islands that barely jut out from the ocean) but work. Food was good, as was the medical care, and a camaraderie developed even before the start of the war.   Pearl Harbor of course changes everything on the island. One of the amazing things however is just how little those on Wake knew of the extent of the disaster to the U.S. Navy there. Throughout the entire siege they expected to see the Navy steam in over the horizon and summarily dispatch the Japanese. They wouldn't learn about how bad Pearl Harbor really was for three more years.   The defense of Wake was not easy, and the holdouts tenacity and bravery shines through in abundance. Radar had not yet been installed by the time the war started, the ship which was to deliver it was recalled when Pearl Harbor was struck. Being a low reef island there was no high ground nor any natural cover. The sound of crashing surf was so loud throughout the entire island that usually the first sign of a Japanese air raid would be bombs exploding on the airfield.   The description of the fighting is vivid, you really are pulling for the guys even though you know that they will eventually be defeated. There are a few tactical victories that they manage wrest from the Japanese however. The tiny two plane Wake Air Force downs a surprisingly large number of Japanese planes, including the plane and crew that landed the fatal blow to the USS Arizona just weeks earlier. The small number of guns on the island are fired with skill and care, enough so to sink a Japanese destroyer that strays too closely. When the Japanese finally do land a serious invasion force on each of the three small islands, one of the islands actually repels the entire force. Unfortunately the commanding officer (who comes off admirably) is not aware of this fact, but is aware that food and ammunition is running out, the other two islands are falling, and that the writing is on the wall. In a bitter moment he surrenders.   The Japanese were not "good winners" in WWII. The survivors of the siege were split up, and the book follows the group that is sent to Chinese prison camps mostly. Their journey to China via Japan on a transport is ghastly, as is their internment till the very end of the war. The separate group left on Wake were forced to rebuild the defenses in case of an American attack. Few of them survived the brutality of the Japanese Commanding Officer left in charge of the island though.   By following the men throughout their entire experience in the war this book gives a complete representation of what the human experience was on Wake, and not just a description of the battle. It's a great story of triumph, defeat, survival, and endurance. 
 I have two 3 year old daughters who love all of the Richard Scarry videos.  This video helped them recognize and learn their ABC's much better than me quizzing them with flashcards all summer!  They will watch this video every day if I let them

 My apologies in advance to the legion of fans out there, but somehow the idea of a "good" Frank Sinatra film seems oxymoronic.  But this is a fine film, with Sinatra believable as the American martinet, and a simply outstanding supporting cast.  I must single out for special mention the wonderful performance by Edward Mulhare, a much underrated actor, who rarely had the opportunity to show what he could do.  His performance as Father Costanza is a gem, and one of the elements that makes this movie really work (and his German is excellent!) 
 I red this book once and about thirty years ago. I remained immediately impressed by the original and strange way to face problems of communications between traders, brokers and the entire world around the  stock exchanges of the world. After so many years, I still remember the  intriguing profoundness of its contents and now I know how the entire  financial world is totally dominated  by these unsolved problems of  communication much more that by rationale behaviour and logic reactions of  people involved 
 According to my 11-year-old daughter, this is a classic case of "Don't judge a book by its cover." "I thought it would be boring, since there is only grass on the cover, but it was the best book I  ever read," she said. She was fascinated by the details about the  nitty-gritty of prairie life, by the size of the families and the constancy  of the chores. She's looking forward to reading Warren's book, "Orphan  Train Rider," and wants the author to hurry up and write more 
  It's never too late to get with the program.  See my primary review of "The Five Love Languages" for additional details.  This author has a simple formula, easy to understand and easy to apply.  This book is the best possible gift for both new and long-standing parents, especially in this age to two-income families, striving to fit too much into each day, and in the face of the Internet and television as a corosive alternative to parenting.  I'm no saint--barely competent as a parent--this book is in my case a badly needed intervention.  It took three children for me to figure this stuff out.  Buy five copies and gently make a difference to five families 
 I've been using this product for a few years now, and it always rescues me when my eczema pops up in the cold weather.  I once did a comparison between cortisone cream and Dream Cream, and the Dream Cream won hands down because it kept the scalies away longer than the cortisone did.  The scent is lavender/herbal and very nice. 
 If you are just getting started in your personal relationship with your Angels, this is the place to start.  Doreen Virtue used to recommend her book, Healing with the Angels, to help people begin their journey with connecting with their Angels.  However, she felt prompted to really focus on a 'basic' how to book, which is why her book is titled, "Angels 101".  This is an excellent resource, for it helps answer many of your questions regarding Angels.  You are introduced to the Archangels and what each specializes in.  There is an explanation that as your intuition grows, you'll see colors and what the colors represent.  This is a great way to get started.  As you move forward in your relationship with your Angels, I highly recommend attending a Doreen Virtue class.  I received my certification as an Angel Therapy Practitionerï¿½ and it was such a healing experience for me.  Doreen is an amazing teacher and I'm grateful for all she teaches, for now I have such a wonderful friendship with the Angels and Archangels.  It's a great journey...I am glad I'm on it!  Angel Blessings, Anni 
 For school administrators who need some tips/helpful hints or for those aspiring to become school administrators....  This is a must read!  Although not read like a novel, this written tool gives much needed advice  for handling situations that eduators and administrators must face in  today's world.  This should be in every administrator's office and in every  graduate student's curriculum

 This text with versions of Rumi is wonderful for its contemporary language and revelation of Rumi's insights which read as if they came out of a psychologically astute book of modern poetry.  My partner and I used Quatrains # 388 and #158 in our wedding ceremony. In this thirteenth century visionary writing I once again am reminded of the ageless quality of human insight and wisdom with its imperative that we remain alert to revelation about to burst upon us.  The introduction Moyne and Bark have written for it is a sweet gift as well. "Open Secret" is a keeper 
 Cover to cover, this book if full with usefull command reference. As a test prep tool, I was able to memorized IOS command with much more ease. 
 Loved it then. Love it now. This show is fun, romantic, dramatic when it needs to be and light hearted in all the right spots. I fell in love with the characters as a teenager - as fell in love with them all over again watching this show now in my mid 30's. Stephanie Zimbalist made this show and Stephanie Zimbalist was made for this role. I am sure it must have felt like a pigeon hole to her at times since, but I thank her for filling it so perfectly. I am a BIG Pierce Brosnan fan and think he was wonderful in his role as well. Nothing aginst him - he rocks! I'm just saying Stephanie Z. is the icing on this cake.  When I think of the arcaic nature of some aspects of their relationship as well as the fundamental reason for Laura's creation of Steele, even the feelings of frustration are valid to the point of the show and therefore only add to the experience. All in all, this show was a staple for a generation, coming of age in an age of transition. It was as much of a model for some of us as it was a reflection of our times. It stands up and yells, "When bigotry and idiocy try to keep you down, use their idiocy to push through their garbage. The only thing that can keep you from success is believing the lies! Don't give in to it. Use it and make your own way!" She is our hero 
 I remember when this series was first aired on my local PBS station.  Sadly I never got to watch the entire series.  When an online friend mentioned this last fall I immediately put both I&II on my Christmas list. Now I am pre-ordering series III and cant wait.    I can only imagine I am one of the Eliott girls, designing dresses, and living in London in the 1920's.  The costumes are to die for, the story line interesting, and the acting supburb.  If you are a sewer/costumer and/or lover of the Jazz age, this series is for you 
 Quite possibly their best, this album is a must have for Yo La Tengo fans. It's also an excellent introduction for newcomers. If you're thinking about buying this album, BUY IT! You won't be disappointed 
 The beauty of the book is how Chopra wrote it for everyone.  We are all spiritual beings following a spiritual path.  And it is the same path.  Whether Chopra is a multimillionaire or not makes no difference (he is).  Whether he has a multitude of critics makes no difference either (he does).  I have a few cautions for the reader and then hopefully I'll convince you that the book is worth reading.  Chopra's style perhaps encourages the reader not to think critically about the subjects he writes of.  Since God is the ultimate subject, I found (and most people will find) that I had to simply take most of the book as from authority.  This definitely does not mean some of the subjects can't be debated.  Ergo, it is not the kind of book that can be read through once and then forgotten.  Chopra leads the reader through a process in his books that most people will not wrap their minds around in one reading.  I've only read the book cover to cover once but I've waded through part of the material again at least a dozen times.  Chopra's idea for the book is hardly original (it's from a source thousands of years old).  But the great service he does is introducing it to the average reader.  I can honestly say (after only a month or two of buying the book) that it has changed my life.  Chopra describes where God is "from" (the quantum domain) and explains God's manifestations in the universe to the extent that the subject can be explained.  So a person finds his or her self with consciousness, and in some stage (one of seven) of experiencing God.  His explanation of the seven stages of spirituality or experiencing God should make it clear to you what stage you are in and even clue you in on how to reach the next stage, if that is what you want.  Fight or flight/reactive/restful awareness/intuitive/creative/visionary/enlightened  Every last person in the world falls fits into one of the stages above.  Your answer cannot be the wrong answer.  Saying that the 'fight or flight' stage is the lowest stage in a way is incorrect.  It is not bad or wrong to be at that stage.  It may be right or good to be 'enlightened' at stage seven although it can ultimately only be right or good for you.  I've thought of many extensions to ponder regarding this theory of God and experiencing God (for example, in my opinion 80-90% of people are probably in stage one or two).  Chopra combines modern theories of physics with mystical insights in a very approachable, thoughtful format.  He delineates and describes all seven stages and gives further ideas of how the universe's intelligence manifests itself.  Every last page is worth reading.  The book is not for everyone, but on the other hand I wish everyone would read it.  If you buy the book and regret it, please give it to someone who may enjoy it!  eco 
 It is, in my opinion, the second best Anne book! Its Anne's wedding! The whole thing is soaked in romance! Leslie's story is so amazing and sweet that you have to love her. Captain Jim is so sweet and perfect, you can nearly see him. Miss Cornelia is funny and Susan is great. Anne has to deal with tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful. The only thing I don't like, is that i wish Marrilla and all the Avonlea people would be in it a little more. In my opinion, this should be where the series ends 
     THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COMPELLING MYSTERY WITH SUCH A TWIST IN THE ENDING THAT YOU DON'T SEE COMING.  SAM ELLIOT AS USUAL GAVE A GREAT PERFORMANCE.  HE CAN PLAY SUCH AN ARRAY OF PARTS  AND DOES A GREAT JOB IN THIS MOVIE 
 When it comes to finding a perfect compilation that serves as a definitive statement of what Def Leppard is all about, one should look no further than "Rock of Ages: The Definitive Collection". Packed with 35 songs spanning 25 years, "Rock of Ages" is a quintessential introduction to band for those just discovering them. For the diehards, it's a great opportunity to have all the big hits as well as some popular album cuts all in one place. Classics such as the title track, "Photograph", "Foolin'", "Armageddon It", "Animal", "Hysteria", "Love Bites" and "Pour Some Sugar On Me" are all included here and bring back memories of when the band was at the forefront of their popularity. In addition to the classic hits from the band's defining "Pyromania" and "Hysteria" albums, there are also plenty of tracks from "High N Dry" and "Adrenalize" as well as as two from their debut "On Through The Night" and a few from their underated recent period ("Slang", "Euphoria" and "X") and a sneak-peak at their recently released cover album, "Yeah!" as represented by the track "No Matter What" (originally by Badfinger).  The CD booklet includes several photos of the band from the last 20 years as well as track commentary by its current members. Altogether, this is probably the best Def Leppard compilation out there. Yes, there are a few tracks that should've been on here ("Make Love Like A Man" and "Gods Of War" come to mind) but what we have here is definitely not anything weak by a longshot. As mentioned above, this serves as a great introduction to the band and is THE place to get all the greatest hits in one place.  Definitely Definitive Def Leppard.  Also recommended: High N Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria - the definitive Def Leppard album trilogy in my opinion 
 Fresh, passionate, full on game and life- very good party-music, very professional too 
 This delightful story has a reputation for being very sentimental, and it is, but it is also filled with humour.  Cedric Errol, an all-American boy, discovers to his dismay that he is the heir to an English earldom, and has to go to England to live with his stern old grandfather, who despises Americans (he must have been reading the Guardian, I suppose).  Gradually they learn to like each other, and the grandfather even comes around to liking Cedric's American mother.  There is a melodromatic sub-plot involving a false heir, but the story is really interesting enough without it.  The best character in the book is Cedric's friend Mr. Hobbs, a staunchly Republican grocer who despises earls "I'd like to catch one of em inside here; that's all!" he tells Cedric, before he knows Cedric is one of them "I'll have no graspin tyrants sittin round on my buiscuit barrels!"  By the end of the book though, he has become so attached to Cedric that he sells his grocery business and settles in England, where he becomes an avid follower of aristocratic doings. He says he'll never return to America "It's a good enough country for them that's young and stirrin - but there's faults in it.  there's not an aunt-sister among em - nor an earl!"  Which pretty much sums up how I feel about America too 
 I found this book is extremely useful. A few times last month that I was getting headaches; after I followed the instructions from the book, the headaches was gradually disappeared. I also tried the acupressure on my knee (I have RA)and I felt better the next day. I strongly recommend this book to other readers. 
 The easy spirit bootie is just what I was looking for. Comfortable and yet stylish. I can wear with pants or skirts. dress up or down. The zipper on both sides of bootie make it very easy to slip on. Your feet stay dry in rain or snow. I love my booties 
 Okay, the reviewer below is wrong about a couple things: A-Jesus said angels "in Heaven" don't marry; he wasn't talking about ones that might take human form! Also, Enoch never in this text is a mediator between  God and men. Even if he was, Jesus didn't become the mediator until his  rise to Heaven.  Now for the actual review: While much of the Intro is wild  speculation to say the least, ( I doubt the NT was as influenced by  "Enoch" as Mr. Charles thinks ) it is still an invaluable  document in studying how the Jews did eagerly await a PERSONAL Messiah and  they believed in an EARTHLY manifestation of His Kingdom.  The Book of  Enoch is stunning in it's glowing poetry and vivid images; this text was of  great importance to both William Blake and even modern day Anne Rice.  I  doubt strongly this is some "lost book" of the Bible, but it has  added so much to my faith in the canonical Scriptures that I heartily urge  ANY lover of the Word, or truth-seeker, to obtain and study this  fascinating ancient text 
 Stephen King has always been an enigma to me.  Once in a while there's some pretty good adaptations of his novels("Carrie, "The Shining", "Misery") though it's his short works that seem to have produced the better films("Stand by Me", "The Shawshank Redemption", "The Green Mile").  "The Dead Zone" falls in the category of slightly above average thanks to the stellar direction of horror-meister David Cronenberg and a top-notch cast led by Christopher Walken.  There were moments of deja vu here where I felt the film was derivative of a "Twilight Zone" or "Outer Limits" episode but there's also some genuine inspired moments as well.  King has some interesting things to say about telepathy and the responsiblities of those imbued with it.  Walken has a sympathetic turn here as the telepath whose psychic abilities are foisted on him.  Good supporting work by vets Herbert Lom as Walken's physical therapist, Tom Skeritt as a local sheriff, cult fave Anthony Zerbe("The Omega Man", TV's "Harry-O") as a father who hires Walken to tutor his son.  Martin Sheen's work here kind of anticipates "The West Wing".  Think of Josiah Bartlett's evil twin.  Not bad but could have used more cowbell 
 A lot of screenwriting books out there can be great sources on what to do and what not to do while writing a screenplay.  This book is not like those...it's better.  It's like sitting down with a handful of screenwriters and disscussing the process from start to finish.  This is advice and multiple views on many of the essential parts of screenwiriting straight from the horses mouth.  This is a book that can jump start you if you fall behind and give you what you need to make it through your screenplay.  This is a must have 
 My daughter had wanted this book for a long time.  She enjoys it and uses many hairstyles from it.  Another great product for tween aged girls from the American Girl company

 I have heard Charlie Jones speak many times.  His program designed to turn his kids into readers worked in my family too.  This little book is a real gem.  It can be a lifesaver on days when there seems no place to turn to for encouragement.  His persaonal responsibility attitude is much needed today.  Rather than looking for the most fulfilling job or purpose in life it is far more useful to be responsible and turn our lives into positive and purposful examples for others.  Life truly can be tremendous if one has the right perspective.  Charlie can help you there 
 This book amazed me on how accurate and truthful it was.  It contains many many quotes of Lennon which supports every bit of information presented.  I originally borrowed the book from a library for a school project and was very unhappy about having to give it back!  I would have loved to have kept it.  It is a must have for any John Lennon fan 
 This picture will satify a wide audience.The story line treats with our Declaration of Independence and how it was protected from being stolen by a very dedicated family who were involved in american history from colonial times.A must see for excitement and hidden clues.The good part is that you can view this  film more than one time and and still enjoy it 
 My 16 month old daughter is not overly excited by most books and loses intrest quickly, but she loves this book and can play with it for an hour. She loves to bring it to us to read with her, and she loves lifting the flaps and she giggles at her accomlishment of showing us where "baby's belly button/eyes/hands etc" are.  I would recommend this book because its great for interaction between your child and you, the illistrations are colorful and cute, and it helps toddlers learn different body parts 
 I am an avid fan of the Marcus Didius Falco series.  I found this book harder to get into, but the end was well worth it. Helena's pregnancy makes the story more interesting.  At first, the cartel situation is rather complicated, but as you read along and get a feel for the story, you'll find the book worth the time 
 David Clevelands book is a terrific read and an important original contribution to debunking the long held opinion that the American Tonalist art movement was a minor footnote and a backward looking reflection of the times in which Americans were seeking a simpler world and a return to agrarian life in America instead of Tonalism as being the Whistlerian army of the modern movement in art.  His well researched book shows without question that Tonalism was a dominate force in American Art during the period 1880-1915 documenting the significant collections in which these works of art were held and that the leading art dealers of the period and art organizations were dominated by these artists.  The book forces us to reevaluate the common view that the Acedemic paintings of American artists trained in Europe and that of the artists of the Hudson River School (1840-1890) was replaced by Impressionism.  In fact the art movements of Tonalism, Impressionism and the Realists (Henri's art for life's sake) lived side by side especially after 1900 and many artists went back and forth between these approaches to painting life-Tonalism as an underlying approach for many.  Mr. Cleveland has compilied a comprehensive list of the artists who practiced this type of painting and has even catagorized them into first and second generation painters.  This is a bonus for art collectors who want to know what artists to look for when collecting Tonalist paintings. Insights from the book that I found to be of particular interest were the major influence Tonalism held on the Arts & Crafts movement, the influence of Tonalism on early American modern photography (Steiglitz/Photo-Sessions Group) with its same essential qualities and the tie-in with American transcendentalism espoused by Emerson and Thoreau reflecting its spiritual and aesthetic values shown in pictorial form verses in written word.  It is also a refreshing change to see an art history book focused on a period or movement thru an artist such as Charles Warren Eaton who is lesser known today but who was well known,actively exhibited and collected in their time. All too often I find art history is only written about a few prominent painters and as such does not give the reader a broader perspective and insight into a given art movement.  This book does just that and is well worth reading and a must for anyone serious about the study of American Art 
 As a long time vegetarian with two small children, I'm always looking for ways to make good healthy veggie coooking "family friendly".  This cookbook succeeds marvellously!  In a few short months the pages have become well loved--the tahini dressing is now a staple in our fridge, the mushroom/wild rice soup (vegan, at that!) in much demand in the winter months.  I have yet to make something that didn't turn out delicious!    Haedrich has an enjoyably readable style, and the anecdotes about his children's likes and dislikes and family traditions make this a "read it cover to cover" cookbook.  There are plenty of suggestions about how to modify recipes for picky kids (perish the thought!), or how to perk up the same recipe to make it more "grown up".  I love the author's understanding of what it is really like to cook with a family--no pristine test kitchen recipes here.  If you are looking for delicious, hearty, healthy and kid-friendly dishes, this is an absolute gem 
 I am very very happy with this item.  However, I only gave it five stars not because of the product but because of how the package came.  The box was tattered and looked like it would have fallen apart any second.  Also, I had to run to Lowe's to pick up additional nuts and bolts in order to finish setting up the bench because they were not in the package.  Still, for such a heavy piece of equipment, it came in record time, really really fast. I use the bench three days a week for my strenght training sessions.  A really really good buy for the price.  Trust me, I researched tons of other benches before deciding on this one.  You are not going to find another bench with all this equipment for this price.  Like another reviewer wrote, you would end up having to pay around $250-$400 for all that comes with this bench.   If you are looking for a good home gym to start out with, this is it.  Not to mention, it really doesn't take up that much space and as it states in its description, it can be folded.  Also, it is of good quality.  Very sturdy, something that I am sure should last me for years.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT FOR ANOTHER SECOND.  BUY THIS BENCH.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  
 After reading his Illuminations, I decided that I definitely wanted to encounter more of Arthur Rimbaud. I was intrigued by his creative proposition that in order to become engaged with existence the poet must place himself at variance with life. This positioning of the poet in surging counter-subjectivity to life is somewhat Hegelian in that it induces not only a creative synthesis but suffering as its essential Muse. While A Season in Hell is mature Rimbaud toward the end of his life, the Drunken Boat is clearly his finest individual poem. One discovers a symbolic clarity in this single work that summarizes his amazing thirst for life and the human condition in a brief poem of only 25 stanzas. This really is a magnificent work reminiscent of Blake with a style and a passion that transformed his genre and left him immortal. I earnestly invite you to read this telling, visually rich and important work by a major poet of immense talent. It will broaden the palette through which you perceive the brush strokes and colors of your life's impressions 
 I loved it!  I read both books and I can't wait for the next and hope to see a movie.  
 I am a small animal veterinarian at an emergency clinic and I give this book to clients when they lose a pet.  It is very colorful and easy to read, and appeals to all ages.  I have purchased other books of this nature but like this one the best for its bright colorful illustrations and wording -- not too much like the Rainbow Bridge, and even though God is featured prominently throughout the book I have never worried about offending someone's religious beliefs with it.  Either I've gotten lucky and not handed it out to a non-believer or everyone just "gets" that it's meant to be a comforting story and takes from it what they need. Highly recommended for all ages -- have seen grown men cry over this book, and the little ones love to read it over and over to help them remember a pet 
 These are great books.  Much more than historical fiction these are classic tales set during the Napoleonic Wars.  Great characters and historically acurate.  A highly recommend Desolation Island and the entire Aubrey series.  The books keep getting better!!!! 
 BABYFACE NEVER LACKS CREATIVITY.FOR A WHILE I THOUGHT'THE DAY' WAS HIS BEST ALBUM.THEN CAME THIS ALBUM...REAL ADULT CONTEMPORARY R&B....OF COURSE ITS FOR THE GROWN&SEX 
 Land of the Lawn Weeiens is number one in all of the books I've read. It seems that you are in the sane place at the same time. The other reason is that this book has a series of stories not just one. Buy this book right here right now!!! 
 Hands down, this is the best budget stereo system for the price. Period. 
 I found the book both informative and well written.  Having lived in the  Texas Panhandle for 21 years, I could easily relate to the area.  What made  the book double interesting for me was the way it helped me to connect the  dots, so to speak, of the period since some of my acquaintences lived  through that period 
 My family will forever be changed (for the better) by this book.  We found so many things in it that explain our daughters difficulty with school work.  The best part is how they recognize that it isn't a "disorder" just a different way the mind works.  The book is full of examples of highly successful people who have ADD.  A must read if you have any concerns about yourself or your childs ability to focus 
 I love this book! I have been using it for about 10 years and wanted the new edition. The author explains the energy-based philosophy of Eastern Nutrition in a clear, understandable way. I love the explanation of grains and their value, how to transition to a mostly vegetarian way of eating, fasting, juicing, and so much more 
 I am shocked at some of the bad reviews below....  I guess the book was set up well for me because I can see how someone just picking this up at random could find it quite boring.  I was suggested to read this from a friend who told me it was one of the best books she has ever read in her life, but yet one of the worst stories.  I love the book, though.  Jubal makes a great comment that really relates how I view "Stranger in a Strange Land"  "Anybody can see a pretty girl.  An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become.  A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl she used to be.  A great artist can look at an old woman, portray her exactly as she is... and force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be... more than that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo see that this lovely young girl is still alive, prisoned inside her ruined body.  He can make you feel the quiet, endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who ever grew older than eighteen in her heart... no matter what the merciless hours have done."  The story and plot itself is, honestly, a boring old woman compared to other stories "meant" to excite you.  I feel I see so many of the points behind the actual story itself, though.  If you really analyze this book as you read (which isn't hard because Heinlein does a great job of almost forcing you to think and relate), you will see so many relevancies to so many things.  Beyond that, the concept, if read and understood from start to finish, is quite genius.  Buy this book and be prepared.  This is a trip and a work of art.  You must treat is as a work of art and give it the attention it deserves.  The more attention you put into it, the more you will get out of it at the end.  Enjoy 
 Stuart has aptly named this book. She employs a perfect balance of humor and tender moments in this rollicking good read. I carried it everywhere with me for two days. Whether standing in line at the grocery store or picking up the dry-cleaning, I was reading and either laughing or sighing, but never was I bored.   Balancing Act is delightful and fresh. The spiritual thread is honest and definitely not preachy. It's a book a non-Christian could enjoy without rolling their eyes. Heidi's sarcastic wit lightens the moments that could easily have become schmaltzy or lumbering.   Like a virtuoso, Stuart delivered the denouement with a fresh approach that rang with honesty--a huge debut novel, in this reviewer's opinion. Balancing Act receives Novel Reviews' highest recommendation.  Reviewed by Ane Mulligan www.anemulligan.com 
 Few events in the twentieth century did as much to shape the world in which we live than the fall of the British Empire.  Every corner of the globe bears some stamp of its once-mighty presence, yet only now are we beginning to understand its true impact and legacy.  In this book, Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper focus on British rule in southern Asia - India, Burma, Malaya, and Singapore - during the Second World War, showing not just how that conflict accelerated the collapse of their empire in the region but how it set the parameters of the subsequent course it took in history.  The authors chart this progress from events immediately prior to the Japanese invasions of 1941-2, depicting a region at the crossroads of change.  On the surface, British rule continued in the routines of rule that had existed for decades, with colonists engaged in their intricate social rituals at the top of a racially stratified society.  Yet beneath these placid assumptions, a growing nationalism was beginning to erode the sureties of the British presence.  Bayly and Harper's coverage of this is one of the many strengths of the book, as they describe the numerous racial groups and the complicated politics of their interactions with impressive breadth and confidence.  Japan sought to exploit this nationalist sentiment by posturing as liberators seeking to create an "Asia for the Asians."  Yet the success of their conquest was due more to British weakness than the success of any Japanese appeal.  Stunned by the rapidity of the Japanese advance, British forces collapsed in a matter of weeks, irreparably damaging the imperial prestige upon which much of their rule rested.  Racial attitudes only exacerbated tensions, as white colonials often "pulled rank" in their eagerness to escape the Japanese onslaught.  The memory of this would color relations in the region for years after the war.  Though the Japanese advanced as far as northern Burma, overstretched supply lines and the annual monsoons brought an end to their offensive in the region.  Yet with their forces shattered and their resources strained, initially the British could do little to dislodge them.  Here the authors turn their attention to the suffering brought about by war, particularly a devastating famine in India, the result of wartime disruption, a devastating cyclone, and British misgovernment.  With tensions high and many leaders of the Indian National Congress in prison, the Japanese tried to take advantage of the situation by sponsoring an Indian independence movement under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose.  Yet this effort, like those in Burma and Malaya, soon fell victim to the brutality and abuse of Japanese rule, which alienated the native populations and fueled resistance throughout the region.  With the failure of their U-Go offensive in the spring of 1944, the end of Japanese rule was increasingly apparent to the peoples of the region.  Yet even as the British prepared to reassert imperial rule, their former subjects were positioning themselves for independence.  Here the authors illustrate both how much the experience of war had changed the region and how blind the British were to these changes.  For all of the insincerity of Japanese motivations, the rhetoric of independence and the creation of local military forces had fanned nationalist hopes and accelerated what ultimately became an irreversible end to the British Empire in Asia.  Bayly and Harper have provided an excellent history of the war in southeastern Asia and its role in decolonization.  The breadth of their coverage is impressive, particularly in their examination of Asian perspectives towards both British and Japanese rule - something all too often absent in histories of the conflict.  Though the narrative often suffers from stilted writing, the insightful analysis the authors offer more than compensates for the lack of polish in the prose.  In fact, the abrupt termination of their account with the end of the fighting left me hoping for a follow-up volume that tracks these developments to their eventual conclusion - independence and the creation of a new Asia 
 I just watched the first half of this tonite.  I had a basic beat going in no time.  Then some accents, too.  Yeah, maybe it is basic, but I tried a bit before this tape & it (timing) never really came together.  Ed starts slow enough for you to follow, and you can watch it and play with the camera angles set just right.  The band swings, and they are fun to play with after each lesson as well.  If you want to get going on brushes, this is a must 
 I found this book on a shelf at a library over 10 years ago. It was a hardcover book and the artwork was rather nondescript. What I browsed through within though is seared into my conscience and really opened my eyes to the world of female lust thought. I admit, NOTHING has ever aroused me like some of the entries inside - even hardcore [...]. It's all about intent, motive, desire. Is it real? Is it sincere? You could put the most flat out gorgeous woman in front of me and she might not have anywhere near the erotic intensity of a woman who society might deem "less than perfect" looks-wise. It almost always is the look in her eye, or the pitch of her voice, something that conveys warmth, you know? More than anything, seeing and feeling a palpable HUNGER, an aching so deep it hurts for satisfaction. I found a lot of that energy in this book and it was DIVINE. I wish Ms. Friday would release another compilation of this material 
 The latest in my reading of Hiaasen's back list, this one was funny and page turning.  The main character is instantly likable and Hiaasen creates tension in this plot, almost as if it was a straight mystery thriller with murder, thugs, cops, killers and crooked judges.  However Hiaasen doesn't write straight forward novels (although I'm quite sure he could) he writes on the edge of outrageousness with a unique blend of dark humor and wit.  If you haven't tried out this author yet, this is a good place to give him a try, if you like this one, you'll want to try others and if this doesn't suit, oh well, you're missing out.      
 This book was excellent, entertaining, a fast read and an all-around great escape. Was is 100% believable?  No, of course not.  It's a novel.  Nevertheless I rate it as one of the most entertaning books I've read in a while 
 Released in the 90s, this album I bought on vinyl,being a fan of late 70s rockers the Dictators.At the time could not really understand why they did not use the Dictators name, but that has now been rectified.The album is very good, catchy rock tunes, and the band are very underrated.

 "A Linguistic Key To The Greek New Testament,"  by Rienecker has been a tremendous help to me as a pastor in the study of the New Testament.  One of its values in in its ease of use - important words are listed in the order they appear in the text.  More importantly, the definitions are very scholarly,accurate and objective, reflecting very little, if any, of the author's prejudices.  I have recommended this book to many scholars over the years 
 This book is one of the best general physics texts there is. Period. The author(s) took the time to clearly explain topics and answer all those little "Wait, why did you do this?" questions that other texts leave to you to figure out. I still go back to this book instead of Hibbeler's engineering series as the concepts are explained much more clearly and the excersizes are tough to make sure you really learn the concepts. Another great feature of this book is it's easy to understand writting style. Reading the book is just like having a professer explain something to you in person, not a mathenatician reading a theorem out loud, unlike say, Hibbeler. Very good choice overall 
 At one time, no home in America was complete without an Almanac. While that tradition has faded, the book that started it all--The Old Farmer's Almanac--remains a useful and interesting resource; one that no home should be without. The Old Farmer's Almanac features everything that makes an Almanac an Almanac, including its sunrise and sunset times, tide tables, and weather predictions for the entire year (and most of the time I've found them to be right on!). Amongst these essential facts, there are an abundance of entertaining stories that range from the historical and scientific to home and garden tips and amusing antedotes. This book just offers so much and I know that once you pick up, you'll be hooked. I've always found something of interest in The Old Farmer's Almanac and can't wait because the new edition comes out in September 
 Mae Belle, Mitch, and cast.  This is a GREAT read.  Mae Belle is an orphan (well past the age of consent) that was raised by her three Uncles - who are as different as different can be - and who all lived in separate houses. She is worried about caring for her late Uncle's Butler and Housekeeper - who are more like parents to Mae rather than servants, and the dog (another great dog character).  Mitch is a stock-broker going through a small mid-life crisis. He always wanted to be a PI and finally took his chance on a bet. He meets Mae Belle (whom he calls Mabel to annoy her) during the last week of his bet. Her retainer wins him the bet.  My favorite scene is where Mae calls Mitch and tells him to come over. He is so excited that he tries to exit his apartment lacking clothing. (He got the call right as he got out of the shower.) Luckily, his friend shows up and makes sure that he is dressed before he leaves (in shoes, no socks, a suit jacket, and pants). As they are driving to Mae Belle's his friend doesn't grasp the urgent nature of Mitch's flight to Mae Belle's side. Mitch says, "She asked me to come over. Now." His friend finally catches on, and gets Mitch there in one piece.  The story is fun, fast-paced, rich with supporting characters, and well worth the read. 
 I don't normally read sci-fi but I was curious to see what George Martin would do.  I was pleasantly surprised, especially after the disappointment of "A Feast for Crows."  Tuf is an amusing character and the book has a touch of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" to it.  Well done. 
 Very informative when planning our trip to Ireland.  Will be using this for our stays throughout Ireland 
 This is an excellent resource book for anyone interested in kiln formed glass.....very clear with great illustrations. Well worth the $$$!! 
 If Thomas Frank wondered in his book "What's The Matter With Kansas?" why a formerly populist state such as Kansas became a red state, he may also be wondering why a red state such as North Dakota could elect a populist like Byron Dorgan for six terms to the House and three terms to the Senate.  It could very well be that, aside from being a skilled debater, he has a talent for stating the issues clearly and forcefully.  In his latest book, he takes on the Washington consensus on "free trade."  When asked why populists such as himself have been losing in their fight for fair trade, he replies that "the other side has stolen the language." (This is the same argument George Lakoff makes in "Whose Freedom.")  Dorgan argues that the free trade pacts are neither free nor fair; they were written by corporate lobbyists who write into them many protections for their corporate clients and none for ordinary citizens.  Many Democrats have also signed onto these trade pacts, not only for fear of being labelled anti-business or protectionist, but because these corporations provide large campaign contributions.  No country practices free trade - the US included.  Every country has some form of managed trade.  Conservatives, of course, cannot argue for managed trade, not only for ideological reasons, but for their cynicism of governments ability to do the job.  For this reason free trade has not been working.  Free trade, as it is practised today means corporations can transfer capital and technology anywhere in the world, employ cheap labor to build their products and ship them back to the US.  This is greatly contributing to the $700 to $800 billion annual trade deficit and it is decimating our labor force.  With these trade figures one would become cynical about leaving management of the world economy to multinational corporations.  For all his populist sloganeering about corporate greed, Dorgan understands that multinationals are politically neutral and designed to maximize profits.  It is for the "brain-dead politics" that he vents most of his anger.  Dorgan argues that it is up to the US government to create free and fair trade policies that will raise labor and environmental standards worldwide.  Instead of having the American worker compete with foreign workers who are paid $.50 an hour, we should be raising the bar for countries and our own corporations who are exporting to the US.    Dorgan has a long list of policy recommendations designed to reverse the trade deficit: some of which are reasonable and others which are futile.  We need a fair trade plan (as opposed to the current auto pilot); we need to look at the idea of import certificates (suggested by Warren Buffet); we need to design a tax system to keep American jobs from going offshore; and we need to consolidate the 17 agencies dealing with trade into one.  The futile includes having Congress set ever higher ceilings on trade deficits, which is what they do for the national debt, and which serves no useful purpose.  Dorgan is correct that action must be taken, another decade of the current deficits will force us to sell off large pieces of our wealth - the American worker included - and it will create a vicious circle of downward pressure on our standard of living.  Conservative and neoliberal critics are a bit naive if they think the invisible hand will magically rectify the current imbalances because other countries have created export oriented economies that are designed to habitually run surpluses.  As more people become disenchanted with gobalization in its current form, Dorgan will be sure to gain a wider audience 
 Being a longtime devotee of Saint Francis, I have read at least 10 biographies and seen the three most famous films about him.  Francis of Assisi (1961) is a good introductory film, while Brother Sun Sister Moon (1973) was an adequate retelling of the story.  In my mind, however, Francesco is the most historically accurate of the three.  There is little of Hollywood or Flower Power in here.  Francesco's struggles and rough faith journey is well presented.  The names used for the main characters is in the old Italian, with Chiara used instead of Claire, Leoni instead of Leo, among others. Good points: Vangelis' masterful score lends a tangible atmosphere of spiritual struggle.  Helena Bonham Carter's Portayal of St. Claire, or Chiara, was insipiring and memorable.  I named my daughter Chiara as a result.  The supporting characters, especially Pietro Catani and Leoni, were magnificent. Bad points: Unfortunately, this movie couldn't be perfect.  The one fly in the ointment for me was Mickey Rourke.  At times, especially in scenes involving lepers, he truly captures the character of the saint.  Most of the time, however, he just seems to me to be rattling off memorized lines. Another point worth noting is that the miraculous events of Francis' life were minimized.  No talking crucifixes or any of that here.  Only the stigmata.  But what an impact that scene makes! I've seen two versions of this movie.  One was from a Japanese laserdisc and another was the VHS version.  It appears that scenes were rearranged for the VHS version, and I suppose that this accounts for the "disjointedness" that many other reviews mention.  The Japanese laserdisc version I saw had a much more coherent scene arrangement. Still, I give this 5 stars 
 My taste in gold has gone from yellow to white and when I found these online I was happy with the price. When they arrived they were beautiful and I wear them now almost everyday.  Gave my yellow gold pair to my daughter!   
 "Dreaming in Cuban" was beautifully written from the point of view of various members of the same family. The story is told through the eyes of different generations of women (and occasionally their men), each with fascinatingly different outlooks. I found the story compelling, and I was unable to put down the book until I finished it.   Not only was there a glimpse of the political situation in Cuba, there was also a description of the relationships between mothers and their daughters, the way that the women interact with each other and with the world around them.   Although I typically find letters thrown into a novel to tell parts of the story confusing and distracting, here the letters written by Ceila to her ex-lover provide a beautiful complement to the flow of the tale.   I strongly recommend this book to anyone who has an appreciation for an interesting method of storytelling. The way that the book jumps around between times and characters may be confusing for some, but I found it only added to my overall enjoyment 
 Made only twelve years after the end of World War I, this 1930 epic is the first of its kind in the sound era, and, arguably, remains the greatest war movie ever made. Filmed at Universal Pictures and on location on a California ranch, its production cost a staggering $1.25 million and employed over 2,000 extras. The Library of Congress has done an outstanding job of film restoration in bringing the movie to DVD. The story is viewed from the perspective of German soldiers, former students enlist for the glory of the Fatherland then are thrown into the daily life of trench warfare, where nothing but misery, more misery and ultimately death awaits. We get to know this goup of students-turned-soldiers and watch them fall away over the course of the film. The grainy black and white photography of Arthur Edeson has a very modern look; the film feels recent. The battle sequences are amazing, epecially in view of the film's age, as one army's ill-fated attack follows a similar attack by the other. France and Germany, each tearing-up the best of its young men in futile conflict across a virtual moonscape of crators covering "no man's land" captured by director Lewis Milestone's knowing eye. I'd wager Stanley Kubrick watched this movie a thousand times before making "Paths Of Glory," as there is much from Milestone's film borrowed by him twenty-seven years later.   The sounds of battle engulf us; the rattle of heavy machine gun fire, smaller arms exchanges, handgrenades, and the deadly explosions from days of artillerty bombardments.  There is much dying and death in this film. While very little blood is shown, the combat scenes are still horrific. The senselessness of it all is on display here, an anti-war war film by default, director Milestone and the cast and crew created a filmic monument to both man's stupidity and nobility.       
 I've only been on the diet for the two week period, but already I can see changes, I did't lose right away but magicilly the lbs started to melt  away, I have tried about every diet, every weight lose program out there  and alway gain back the wieght and then some, I am not giving up because I  already see progress, it's easy and most important it's a livable program  you can do the rest of you natural life,, thanks so much,, on side effect I  was having was a headache, but I drank lots of coffee,but dropping the  coffee I think I was caffiene withdrawls, so if I had a sip or two of  coffee the headache went away now down to 3 cups but not all at once, 
 After reading The Illuminatus! Trilogy, I stared at my copy of Schroedinger's Cat and wondered how the hell Bob could top the 800-page work of lunacy he had created with Robert Shea.  Of course, I shouldn't have doubted Bob; anyone who has read his books knows how he can construct the most meaningful anecdotes and stories from seemingly random and uninteresting information.  This book is no different.  When I started reading this book, I assumed that the story would have to do with Schroedinger's Cat (obviously), but I didn't understand the novel's structure until I reached page 80 and the book ended, only to start again in a different world (which I know sounds strange; read it if you want to understand).  The plot of this novel seems entirely random, and up to a certain point it is, but it has more structure than would seem at first glance.  Like Illuminatus!, it would require a great deal of analysis and scholarship to unravel the ever-knotted threads of Schroedinger's Cat, and I know few who have the time to do that.  Still, it's quite an enjoyable read, even if you never know fully what the hell is going on.  As is usual for Robert Anton Wilson books, Schroedinger's Cat is side-splittingly funny.  Perhaps the funniest part of the book is how characters change from world to world.  For instance, in one world, Epicene Wildeblood is a debonair ladies' man.  In a different world, Epicene is now a she, Mary Margaret Wildeblood, after a sex change.  Even historical figures in the novel change depending on the world.  James Joyce, in one world, was a minor composer.  In another, Ezra Pound was not a famous poet; he was a famous folksinger.  In yet another, Aleister Crowley was not an infamous occultist, but instead a British general who was the first person to reach the North Pole, which he claimed was inhabited by little green people when he got there (if you laugh at that, you will appreciate the book's humor).  It's hard to put together a review of this book, because there's no continuous plot (at least not in the ordinary sense).   Characters disappear for (sometimes literally) hundreds of pages, then reappear as if nothing happened.  It's very disorienting and why I waited several months after reading the book to actually review it.  I thought that "sitting on my thoughts," allowing them to formulate, would help.  Instead, I find that I've forgotten half of what went on in the book.  Oh, memory, how thou hast robbed me!  Anyway, before I start to ramble, let me say that this is a good book  for all science-fiction fans to read, since it is actual SCIENCE fiction (i.e. it involves quite complicated issues of quantum mechanics).  I would recommend it to anyone with an IQ of 250 or a Ph.D. in rocket science.   If you're like me and have neither, it's still a great novel.  It just won't make full sense until you understand Bob's philosophy of neurological model agnosticism and quantum mechanics.

 I know, I know, really corny! Stumbled, is the word I'll use for finding out about Teena Marie. Sure I knew of the rockin' hit "Lovergirl" but I guess my navie self never thought to devulge deeper into Teena's music. So I did a little research, downloaded some tunes and I am now a fan of Teena Marie. I know this is the "Epic Era" Greatest Hits but The Ultimate Collection didn't hit on some of the songs I really dug that were on this album, such as "Out On A Limb" which I have to say is a beautiful song! Very sensual and pleading and worth one star alone. "Work It" is another one of my fave "T" songs. It's jazzy feel just flows and the lyrics are so damn catchy! "Ooh, La, La, La" is sweet and has a that Teena touch. And we all know "Lovergirl" so why should I waste time describing this excellent song? I thought this was missing the driving "Lips To Find You" which has the tightest beat of any Teena song and the coolest bassline ever. Personally this album whould have been better if it did include the "Motown Era" hits such as one of my faves "Square Biz" (I love that whole rapping thing that Teena did) and "Behind The Groove" which has another sharp bass line but I know that these are two separate great hits compliations. If you want to get into some Teena I suggest you listen to the songs I listed above and also "I Need Your Lovin", "Alladin's Lamp", "It Must Be Magic", the Rick James duets-"Fire & Desire" etc. Trust me you will be hooked by now.  Teena is one of those artists (like Madonna) who reinvents herself, she went from disco to the 80's dance to heavy metal to jazz and still maintains a solid audience. If you don't know Lady T, get to know her, because her music moves your feet and your soul and you will not want to stop listening to her 
 Some of the scens really make me laugh! One that you can watch several times and it's still funny. 
 The phone was simple to install and is light weight.  Even though the phone is made of plastic, it looks authentic (metal).  The sound quality is good, but not great.  If you are looking for a functional phone with an historical look at an affordable price, this is your phone.

 This was a reread for me. The reason why this is my favorite McCarthy book is because it has absoloutely everything. Chicago heiress, Amanda Delmar, came to Cuttersville Ohio to get her dad's attention (read: A Date With the Other Side).  Her plan backfired and her father ended up cutting her off financially.  So she is stuck in a haunted house with $50 to her name and zero job skills. Danny Tucker works on his family farm.  Danny and Amanda are physically attracted to each other, but neither thinks the other could possibly want the other.  What could an heiress see in a farmer?  What could a farmer see in a spoiled heiress? Danny finds out he has an 8 year old daughter, Piper.  Piper is the heart and soul of this book.  She comes to Danny's farm with some issues.  It'll make you weepy to find out all about Piper.  But it will also warm your heart to see how everyone embraces this little girl. Danny hires Amanda to babysit Piper and do a little house cleaning. Amanda is witty and funny.  She is much more than a spoiled heiress.  She is also sensitive, love starved and lonely. It is an amazing book.  It's a beautiful story, watching Danny, Piper and Amanda fall in love with eachother, heal eachother.   This is a heartwarming tale written with style, humor, sensitivity and such clarity you really feel what the characters feel. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and in the end you'll smile 
 I am a parent of two homeschooled teenagers and highly recommend this book not only for teens but for others who are still searching for their "niche" in life.  The author gives very practical ideas on  helping make decisions about their vocation and does not automatically  assume that college is the way to get there 
 Essays by Barzun from the 1940s to the 1970s on such topics as writer's block and the discipline required to write, the fine art of translation, the ubiquity of poor writing, and the book publishing business.  Superbly  written.  Most of these essays are still entirely true and eye-opening 
 THE MOONSTONE is Collins's most compulsively readable and pleasurable novel. It was phenomenally popular, and it boosted the circulation of ALL THE YEAR ROUND. It is also his most conceptually complex work. As a prototypical detective novel, THE MOONSTONE has attracted a host of psychoanalitic readings, which have stressed the novel's cognitive ambiguity - the way that it continually asserts and undermines the sources of its own coherence, most notably by breaking down the boundary between "objective" and "subjective" reality, so that it becomes a palimpsest of overt and covert meanings. As a study in ambiguity itself, the novel becomes Collins's most ambitious exploration of social and psychic identity.  Mid-nineteenth-century debates about consciousness signalled the tenousness of a knowable subjectivity fixed through clear disruptive boundaries in the very drive to establish that subjectivity. THE MOONSTONE continually exploits the tenousness of these boundaries by juggling with these distinct hypotheses, and it is this that shapes its possible subversive ideological meanings. The undermining of the boundaries betwen homely and uncanny, inside and outside, normal and deviant, are homologous wiht the function of the boundaries between the "rational" and "occult" on the one hand, between "Englishness" and "foreigness" on the other, a process which culminates, through metaphoric transference and analogy, in a direct correspondence between the social construction of psychic marginality, adn the process whereby colonial "otherness! works as the projection of "English" fascination and fears.   THE MOONSTONE is a novel about remembering, but it also is a novel about forgetting, about what is intractable, about silence, suppression and concealment. This is a basic precondition of the story: there would have been no mystery if Rachel had not suppressed her knowledge of the theft. The pleasure of the "discovery of the truth" thus depends on the interplay between conscious and unconscious forms of resistance involved in the "loss of the diamond".   The Prologue tells the story of the Verinder's family guilty past of colonial expropriation. Yet the history of the diamond remains "unconscious". The novel is concerned with the journey from the darkness to the light. The reader, like the sceptical observers Bruff and Betteredge, is drawn into the "secret theatre" of the action. The mainstream physiologist William B. Carpenter had claimed in 1847, following Pritchard and anticipating Maudsley, that individuals could not be held responsible for actions that they had performed reflexively, or automatically: "Nor can we say a human action is wrong... when it directly results from a powerful impulse which he has no power to restrain." ("Dr Mayo on the relations of crime, insanity and punishment.") Opium provides the explicit means of inducing a trance-like state in which "volitional activity" is suspended, and Ezra Jennings operates as Blake's "unconscious", the site of Blake's painful intractable memories.   The function of the diamond in the novel resists any clear distinction between its metaphoric and metonymic meanings. It operates as the signifier of the meanings that are projected onto it. It is thus that the diamond itself represents the workings of the "hidden soul". As such, it is set against that other image of the magnetic yellow deeps - the Shivering Sand.  Blake remains healthy because he continually becomes dissociated from the past or any fixed identity. He is a palimpsest of national identities, yet this is not ultimately incompatible with his Englishness. 
 I must say that while this is an amazing book, it is written in the guise of being a guide to the future of humanity. How can this possibly be done by studying the history, as we are constantly shown that the future is impossible to predict and more often than not history does not repeat itself. What should be shown is that people are unpredictable as the future and that the content of the book is simply as the title implies 
 I'll tell you how good I found this book: I've read it so many times, it's falling apart. I'm about to get a new copy. This book is laugh-out-loud-til-you-cry funny 
 My mother borrowed this book and still has it. She refers to it regularly. I finally had to buy another copy for myself. The directions are very easy to follow and the pictures are clear.  Each chapter is a different technique taught by an expert.  Just reading through it gets you excited about trying some of the projects. 
 I like this album because it's a fun album. Not trying to dig at other reviewer's, but sometimes reading words like 'masterpiece' doesn't make an album very exciting, at least that's my personal viewpoint. This is a fun album from Supertramp that has a bouncy quality. There are some good textures and Roger Hodgson's vocals are particularly high-pitched on this outing. The songs are generally shorter than what would be found on the previous albums. Good albu, 4.0/5.

 James Branch Cabell was once the most celebrated figure of American literature. He was the favourite author of Mark Twain, and was also praised by other renowned writers, including Sinclair Lewis. This book, Jurgen, is among Cabell's very finest (all his work is fine), a book that was long closest to Cabell's heart, and the one that has the centre of his philosophy, the eternal search for Beauty, his one Ideal, as the main subject matter.  Jurgen is the place to start. And after Jurgen, I would go back to Figures of Earth, of which happenings actually precede those of Jurgen, and then on to The Silver Stallion. Other great ones by Cabell: The King Was in His Counting House, Smirt, Smith, and Smire

 Two days ago I began to read "Escape from Slavery". I have hardly wanted to set it down since I picked it up. I have been saddened but incredibly inspired. I am forcefully reminded that freedom is a miracle too easily taken for granted. Until this week, I admit I was completely ignorant of Sudan, let alone the plight of it's people. In fact, I only knew Sudan was another big country "somewhere in Africa". This book is not a history of Sudan, but it does put it on the map for you. It does not try to expound on all of the political issues, but it paints a very human picture of how the government affects the people. This is one young man's compelling account of his early life and journey as a slave in Sudan. It is told in a simple, clear and honest voice. For me, Sudan is now the birthplace of Piol Bol Buk - known today as "Francis Bok". It is the place where Piol laughed and played with his family. He made clay cows with his friends, and dreamed of being like his father. It is the place where Piol was entrusted one day to take his mother's produce to sell at the market...and would never return. Here was a little boy forced to witness unspeakable violence, and who had everything taken away from him. However, no one could take his indomitable spirit. Sudan is a place where innocent lives are crushed every day, and yet it is also the place where Francis Bok was created. Francis humbly and painstakingly details his escape, the agonizing immigration process, and the miraculous turn of events that ensued. Francis has begun to fulfill his father's prophesy that someday he would do "great and important things" and would have the strength of "twelve men". This is a story about slavery, but it is really a story about hope, faith, will-power and determination. It is a miraculous story. Who could have imagined that this young boy with no hope of survival would make such a huge impact for his country already? Truly inspirational! This is a testament that the human spirit can survive unspeakable things - and then can rise from the ashes. When you find a story like this, you just can't wait to share it with the world! Francis Bok lived through such horrific pain, and yet now we have the chance to listen to his story, and to make a difference in the world just like he has. I hope that you will choose to read this story. I know that you will be so grateful 
 After reading some very amusing reviews about Fear Of The Dark On Amazon, my friend and I being avid horror movie fans of B and grade A alike decided to buy it. Safe to say it wasn't as bad as some people made it out to be, it does have a few downfalls but it's PG-13 so give it a break, has a good but not solid story and a likable cast of characters.The younger brother Ryan is pretty much the hero of the story, scared as hell of the dark (and the things in it) and we for one thought the little boy not only ruled but he was probably the most realistic, some of the chemistry between the actors kind of flogs a little bit. There's a typical love story of boy really likes girl and the like, amusing enough Dale probably has more chemistry with his mother then the girl he likes while the little brother should seriously hold onto that phone number because those two actors probably had the best chemistry on screen.Dale seems to only honestly have chemistry between Ryan and himself, quite lovable for little brother and big brother, during scenes with Dale's own parents we got the feeling he was more like a babysitter then their son, and with the girl the crushing was believable but it was overall typical. (Could have done without Dale smoking, it showed up no where else in the movie but at least he tells Ryan it's bad for your health.)The Female lead is actually a first for us to like, she's believable and definately the heroine, she's not your typical airhead and overall we were rooting for her instead of hoping she got crushed by a ladder or something, while the little brother is definately more the hero, watching it will make you root and yell at the screen telling the characters to believe the poor kid. The parents are also likable, despite their little screen time and I found myself kind of wanting to see them in the film more.The monsters of the movie were pretty freaky long as you couldn't see them entirely, that was the downfall, the things in the dark really should have been kept half hidden till near the end of the movie. We watched it first in the daytime, which surprisingly made us jump at a few scenes and it was a little freakier in the  night.Touching on things we even do as we get older, keeping all our limbs under the covers, throwing blankets over our heads, heck I still throw pillows over my head even when the lights on and look into the hallways to make sure nothings there. Giving it a second round was probably for the best, during the first round we didn't get a few things until the second.For example, you kind of wonder what is the point of the female lead and the stories she's telling, it's kind of like 'Is she only there for a plot ploy of love interest for teenage girl appeal?' well we came to understand exactly what it was, pay attention to the little boy who goes in the basement and then it comes together. She lends more to the film then it looks, it's just stuble. I would have liked to see the female lead with  her little brother more too in flashbacks, it's best to pay attention and understand her dialouge...man the movie had more potential really.The storyline is good but probably not solid enough, it could have used a full two hours instead of eighty four minutes well as strange stories surrounding missing children, and the town being kind of haunted by them, Ryan seeing a therapist once or twice for a full effect but the story does well on it's own.One thing We'd like to see in a Evil Dead remake considering they are doing one and it was on the television in the movie (That gave it brownieee points!) is Kevin Zegers as the next Ash baby, he's doing so many horror movies and he's a good actor, he really should try for the role of Ash, he's even got the face for it. Yeah random, but I couldn't help but saying it. Overall, the movie is fun and cool enough to watch with your little siblings and bestmates, has a little spook and some laughs, keeps a realm of suspense, very little cursing, but don't expect hightime horror and gore. It's worth ten bucks for a horror fan or just someone who likes a little spook and smiles, just make sure to watch it in the dark for full effect and some cuddling wouldn't hurt. = 
 Beverly's book has been the catalyst for me to begin loving myself.  I have had the opportunity to put into practice the suggestions that she makes in her book and I can happily say that they work!  I find that it  really is o.k. to love me first; to take care of myself; and the rest of my  life is falling into place the way that I have wanted it to for so many  years.  I hope that everyone who has had a problem in relationships will  read this book because it can only enhance the positive.  Thank you to  Beverly for all of her years of study and her gift of being able to  communicate that knowledge to others through her books.  Enjoy 
 My students LOVE this book. They refer to it regularly. The flow charts and diagrams are invaluable. The systematic diagrams help students visualize how various networks components work individually and as a group. This is a great beginning network book as well as a reference tool. The chapters are short and to the point. Reproducing the diagrams without the text allows assessment of student understanding 
 a hard-hitting story that packs a punch, t davis bunn certainly delivers in this fast-paced political thrille 
 Absolutely a gem no doubt about it. You will not go wrong with this cd 
 I'm usually more of a fiction reader, but this was a page turner. My own grandfather fought in the battle of the bulge and I found the story filled in a lot of holes in my understanding of the historic battle. A very heroic tale, sad and yet triumphant, I couldn't put it down.   The only fault I could possibly find with it is the authors repeated attempts to drive home how heroic everything was. Yes, it was an amazing and heroic effort by a platoon outnumbered at times 20 to 1, but he could have stopped trying to build this up in the readers minds. I think we get it. These men did something amazing 
 This is a great book by Bourdain. His personality and sense of humour shine through!! Great recipes that most people can repeat, with easy to find ingredients....and really emphasizes organization in the kitchen...your "meez" 
                 An audio recording of Patrick Stewart's one-man rendition of Charles Dicken's Timeless Classic. Stewart has adapted the text for his show and performs all the characters and necessary sound effects. It is wonderful example of the power of a good actor.  The enduring story of "A Christmas Carol" involves Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy grasping businessman, who is untouched by human emotion. Or so we think until he is visited one Christmas Eve by four sprits who show him the error of his ways. In the end a redeemed Scrooge resolves to keep the Christmas spirit all the days of his life and to be good to his fellow men.  Stewart is able without the aid of costumes, scenery, special effects, or other actors, to bring this timeless tale to life. His vivid characterization of each person is all the more remarkable for the fact that the only tools he has are his voice and the listener's imagination.  I enjoy his rendition more and more each passing year. 
 This book is a classic.  If you own only two or three film books, this should be one of them.  Everson was the man.  He saw everything, and what's more, he understood what he saw.  There is no better introduction to the  world of silent film 
 This is a book that would be enjoyed and appreciated by any one that owns, shows or breeds a Shih Tzu.  It would also be excellent for someone who does not know the breed and wants to learn more about it.  The  illustrations are beautiful and you know that this book has been written by  someone who is very well informed about the Shih Tzu breed and also loves  them very much 
 Having just finalised an e-business thesis on Online Personalization, I must say that this book is an impressive source on the strategic level for what is synonymously called CRM, One-to-One marketing, relationship marketing, etc.   What I like about Peppers & Rogers is that they don't pretend to be the only ones to have seen this shift in customer-focused organizations (although they were first-movers in US by coining the term One-to-One in 1993). Peppers & Rogers accept readily that many other people have interesting perspectives to add. Thus, this book includes many contributions from marketing wizards like Philip Kotler, Seth Godin, Bruce Kasanoff, and Patricia Seybold.  The book is the sixth from the authors. If you have read some of the previous publications, you'll already be familiar with their core concepts like the IDIC-model (Identify-Differentiate-Interact-Customize), as well as Learning Relationships and customer Lifetime Value.   I believe that Peppers & Rogers' most important contribution is to change a company's focus from customer acquisition to customer retention. That is: Stop spending all you money getting new customers and start spending more on keeping and growing existing customers. This is where the learning relationships come in. The basic idea of Managing Customer Relationships, the authors concisely describe in plain English:  The Learning Relationships work like this: If you're my customer and I get you to talk to me, and I remember what you tell me, then I get smarter and smarter about you. I know something about you my competitors don't know. So I can do things for you my competitors can't do, because they don't know you as well as I do. Before long, you can get something from me you can't get anywhere else, for any price. At the very least, you'd have to start all over somewhere else, but starting over is more costly than staying with me.  Being a Dane, I'm proud to see the reference made on page 172 that the relationship theory can be traced back to the Scandinavian School of Relationships Management (e.g. Gronroos and Gummeson). Back in the 1980's, both were required reading in Scandinavian business schools. They often researched service firms and B2B-networks and based on this knowledge, they emphasised the contents and types of the business relationships and the required strategies to make these relationships work. It wasn't until the 1990's that CRM-initiatives took off in the United States - and usually they have been very technology-driven. Today, we all accept that you need both the relationship mindset and the technology-enabler. So the two approaches may ultimately achieve the same goals.

 Whenever I have thought about investing in real estate, I always dismissed it as a "no, that's not for me."  I had seen the various folks on TV saying `buy my papers so you can learn the tricks to purchasing homes for pennies on the dollar with no money down' but I never felt like I could spend the money on their product. Then, after searching through this book by way of the Search Inside and reading a page here and there, I knew I had to purchase it. The information it contained was worth much more than the cost I paid to purchase it.  The book spends a lot of time on understanding the various financial nuances of purchasing real estate.  It has various worksheets throughout it to help even the most mathematically challenged person (like me) understand some very complex concepts like interest, mortgage payments, returns on investment and even landlord/tenant agreements.  Further, the book offers a basic business plan and guidelines for setting up your own operation.  The book is full of information and offers an accessible look at the world of real estate investment.  It acknowledges that the complexity of real estate while keeping the text easy-to-understand and interesting.  The step-by-step approach the book takes makes it an excellent resource for an investment beginner like me.  I'm sure that a more seasoned investor would also find useful information in the book as well.  I'm confident the small investment price I paid for the book will multiply exponentially as I put the information into action and start my own investment program.

 This early book by Yoder is an ecellent treatment of biblical politics.  Yoder examines the nature of discipleship, showign how it is the Christian's form of political action in the world.  He goes on to examine the biblical teaching on the church and state as distinct political entities.    One of the very helpful contributions of this book is how it shows the depth of Yoder's theology of the state.  Many will caracaturize the anabaptist postition as being "sectarian" and advocating the isolation of the Christian from the world. Yoder's understanding of the state has a profound depth to it that is thoroughly informed by the biblcal narrative.  He shows clearly how God uses both church and state prvodentially in his ordering of human life.  The chruch deals with violence through reconcilliation, the state through counter-violence.  Yoder is clear that the politics of the state are contrary to the kingdom of God, despite God's providential ordering of them to his ultimate purposes.  Thus the true politics are those of the church.  Thus, discipleship, active commitment to the lordship of Christ in all of life is the proper Christian way of politics.  While this book is early in the work of Yoder, there is much here that is worthy of attention.  Yoder's position is nunaced, biblical and vital.  Highly recommended 
 I love Greg Iles! Have been a fan since Spandau Phoenix - Mortal Fear is Iles' second offering and it is one of my all time favorite books. It deals with computer technology and a computer sex site - and a killer who is using it for his prey. The use of character developement is astounding and the tension is nonstop. For those who like Iles, and haven't read his earlier works, this is really a must read - if you are a fan of this genre and have missed this one - you will be thrilled 
 An annually updated resource, the Empire State Railway Museum's Tourist Trains 2003 is an exhaustive resource which is especially recommended for those tourists and travelers who happen to also be railroading fans. The 38th annual guide to tourist railroads and museums presenting more than 500 railroad-related attractions to visit (including ones that offer train rides, with open hours, fees, coupons good for discounts, and much, much more), Tourist Trains 2003 is commended as being an excellent, information-packed guide filled from cover to cover with fun railroading activities that the whole family can enjoy 
 Beautiful Adagios and a rich selection for the price. Audio travels to Vienna, London, Cambridge et 
 My mom died a year ago. I read many books in an attempt to understand and cope with my feelings. This book stood out as the very best. I read and reread it and even read it a year later. I have given it to several friends going through their own loss of parents and all have given it high marks.  The best thing about the book is its first person nature. You are not reading about others that have grieved...you read about his grief, his regret, his failings as a son and eventually his reconciliation with himself. When I read he was a psychologist I was somewhat wary--they can be removed and analystical-- but this book is the opposite. I have read the other highly rated books on this site--all of them--and this one still sticks in my memory where the others are long forgotten. 
 I disagree with the former reviewer that this is not a wise purchase. These texts are available online if you know how to find them, so part of buying a book these days is the having of a crafted object upon which to enjoy that text. In this regard, this 100 page book has the title nicely embossed into it's paper cover and its art is simple, classic. The paper inside is an off white that has obviously been carefully chosen. Best of all, the type is very crisp and clear and easy to read. When I buy a book I am most concerned with the quality of the type because, in my opinion, muddy text is distracting.   I would agree that it is not a definitive reference, but I enjoy soaking in a few gems from many writers on many subjects, and for this reason I am glad that these little great ideas books are being published.  I have not seen the other volume that was aforementioned by the previous reviewer and therefore cannot compare its qualities 
 I found this book to be exceptionally laid out and detailed, helping me keep on top of what I need to be doing to be the best during my pregnancy.  I am a high risk mother to be, and appreciate being aware and organized, and feel it benefits my baby and my body.  I truly recommend this as another tool to help throughout this wonderful experience 
 This book offered a wonderful protrail of the classic by alfred noyes. The pictures within 'the highwayman' are great, they have been wonderfuly drawn by Charles Keeping to portray the fantasic poem that has won the hearts of so many 
 This book has all different ways to use pockets as a teaching tool, but I like the extra suggestions and so-called extended activities, too. There are ways to pull out the book to use with math and language lessons, not just when I'm doing my special pocket unit, which is one of the most popular for my 4 and 5 year olds. This author has excellent ideas for language development, especially in helping kids to speak in sentences instead of just phrases. It's a bargain at any price 
 This book contains easy to understand information for all fitness levels. The running program in particular is well devised and delivers what it promises. All of the information is useful and current,its like having a years subcription to a fitness magazine rolled into the one book. Excellent product 
 I've purchased this book for my daughter who is almost 9 years old, I end up reading it before her.  This book is great for growing up kids; how wonderful and variable it is to have a friend he/she can depend on and be with to share fun, sad and so so stories to one another.    Wonderful, educational and life experience can be experience in this boo 
 This gets five stars because it was exactly what it advertised itself to be - a classy, compact way to carry the printer anywhere you need to take it.  Space for everything with a bit left over and well padded.  I bought it because I knew I had to take the printer to the family for Christmas and it was perfect 
 Middle to large business managers who want a practical handbook for managing a company's assets should consider this extensive guide a 'must': Key Account Management And Planning focuses on customers and how to retain them, examining the systems and processes of maintaining and expanding a business and developing key account plans. The focus on common problems and solutions makes Key Account Management And Planning an exceptional guide 
 I love this book and greatly enjoyed the battle of wits between Hugh and Cadfael but I don't have much to add to what others have said so...  To the person who was alarmed by corn:  In England corn does not mean maize (a new world crop) but rather any type of grain  - like wheat or barley for example 
 i like this game i play it 4 times in a day with out stoppin 
 It is a great book, and the service to receive it was excellent.  It arrived when when it was suppose to and in great condition! 
 I bought this album for my 82 year-old grandmother who hadn't heard this music in decades.  Needless to say she loved it. Surprisingly though I love listening to it too. Great voices and innocent writing. It is good to listen to pioneers and see where Black music has gone through the decades. Great buy 
 I happened upon these books at a garage sale, musty and in tiny print. I found some of the most delightful caracters especially for the old Heinlein fans. I slowly dug up most of the books from used book stores. Do not miss this book as a starts you on a long adventure. I'd say it's a bit steamy for those times as the hero spends most of his time unclothed! The gals in the parlors must have blushed at that! I also see a close tie to the Star Wars saga, and was surprized to find a Sith in one of his later books. 
 At first glance, this might seem to be yet another standard text about management and employee relations. You'll be pleased to find that, instead, author James G. Clawson has written an engaging book about history, human psychology and the modern workplace. He offers intriguing insights, strong research and even a New Age wrinkle or two, with a few well-placed comments about meditation, inner vision and martial arts. Despite a few redundant passages, this is not a dry HR manual, though it provides helpful professional charts and summaries. With its you-need-to-know-this-now tone and its comments about gravity, magic and inner vision, the book is actually fun. We recommend it to managers at all tiers, to employees seeking advancement and to MBA candidates 
 Great Album.  A few favourite songs were "So Long Jimmy"  A soulful tribute to Jimi Hendrix---( a guess)  Very clever weaving of Jimi's song/album titles into the lyrics,  and "Goodbye"  A great break-up/funerary/moving on tune 
 Patrick Seale's "Struggle for Syria" should be one of the first books anyone interested in Syria or the Middle East reads. It is a crime that Yale UP has allowed it to go out of print. Seale was the first Middle East specialist to give us a comprehensive and extremely lively explanation of how the emerging Arab state system actually worked. What is more, he tied it deftly and imaginatively to the domestic politics of the region - something no one had done so well at the time, and few have come close to emulating since. It is as relevant today as it was in 1965.  Seale was one of the best reporters in the Middle East during the 1960s and remains so today. He interviewed just about every politician and military figure of importance in Syria, where his father taught, and he grew up. His Arabic and French are fluent, and his 6th sense for what makes people tick is unerring.   Some have accused Seale of being soft on Arab nationalism and the early Ba`thists, but no one can claim he didn't know them and understand their view of the world. Every Syria specialist owes Seale a tremendous debt. With out him, we would know half of what we do of Syrian politics in the 20th century. Most of our works are but dull shadows of his. All of us start by contending with his arguments and evidence. I spent years in archives in Washington, London, France, and Syria going over the diplomatic correspondence for the period he wrote about. He never made a mistake of fact. It is quite amazing. So many others did - or they missed important elements of the story.   Seale's biography of Hafiz al-Asad also remains the best book on contemporary Syria. But the Struggle for Syria is a true masterpiece. 
 My son looks forward to his Ranger Rick magazine.  I am glad that we decided to go with Ranger Rick instead of the 4-6 year old magazine version.  Our 4 year old loves the pictures and he loves the information. 
 "The Bible ...In The Beginning" is the first 22 chapters of Genesis, more or less, put into a film, including the stories of Creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah, the Tower of Babel, and of Abraham. Goes for two and a half hours with an intermission too. It's got some great photography, an interesting score, and some great sets like the Tower of Babel and the Ark. It's pretty straightforward for the most part, though the Noah scenes are a bit lighthearted. You can tell they had a lot of fun with all the animals. 
 So yeah, it's got a few flaws, two of linked novellas are fairly similar for instance, but overall I really enjoyed it. If you've read Martin's Ice and Fire series, Tuf is a bit like Tyrion, though not quite as nasty and a little more verbose with his vernacular. The first story feels a bit like Joss Whedon's Firefly, (which any sane person would agree is a good thing,) and progresses from there to a number of other interconnected stories that chronologically follow the same central character as he uses the most powerful vessel in the universe in a number of interesting, entertaining, and always thought provoking ways. Not that the book is all intellectualism and moral dilemma, there are fight scenes, dinosaur attacks etc.  If your a fan of Martin's at all I don't see how you couldn't like this one. It's better than Dying of the Light and most of his early sci-fi short stories. I only had two problems with it. The above mentioned similarity with two of the installments and Tuf's too-oft statement to his cat about the untrustworthiness of strangers. That just got annoying after the third part. But those are really little things. I read it in about three days and enjoyed it thoroughly. As I hope you will. 
 Perferct book for anyone who likes concept art as was done in the starwars books. The 3 artists who worked on this book were all influenced by them. However there is no real 'how the do it' part. Just brief commentary. The visuals are stunning though 
 This book was just what we needed to be able to show our nursery employees the PROPER way (not just they way they thought it shoud be done) to prune our newly planted trees.  The illustrations really help, also.  I am going to make this text part of our orientation process for new hires 
 Dangerous Muse is an intriguing biography of an underrated writer. Caroline Blackwood seemed to be one of those women doomed to live in the shadow of the men in her life (Lucien Freud, Robert Lowell), but managed to transcend the highs and lows of these relationships by becoming a distinctive novelist, short story writer and journalist. Schoenberger's bio is remarkable for its detail (especially Blackwood's Anglo-Irish background), empathy (Blackwood's drinking is put into context and not used as a magic key to explain everything) and lucid explication of Blackwood's eclectic output. If you are a sucker for books about off-beat literati then Dangerous Muse is your proverbial cup of tea. Nice photos too 
 Book number two picks right up and runs with it... there's not a huge amount of boring backstory to catch up those who haven't read the first one, which I liked. The story was fast paced, with a lot more action/adventure in it than the first in the series. I read through it quickly. I must say one thing about the entire Left Behind series is that they are "easy reads" in that you don't have to labor over every word, simple English but not boring. I really enjoyed the second book in the series, almost as much as the first one. (read all my reviews of all the books for a full picture) 
 It took me a week after reading this book to process my thoughts on it. It was a good book, definitely a great present for a young woman, but I ended up being disappointed by the book overall. I couldn't help feeling that the editor of this book did a real slash job on some of these essay to keep them at the 2-4 pages alloted each author. Many of them, including some from writers whose style I am familiar with, seemed very disjointed and thrown together. Many of the paragraphs seem completely unrelated, jumping from one idea to the next without any connection. It made it difficult to read, and took away from the essays.   There are some good essays in there, Joyce Carol Oates' and surprisingly Julia Stiles' were two of my favorites out of the whole book 
 "Colour and the Shape" is plain and simply one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Dave Grohl's musical genius should never be discounted, and his talents far surpass almost anyone in the business today - simply put, he is a living legend.  CATS is simply awesome, from the mellow opener 'Doll' to the sonic assault that is 'Monkeywrench'.  Sonic assault is the perfect word to describe this album.  The setup is interesting, as it goes from a series of short songs, that lead up to big ones.  'Up In Arms' is one of the small songs (great one at that) but its message and length is perfect as the drum intro to 'My Hero' begins.  The last 4 tracks are an absolute treat and 'Everlong', 'Walking After You', and 'New Way Home' is about a strong a 1-2-3 punch to finish of an album as I have ever seen, rivaled by none other.  "Colour and the Shape" is an absolutely essential album.  Many years from now, the ripples left behind by Dave Grohl will be alongside names such as Dylan, Lennon, and Morrison, as the true legends of rock music.  Very highly recommended 
 This is an excellent product that does what you want it to do easily and efficiently.  It is well designed so that different types of labels can be removed and inserted correctly in seconds.    It makes it much easier to get organized and stay organize 
 "The Tragedy of Julius Caesar" by William Shakespeare proves to be an amazing read if one thoroughly enjoys the challenge of deciphering the selective form of writing and occasionally complicated dialect. This classic play is based on the true, factual account of the assassination of Julius Caesar as it truly took place in 44 B.C. Of course, Shakespeare has completely made the story his own through the use of comic relief, characterization, and wonderful original composition. Julius Caesar, the ambitious and prideful dictator of Rome, has returned home from a victorious battle against his fellow Triumvirate, Pompey. As he celebrates and relishes his absolute power, little does he suspect the growing opposition of conspirators, some of whom he would never expect. This read is certainly worthwhile if one has a good taste for tragedy and does not mind a challenge 
 By all standards: WONDERFUL! it's one of the finest movie scores I've got recently. It's quite varied and different to anything I have listened before. It contains great themes from "Les 400 Coups", Jimi Hendrix, Grateful Dead and Françoise Hardy, to end up magnificently with Edith Piaf in the finest remastered version for "Non, Je ne Regrette Rien": you'll listen to Piaf as she is: a Goddess.  Ony two "buts": 1. the themes do not appear in the order they are heard in the film and 2. not all the themes heard in the film are in the CD. In the movie you find the famous Fred Astaire in "Let's Face the Music and Dance", "No Strings" (from "Top Hat")and, among others, the marvelous melody from "Queen Christina" when Greta Garbo is bidding goodbye to the the room she's spent with John Gilbert, a scene which you also see in the movie. Anyhow, for any movie buff who has loved this movie, this soundtrack is a must. If you haven't seen it yet, run to the next video shop and get it: it's an excellent movie, specially for cinema lovers 
 I have recently been on something of a Bill Bryson binge.  After having read The Mother Tongue and Short History of Nearly Everything, which are two of his more scholarly-oriented books, I decided to try this book (perhaps it should be noted that I have yet to read A Walk in the Woods; this title just appealed to me more).  The stories are often clever, and despite his complaining Bryson rarely, if ever, leaves the threshold of good intentions.  You have to realize that he is a reasonable man, and some of these irrational rants are merely for entertainment's sake and should not be analyzed too closely. That said, I agree with the editorial review in that sometimes he enters Dave Barry-like hyperbole, something that I personally find cheap and overdone, although Dave Barry sells lots of books, so many people must think that style is funny.  Personally, the more subtle humor, such as the little pet names for his wife he inserts in what are supposedly transcripts of actual conversations with her, that amuses me, as well as his joyful musings on American life.  Sure, this isn't too profound, but it manages to be intelligent and critical, while maintaining a whimsical air.  I can just picture ol' Bill with a content smirk on his face while writing these articles in his house in Hanover.  To sum it all up, Bill Bryson seems like the kind of guy I would love to have over for dinner, assuming he is as entertaining in person as he is in this book 
 Neal Gabler has done a masterful job, weaving fascinating information, cultural history, and little known personal information surrounding the Disney myth, and has brought it to life in a truly meaningful way. I couldn't set the book down. As a native Californian who went to Disneyland from it's first year onward in a sort of traditional pilgrimage that has been passed down to my children, it's obvious to me that Disney's impact on our culture cannot be overstated, yet Gabler takes a thoughtful and un-boosterish approach while maintaining his obvious respect for his subject. As a minor author myself, and an amatuer urban archeologist very interested in California history during the explosion of creativity that occured in California during it's "Golden Era" (pre-World War II) this book dovetails perfectly with anyone interested in animators, artists, the quirks of gifted people, and the movie industry, during a groundbreaking time in American culture, and beyond that to it's personal implications for us all, genius and non. It's a meaty book, filled with historical antecdotes, yet the narrative flows so well that it sometimes reads like a novel. Elegant language, impressive research, but in the end it's just about a man, albeit a fascinating one, all the creativity that his obsessions propelled, and the cultural leaps that some might take for granted (without having read this book), that came out of a singularly amazing imagination. 
 THIS BOOK IS ABOUT THE AKASHIC RECORDS-OR BOOK OF LIFE- WHICH IS THE STOREHOUSE OF ALL INFORMATION FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS EVER LIVED ON THE EARTH. THE BOOK ALSO PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF HOW EACH OF US CAN TAP INTO  OUR OWN PAST LIVES, OUR PRESENT EXPERIENCES, AND OUR UNFOLDING FUTURES TO  SHAPE OUR OWN DESTINY.  IF YOUR INTERESTED IN EDGAR CAYCE, READ "THERE  IS A RIVER" FIRST, THEN THIS BOOK 
 Tom and Jeanne have written an excellent new book (building on a paper they wrote some time ago) about what they call "analytic competitors", that is to say companies that use their analytic prowess not just to enhance their operations but as their lead competitive differentiator. The book discusses a number of these analytic competitors and gives an overview of how analytics can be used in different areas of the business and how you can move up the analytic sophistication scale.   The book has two parts - one on the nature of analytical competition and one on building an analytic competency. The first describes an analytical competitor and how this approach can be used in both internal and external processes. The second lays out a roadmap for becoming an analytical competitor, how to manage analytical people, a quick overview of a business intelligence architecture and some predictions for the future.  They define an analytical competitor as an organization that uses analytics extensively and systematically to outthink and outexecute the competition. The analytics are in support of a strategic distinctive competency and they argue, persuasively, that without a distinctive capability you cannot be an analytic competitor.   The book outlines what they call four pillars of analytical competition- a distinctiive capability, enterprise-wide analytics, senior management commitment and large scale ambition. They lay out 5 stages of analytic competition from "analytically impaired" to "analytic competitor". The importance of experimentation is made clear and the book repeatedly emphasizes the need for companies and executives to be willing to run the business "by the numbers".  The book is full of stories about how companies compete analytically and this is one of the book's strengths. It also has a great list of questions to ask about a new initiative and outlines a number of ways to get a competitive advantage from your data. Regardless of the competitive approach, the need for analytical executives to be willing to act on the results of analyses is made clear. The book ends with a great list of changes coming.  This is a very interesting book both for those interested in competing on analytics and those interested simply in making more use of their data 
 This past year, it was suggested to me my the publisher of our 6th grade social studies textbook to have the students read the Ch'I-Lin purse in conjunction with our chapter on Ancient China. I cannot tell you how much my students loved this book. They are just wonderful. Of particular interest to my 6th grade girls was the story of the carp fish who gives up her immortality for love. I also have to confess, I really enjoyed this book myself and plan that in years to come, should I have a daughter, I will be reading this book to her 
 The basic premise after all the wash is done, is that those who are what the authors refer to as 'Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)' have figured out the difference between what they want and what they need; that they aren't sucked into the consumerism machine that the marketing hypnotists attempt to impose upon us; and that they understand that there's more than one way to get the things that they need, which often involves innovation, barter, and yes.... a little effort.  A great read, one you should share with your children at the earliest opportunity 
 This is one in a series of several dozen volumes which comprise the "Harvard Business Review Paperback Series." Each offers direct, convenient, and inexpensive access to the best thinking on the given subject in articles originally published by the Harvard Business School Review. I strongly recommend all of the volumes in the series. The individual titles are listed at this Web site: www.hbsp.harvard.edu. The authors of various articles are among the world's most highly regarded experts on the given subject. Each volume has been carefully edited. An Executive Summary introduces each selection.  Supplementary commentaries are also provided in most of the volumes, as is an "About the Contributors" section which usually includes suggestions of other sources which some readers may wish to explore.  Some of the most valuable benefits in this volume are provided by comprehensive charts which, all by themselves, are worth far more than the cost of the book. Here are a few examples.  * The Evolution and Transformation of Customers (page 4) and The Shifting Locus of Core Competencies (page 7): both are provided by C.K. Prahalad and  Venkatram Ramaswamy.  * Are Your Retail Pillars Solid -- or Crumbling? (page 52): Leonard L. Berry identifies the  major differences between inferior retailers from superior retailers.  * The Three Dimensions of Synchronization (page 90): Mohanbir Sawhney explains how any organization can present a single, unified face to the customer -- one that can change as market conditions warrant -- without imposing homogeneity on its people.  * One Destination, Five Roads (page 111) and Teams and Work Groups: It Pays to Know the Difference (page 123): Jon R. Katzenbach and Jason A. Santamaria explain how five practices followed by the U.S. Marine Corps enable it to outperform all other organizations in terms of "engaging the hearts and minds of the front line."  These and other charts are especially helpful whenever a reader wishes to review the key points in any of the eight essays, each of which provides cutting edge thinking and eminently practical advice. Although no bibliography is provided, those who wish to consult other sources need only read the About the Contributors section which will direct them to those sources 
 This is one of the most attractive dog-book I've ever read. You will get more understanding about the world of your beloved dog, that actually, we can humanize dog. The scope of this book is about dog's life, dog's manner,  dog's soul, and....I can't mention all of them. Buy this book, and you will  understand by yourself  
 The New Perspective is a great little book and a very valuable contribution to field of spirituality and consciousness.   More and more people are awakening to the fact that there is more to reality than meets the eye. The physical reality that we perceive with our five senses is only one facet of what is, only one of the views available from the multifaceted prism of perception. Once we begin to explore the whole prism, we become aware that a broader set of rules is operating just beneath the surface of our ordinary reality. We become aware that we create our own reality through our consciousness and, through practice, we become aware that there are ways of navigating such consciousness and of mastering the creation process.  The New Perspective is a book that explores the process of becoming conscious perceivers and creators of ones life, shining light on the rules beneath the surface. The concepts on how to create a better life are explained very simply and effectively through highlighting ten principles/tools that anybody can easily experiment with, with just a little willingness to try something new. There are wonderful little exercises/processes for one to play with in each chapter, so that you can experience these new concepts for yourself, if you so wish.  The book is written in a very personal way by Ron and Denny, a husband and wife team, married for thirty odd years, blessed enough to have been able to share their journey of awakening together from the inception. The book is full of inspiring and very real anecdotes of what living a conscious life means, as Ron and Denny share interesting episodes from their life as a couple, as parents and as individuals on the path. As such the New Perspective is not only interesting and informational, but it is also inspirational. I was feeling a little down in the dumps before reading this book and by the time a got half way through it, I felt back in the driving seat of my life. I was reminded that if I do not like my current creation, I can change it, as I am not a victim of circumstance but a powerful creator. I was reminded that life is a game to play, where, with the right attitude and with a little help from Spirit, we can experience great fun, joy and adventure as we grow into more magnificence and beauty.   Thank you Ron and Denny for bringing forward so well this precious vibration.  
 The perspective I have come to is that for most of my life I lived in a human world which has not been able to offer in any comprehensive way, what really matters.  What is going on is that the sources of human survival, imagination, knowledge and emotional balance have been diminished, distanced, ignored and replaced by an enslaving, stale and insulting world views.  Enter Thomas Berry who after a lifetime of scholarship on human cultures has received the gifts of the scientific community and relit our human drama and our personal value.  We are fortunate to be born into a community that knows how to survive through amazing trials.  We are fortunate to be born into a school that has incomprehensible libraries and teachers to access.  We are made with genes already experienced in phenomenal truth, art, music, flexibility and openness to diversity and enhancing possibility. There is nothing in the vast developing universe that is really foreign to us--it is our home and at this time in human history, we have a dinguished role to play. You'll have to read him to see what these remarks mean.  There is no one I have ever met, heard or read who comes close to explaining the grief and chaos of our times and to offering a healing of being and living as does Thomas Berry.   This is what children need to learn.  This is the heroic task that young adults yearn to be presented.  This is the good news that will bring a sign of contentment to more than our hopes.  This is the story that provides a standard for every profession but especially education, economics, religion and government. At last we begin to hear what really matters 
 I did the "Better Together" promotion and I have to say it was worth it. When you partner this book with Sant's book, you really get a nice blend of complexity and simplicity in delivery.   This book is an easy read and lays out clearly why and when to use a one-page proposal. The difference between this book and Sant's is that Sant's is about how to develop a proposal from a potential client requirement that needs you to do some work for them. Riley's book is more for if you want to propose something to someone that isn't soliciting the help. Like if you felt an unused portion of land near your house would make a nice park. Then buy this book to learn how to pitch your local government and make that project happen. It's not that you couldn't use a one-page proposal for a potential client that solicits a bid from you, but I found the one-pager to be more beneficial for pitching ideas to people within my company and to potential clients that I had an idea for but they didn't come looking for my help.   I recommend this book, but overall recommend buying it with the Sant book because the two together have given me a confidence to write proposals that I couldn't have imagined and business hasn't been better. 
 This book was a fun read, but I wish the author offered more details on how Kirk reprogrammed the simulator computer. Did he use his fellow cadet's computer expertise? How did they get thru security to reprogram the simulator 
 Santa Maria del Fiore may just be the one perfect piece of architecture.  I dare you to go to Florence, see it, and not be moved.  Read this book, and then go climb il Duomo's stairs, passing the frescoes inside the dome to enter the passage between the two domes.  Feel the changes in the sharpness of the stairs' angles.  Climb out at the base of the Lanterna with the city's red roofs stretching beneath you at every angle.  The experience would be exhilerating of itself, but with Ross King's description of the building process echoing through your head, you might find yourself full of wonder and moved to tears like I was.  Three cheers for Ross King.  The man is a walking, talking time machine.  This book is brilliant, the book on the Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel is brilliant, his comments on the Medici family for the PBS Empires special are brilliant.  Far beyond being the simple history of one man or one building, King has filled this book with anecdotal stories and and tangential tie-ins that never wander too far off topic.  This book is an absolute must for anyone even remotely interested in art, architecture, engineering, or Renaissance history.  King is an expert with all of the gifts of a master storyteller 
 After reading "Freakonomics" the author of that book touched on this one.  This book was very enlighting.  Please read it with an open mind!  
 This is a great collection of all the Mrs. Piggle - Wiggle books. This is such a cute book. I remember reading these books when I was little and am very happy to be reading the treasur 
 This book is not easy reading, especially for those with no prior classical education (like me); but for those who take the time to read the material closely and allow it to take hold, the rewards are inestimable.    You'll find yourself choosing your words more carefully, and thereby increasing their impact; being better able to distinguish between sense and nonsense, and thereby improving both the quality of your thinking and the way you are thought of; and polishing your way of speaking, so that not only do you shine, but others see the light.    After both reading and studying "The Trivium" it is not hard to see why its principles were the cornerstone of Western education for over a millennium.  If followed, its lessons turn good minds into great ones 
 Poker is pure Americana, as is Las Vegas, the setting of James McManus's non fiction memoir of murder and gambling.  This is one of the oddest books I've ever read. It's a reporter's memoir on a double assignment he received in 2000 from Harper's magazine. McManus was to cover the World Series of Poker, focusing on the increased prominence of women players. At the same time he was to follow the denouement of the murder trial of the event's manager, Ted Binion, killed two years before by his girlfriend. Or by a self-administered overdose?  But McManus isn't some two-bit scandal sheet reporter. He's a professor of literature. He's an ageing child of the sixties who managed to live fast without dying young, but not for lack of trying. He grew into the American dream of a mortgage and 2.5 kids and with a wife who looks hotter than the topless-dancer-accused-murderess, which we can check since the wife's picture opens chapter two. There's more.   Why sit on the sidelines when he can enter the World Series himself by using Harper's $4000 advance to pay his entry fee. Ethical? Well he told Harper's and his wife. So he competes against 532 players from all over the world and ends up at the final table of six.     McManus writes narcissistic prose, yet he's humble throughout. He dresses the text up with vignettes of famous poker players like Annie Duke and T.J. Cloutier, against whom he ranks himself no higher than an amateur, he thanks his wife and kids and his luck. He takes us on the two week rollercoaster ride he took, with all its emotional ups and downs. Loads of fun.  Vincent Poirier, Toky 
 As a fellow survivor I could appreciate her terrifying downfall almost as much as her subsequent rise from the hell of "incomprehensible demoralization". The fact that this woman survived at all is nothing short of a miracle; the fact that she helped countless other women, including many of my close friends and myself, is beyond words.  If anyone wants to know the real deal about addiction, particularly heroin addiction, I recommend this book above all others; her honesty is heartbreaking and takes you inside the heart, mind, and soul of an addict. The good, the bad, and the ugly 
 As an Ayurvedic esthetician, not only was this the perfect text book, but as a wonderful reference book, too.  It is well written, easy to read, informative and the cover is especially telling.  The woman balancing the  three doshas is the perfect picture of what we try to do with our lives.   Sandr 
 This is the most hilarious movie,with John CAndy stuck inside a terrible soap opera!!HE can control events and turn himself into a hero by using his magic typewriter.It is sooooo funny,the characters are idiots,like the doctor who keeps yelling,"I..am a...medical..DOCTOR!!!',and the man whos being poisoned and his hair comes out and then he wipes his finger over his eyebrow and it comes off in his hand and then his teeth fall into the sink and then he tries to shoot his sister,who is poisoning him,only it isn't really his sister because she was swapped at birth so he accidentally shoots his real sister,and he cant talk properly anymore and so he says,"Ah,shthit." LOLOL.My mum is grossed out by the man who is losing his bits so she taped over the movie once.I love it!!!Its soooo funny 
 I have used Adobe's Classroom in a Book for many different programs over the years and this dual program collection is perhaps the best I have ever seen. It ties together Photoshop Elements which I have been using since the Elements 2 edition with Premiere, which is for me an introduction to editing videos and CDs. I especially like the online videos that purchasers of Photoshop and Premiere Elements can access.  Please keep these training sessions coming. SJRoyc 
 This is the best movie I have seen in ages. It is a must see for anyone with any interest in Tradition/Monarchism. It is very allegorical, showing what you might call a "clash of cultures", but what really translates as culture vs. non-culture. The role America still serves in contemporary times, supposedly giving the world "freedom", but in reality destroying every piece of Tradition in the world at large in the process. The movie chronicles the fate of several Japanese soldiers stationed on the pacific island of Iwo Jima, and how they respond to the overwhelming American assault on the island in 1944. As an amusing side-note I could add that if you have played the game "Battlefield 1942", you will recognize many places on the island.  Ken Watanabe is (as always) sublime in his role as the commanding officer over the island, and several others also perform great acting. The movie is absolutely wonderful, and I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to the very end. It's not often we have the chance to see a film about something that really matters from the minds of Hollywood, and I was highly sceptical when I saw the name of Spielberg, but I guess Mr. Eastwood must have kept "Steven's" darker urges at bay.  Highly recommended as a testament to a nation of honour and Tradition, that now has more or less perished, but for a brief period of time glared brightly. I found real inspiration in this film, as it shows that no matter the odds, the good fight itself is always worth fighting, if for nothing else than the honour to go down with the ship.   Before you start ranting, think for a little while about the scenes in the movie where Watanabe is in America, attending an officer's dinner. If the wife of the American officer adressing Watanabe is the typical American, and Watanabe the typical Japanese officer in those days (and I have no reason to suppose otherwise), then you should contemplate the qualitative difference in Weltanschuung and culture between these two nations. One is a shallow, non-cultured, rambling person, the other a perfect representative of Tradition, honour & suprapersonal meaning.   Probably the best movie I've ever seen. 
 To be completely honest, this isn't the book I thought it was going to be. Most O'Reilly Hacks books start off pretty simply and in a few chapters take you to the further reaches of their subject area. Whilst this is a great way to quickly get a good taste of a particular topic, it has the occasional disadvantage that for subjects that you know well, the first couple of chapters can seem a bit basic. As I know Perl pretty well, I thought I would be on familiar ground for at least half of the book.  I was wrong.  Oh, it started off easily enough. Making use of various browser and command line tools to get easy access to Perl documentation, creating some useful shell aliases to cut down typing for your most common tasks. "Oh yes", I thought smugly to myself, "I know all that". But by about Hack 5 I was reading about little tweaks that I didn't know about. I'd start a hack thinking that I knew everything that the authors were going to cover and end up frustrated that I was on the tube and couldn't immediately try out the new trick I had just learnt.  It's really that kind of book. Pretty much everyone who reads it will pick up something that will it easier for them to get their job done (well, assuming that their job involves writing Perl code!) And, of course, looking at the list of authors, that's only to be expected. The three authors listed on the cover are three of the Perl communities most respected members. And the list of other contributers reads like a who's who of people who are doing interesting things with Perl - people whose use.perl journals are always interesting or whose posts on Perl Monks are worth reading before other people's. Luckily, it turns out that all these excellent programmers can also explain what they are doing (and why they are doing it) very clearly.  Like all books in the Hacks series, it's a little bitty. The hacks are organised into nine broad chapters, but the connections between hacks in the same chapter can sometimes be a bit hard to see. But I enjoyed that. In places it made the book a bit of a rollercoaster ride. You're never quite sure what is coming next, but you know it's going to be fun.  In fact, the more I think about it, the more apt the fairground analogy seems. When you ask Perl programmers what they like about Perl, you'll often hear "fun" mentioned near the top of the list. People use Perl because they enjoy it. And the authors' enjoyment of Perl really comes through in the book. It's obvious that they really wanted to show people the things that they thought were really cool.  Although I did learn useful tips from the earlier part of the book, it was really the last three chapters that were the most useful for me. Chapter 7, Developer Tricks, had a lot of useful things to say about testing, Chapter 8, Know Thy Code, contains a lot of information on using Perl to examine your Perl code and Chapter 9, Expand Your Perl Foo was a grab-bag of obscure (but still useful) Perl tricks.  So where does this book fit in to O'Reilly's Perl canon? I can't recommend it for beginners. But if you're a working Perl programmer with a couple of years' experience then I'd be very surprised if you didn't pick up something that will be useful to you. And don't worry about it overlapping with other books in your Perl library - offhand I can't think of anything in the book that has been covered in any previous Perl book.  All in all, this would make a very useful addition to your Perl library 
 The Mask of Command is a very commendable reading for different audiences: those interested in specific military topics, those interested in history (as myself), those who research on leadership and more, much more, because John Keegan writes with a dynamic and fluent style and expose his ideas very engagingly.  Four historical figures are chosen as examples for this study, we may dissent with the choice. I'm sure every reader will have a different list, if forced to select four characters among the enormous list of suitable candidates. Each Commander is presented in his historical background: political and social circumstances; his staff and soldiers, his ideals and goals, his methods and resources. Then compared and confronted with the other subjects. Here is where Mr. Keegan displays a very imaginative and didactical approach.   A deep insight  into the commandeering skills of these forceful characters, separated in time and space, but very close to each other in the quests they have to solve. Reviewed by Max Yofre 
 O how the landscape has changed!  Fifty years ago there were literally hundreds of independent record labels operating in cities and towns all across the USA.  Many of these companies were fly by night operations that lasted for only a short period of time. Some managed to stick around long enough to have a hit record or two before disappearing from the scene forever.  But, a fair number of these independent labels were quite successful and would leave an indelible mark on American popular music.  This is what "Little Labels-Big Sound" is all about. Whether you are a fan of the blues, rock and roll, R & B, group harmony or jazz, there is little doubt that these "little labels" made a  significant contribution to the development of your kind of music.  Authors Rick Kennedy and Randy McNutt have focused on 10 of these important independent labels.  It is a very readable and highly entertaining book that both record collectors and history buffs are sure to enjoy. Hoagy Carmicheal and Louis Armstrong spent their formative years in the 1920's at Gennett Records, a small indie based in Richmond, In.  When a young and dynamic James Brown audtioned for King Records in the mid 1950's, label owner Syd Nathan remarked "Nobody wants to hear that noise."  History would indeed prove him wrong.  Most critics agree that jazz legend Charlie Parker made his finest recordings at Ross Russell's Dial records.  "Little Labels-Big Sound" tells the story of how Charlie Parker wound up at Dial.  There are also chapters devoted to seven other notable indies including Sun, Riverside, Monument and Duke-Peacock. I enjoyed reading about them all.   Today, a few major conglomerates dominate the music business.  There is little for most of us to get excited about. "Little Labels-Big Sound" fondly recalls that time in America when small record labels flourished and creativity thrived.  It is worth remembering.  Recommended 
 What was the political and economic environment of Jerusalem during Jesus' last week on Earth? How did his actions reflect his political outlook, as well as his spiritual purpose?  In this excellent short book, Jesus emerges as a rebel-Messiah against the unholy alliance of Rome and the Temple authorities. The authors call that alliance a "domination system" which exploited and oppressed most of the Jewish population. Throughout this scholarly book, we examine the powerful symbolism of Christ's words and action within this special context.   In Jesus' eyes, the authors say, The Temple had become an paragon of injustice, greed and dishonesty rather than a place to worship God. It was "a fig tree that would never again bear fruit." It was a den of robbers and a betrayal of God's most important principles.  Borg and Crossen are careful to emphasize that Jesus was not anti-Jewish or anti-Judaism. Just the opposite, in fact. He was profoundly sad and angry about the insidious use of faith to control others and appease a hostile occupying force. Here, each day of Christ's final week is examined in detail, primarily through the text of the oldest Gospel -- Mark. Examples of Jesus' strategy abound: For instance, the authors say that Christ's entry into the city on a donkey was staged in direct contrast to the entry of Pilate's army from the West on the same day. Each action, from the Last Supper to the Crucifixion, is examined in the light of rebellion against unjust and ungodly authority.  Of course, there have been many "domination systems" throughout history and many rebels. What sets Jesus apart is...a multitude of things: His message of love (despite hatred), mercy (despite injustice) and forgiveness (despite selfishness). I'd wager that most Christian believers today know virtually nothing about the Temple hierarchy of the First Century or destruction of the Second Temple. For those who are curious, or would like to see another layer of meaning in the passion of Christ, this small book is a good place to start. 
  Back in the 60s, there were many of us involved in "earth ecology".  We protested nuclear power plants; we started "Earth Day" as an awareness of what we are doing to the earth.  We talked about recycling, living "off the grid" and being responsible for what happened to the earth we live on.  We became "aware".   Many of us follow the earth based spirituality path today because we became "aware".   This book represents Starhawk's return to that idea, resurrecting the feeling of living in harmony with the Earth and respecting Our Mother as we should.  With this book, Starhawk wants to show us that we need to be more than just "aware".  The book looks at our connection with magic, the four elements we work with and how it relates to our beliefs and to the earth and its ecology.  The book is filled with stories of her recent workings.  It discusses how we connect with each of the elements in nature and provides meditations on the earth, the elements and finding our own place of balance in this world.  And all of this is deeply rooted in Goddess Spirituality.  This is a book on personal responsibility to protecting the earth's delicate ecology.  This is a book on earth based spirituality.  This book is about magic. This is a book about Starhawk and how she has been dealing with all these issues.  This is a book about finding where you fit into this whole equation.  As I read through this book, I found myself agreeing with some of the material that Starhawk was discussing.  I also found myself disagreeing on some points.  This books intention is to raise personal response.   As you read the material that Starhawk provides for the mediations and then work through the meditations, the idea is to reflect on your own connections to these ideas, and the workings are meant to provoke personal response.  Each person's response will be different, though the material provided for meditation is meant to focus you on specific ideas.  There are many personal stories told by Starhawk about her recent involvement in political actions.  Each of these stories, be it the fire protection ritual she is involved with in the opening of the book, or her research about genetically engineered seeds and the World Trade Organization, we see Starhawk's  view on personal responsibility carried to many different levels.   While there is much here that should be reviewed and her resources for the information provided is extensive (her Select Bibliography is impressive as well) it is up to the individual as to how this affects each of us and how involved we want to be with the processes that Starhawk discusses.  This is a book that combines Starhawk's personal path of spirituality with her own personal path of ecological responsibility.   Those who are not familiar with these issues will find that this book can be used as a handbook for personal exploration.  It is a book of awareness of the kinds of issues that many of us should at least be familiar.  There are many issues addressed here that makes this a good book of information,  even though it may seem a bit extreme at times.  If you remember how passionate Starhawk is about her chosen path, you can then understand the extremities.  This book does allow for you to find your own small part in how all this plays out; you need not be as involved as Starhawk, but you may also find yourself provoked to action by the information provided.  This book is one that should be carefully read, openly discussed, and as you meditate upon the information provided, you will need to know the scope of your own abilities and how deeply your personal responsibility for the issues flows.  This book may help you find this.    This is a very good look at Starhawk's recent path of earth based spirituality and responsibility for the earth, and one that every follower of Starhawk's path will want to read.  boudic 
 Dennett's metaphor for Darwinism is that acts like a Universal Acid upon everything it touches--and that means literally everything.  It eats into the foundations of the hard sciences, the various and rather less solid underpinnings of the social sciences, the sometimes ridiculous and sometimes incisive branches of psychology, and the claims made as to any potential (though often simply vaporous and intentionally obscure) philosophical or theological `truths' in the round.  There is nothing that it does not take a substantial bite from, and that fact cannot be avoided unless you merely opt for silly, ignorant avoidance, i.e., you either refute or run for cover!  Bravo Dennett, then, as somebody needed to say this as loudly as possible.  ALL the work we have done to understand ourselves and our origins needs to be refigured in the light of Darwin, and thankfully Dennett is both brave enough and smart enough to take the heat and rebound the criticism from numerous sources.  Anyway, here are the facts as offered:  We evolved via an unguided process which, while merely running dumb, non-conscious algorithms, didn't care in the slightest that it would produce us.  Most of our evolutionary history is bacterial.  Nothing much happened for billions of years and then multi-cellular life literally stumbled onto a process by which it could reproduce itself more effectively.  You then find functional fit all the way up and all the way down.  A goal was never on the agenda.  There is no teleological drive in the cosmos - not one single hint of it.  So, bang goes Intelligent Design and bang goes Creation Science.  Rather than a God of the Gaps there are rather very few gaps (which are, in any case, closing all the time) and no God needed for the process.   In place of that we have only brute facts and a `designer' that is no more conscious of its effort towards any perceived result than a coin-toss tournament is conscious of its overall activity.  Life is a chemical process which doesn't care about us at all.  As Dawkin's so aptly stated, blind fortuitous luck, suffering and unremitting process are exactly what we should expect from a cosmos of the kind we inhabit--and that is exactly what we find when we survey our existence with an informed eye, stripped of idealism, religion and dull-witted superstition.  Our consciousness is a product (certainly not a cause - please check the evidence, not the foo-foo, highly selective and pre-scientific rubbish touted by people like Ken Wilber or any other religious Advaita/Buddhist/Hindu/Christian or otherwise Mystical salesperson) of the above stated process.  We are not special in any religious sense, our children are not special in any religious sense, and any awareness we have of life in general or of our own existence will terminate at the point of our death as it depends on our biology.  Following Dennett and ALL the neuroscience I can think of, this is true from top to bottom.  The brain is the mind and the brain is a product of evolution - end of story.  Read James Austin to see how spiritual experience can be related to nothing more than a function of the brain, or read Pascal Boyer to see how  religions generally are the products of Darwinian evolution.  Also, Daniel Dennett has written a superb cutting-edge book--although overtly polite and politically tactful in addressing the ignorant religious US right--which carefully refutes religion entitled Breaking The Spell.  In that you will find a number of collated arguments which shatter religious nonsense and call it to account.  Finally, life has no ultimate meaning but only the provisional, varied meanings (which are nonetheless important) that we give to it.  We live, we die and nobody is out there (or in there) recording the event.  As Martin Rees has it, we live in a Cosmic Habitat which has surrounded us and formed us, and that is why we can relate the structure of the world to our lived experience 1-to-1.  There is nothing spooky about that so we can either paddle in an artificially prolonged mystery, or notice the overt contrary evidence.  The choice is ours and hopefully it is just our own time, while not our children's, that we are wasting coming to a solid conclusion.  Anyway, 10 out of 5 points to Dennett, while to any religious reader I suggest that they should get a life like I did! ;-)  The perspective from real evidence is truly magnificent and completely awe-inspiring, at least compared to the childish myths that I grew up with and managed to dump before I turned 20.  As Dennett asks, if God made the world then who made God? Supergod?  And if then a Superdupergod made Supergod then who made him, and onwards, into the ridiculous.  Get beyond it, guys, and find out out how you got here! 
 I bought this book not that long after my ex and I broke up, and I have to say that it has helped my tremendously with the healing process. The day-by-day guide provided a lot of food-for-thought that would serve me well during my counselling sessions as my thearpist and I would talk about the different tips and insights from the book. I recommend it to anyone with a broken heart.  
 A well rounded comprehensive guide to TA thats easy to read and apply. A great value for the price, good up to date information for the student of the markets. Filled with many easy to understand diagrams and scenarios, A good buy 
 This autobiography is one which has attracted me several times in my life.  Nelson Mandela is the quintessential optimist.  He finds joy in small things, keeps calm, avoids anger and retribution, furthers his cause peacefully...all while serving 27 years in a cruel prison.  He never makes an excuse or says that "he cannot" to anything.  The writing is gripping and I would call this book a "page-turner".  I purchased the recent copies to give to others because I want to share the wonderful experience of reading how one individual can show us all how to live 
 As a first year law student, I found this book to be a valuable companion to class lectures and other homework assignments, providing clarification, elaboration and insight into this complex and rich subject.  If you have not yet had the privilege of adding this to your library, I especially  recommend it at this critical period for many -- a few weeks before final  examinations 
 My therapist recommended this as a "step above" many self-help books.  I have not read it yet because it appears to be out of print, however I am hoping it will become available soon.  My therapist thinks  highly enough of this book that she volunteered to go shopping for it in  some used bookstores on my behalf 
          Diane Ravitch discusses the development of censorship in textbooks and on tests that has been slowly integrated into the educational system.  She speaks about the rights of the First Amendment pertaining to free speech, and provides a detailed history of how censorship has become a part of the textbooks and tests that have been developed.  The book is informative and thought- provoking. 	Ravitch starts by discussing the creation of bias and sensitivity boards and how they have come to dominate what can and cannot be said in certain literature for education.  She goes on to talk about certain topics and words that must not be used.  This list is ridiculous and completely irrational.  Due to left and right wing intervention, almost everything of interest has been stripped from the educational requirements.  Ravitch discusses in great detail the effort of both sides and what their motives were in demanding that certain changes be made in textbooks and tests.  She goes further to detail the goals of each side and how they were met.  She argues that such censorship keeps children from learning historically accurate facts because adults would rather paint a picture of Utopia and keep children from feeling any emotions.   	Ravitch presents a good, convincing argument with concrete reasoning to support her views.  To the best of my knowledge and research, she has done a great job at gathering accurate information about what has been going on in publishing companies and the struggles they have faced from bias and sensitivity reviews, feminists, minorities, and other groups.  Her reasoning is inductively strong with few logical fallacies.  Occasionally, Ravitch begs the question through circular reasoning and attacks the motives of some publishing companies.  Although she has clear concise points, Ravitch intermittently distorts the timeline within chapters, which is slightly confusing.  Her claims are logically consistent and her argument seems complete with all the relevant evidence presented.  Throughout research, Ravitch manages to also find publishing companies who have tried to change standards and incorporate more accurate facts in textbooks and what happens to these companies when they go against the bias and sensitivity rules.  The argument Ravitch presents is a historically accurate account of censorship in textbooks, fairly and effectively arguing her point.   	Today, more and more people are beginning to notice what is going on with censorship in textbooks and are speaking up and taking steps toward removing these censors.  Textbooks are becoming more accurate, and classic literature reintroduced to the classroom.  Ravitch calls for the dispersion of the "language police" and a return to the "freedom of speech" that everyone has the right to exercise.   
 This book gives a very deep insight in the problems of the creation of systems with some intelligence. 
 For anyone who loves to do the Sunday-afternoon-drive-around-and-look-at-old-houses thing, this is the book for you. The quality of the photos is really impressive and while I suppose it'd best be described as a coffee-table book, it also contains a fair quantity of information about the houses and their style and influence and history of design.  While there is some history and corollary info, I was saddened to see not a word - not ONE word mind you - mentioned about Pacific Ready-Cut Homes. Perhaps you're thinking "what has that got to do with anything?", let me explain.   This book has quite a bit of info on Pasadena and whilst Pasadena is home to a stunning variety of architecture, it's also home to a wonderful collection of bungalows that were originally ordered as KIT HOMES from Pacific Ready-Cut Homes.  That being said, I was truly impressed with "Pure California" and found it to be a fun, easy read and a beautiful book with wonderful, strong-quality (and richly-colored) photos.

 Fawaz Gerges has written an easy to read description of his interviews with a number of Salifi / Wahabbi Muslims particularly the Egyptian Islamacist Kamal el-Said Habib.   These interviews and impressions provide an revealing glimpse into the minds of these potentially violent actors. I found the progression of thought over the years as well as the internal differences of opinion inside the Salifi  sects to be fascinating.   As Gerges admits he initially did not understand the extent to which these violent actors were driven by a detailed reading of the Qu'ran. I hope there are few Western people in 2007 who still think these Jihadists are some crazy folks perverting a great religion. Rather they are trying to discard 13 centuries of revisionist scholarship and return this political religion to it's roots.  Gerges generally stays away from moralizing and his few attempts at evaluating policy prescriptions fall very flat. Never the less, this book is quite valuable if you have never probed the mind of a terrorist.   A further aspect is the extent of the support for terrorism within the Muslim world. It has always been larger than most Westerners have been willing to admit and is growing as they feel threatened by the West, Israel, and America in general. At the same time each accommodation by a Western culture is evaluated as weakness and an opportunity for more aggression.  This is definitely not a stand alone book on Egyptian or any form of Middle Eastern culture. For a more comprehensive history of recent Egyptian culture see Nonie Darwish's "Now they Call Me Infidel." For a very insightful glimpse of recent Lebanese culture and the civil war try Brigitte Gabriel's "Because They Hate."  "Journey of the Jihadist" complements these books in both countries by focusing on the potential terrorists, their similarities, and their differences.  When Gerges discusses Iraq he identifies it's utility to the Jihadists in obtaining recruits, but does not show the fall of Saddam as putting a significant funding source for terrorists out of business. He credits Iraq with pulling al Qaeda back to center stage and attracting significant funding for the terrorists. He fails to identify the role Iraq has in attracting and exterminating the more violent elements in the Middle East. His evaluation could be summed up by Ann Coulter's phrase "Damn that Bush! He's made people who hate our guts not like us."  Gerges historic references are disappointing as he normally gives the Jihadist version of the Crusades, the Lebanese civil war, and Jewish history without providing context or correction of their extremely myopic views. A reader unfamiliar with Middle Eastern history would come away misinformed 
 When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare!   Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again.   When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better!   I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights!   2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter!   I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep 
 I rarely like a movie better than the book but it seems that sometimes a director knows when to cut out unfavorable aspects better than a book editor.  This was still a very good book and I highly recommend it. 
 Even if you're a fan, you probably haven't seen most of these videos.  That is, unless you own Video Croissant, and even then you've only seen the videos up until "Angel Dust".  The subsequent productions got little (if any) airtime in the U.S.  This is for the same reason that FNM gets frequently compared to the Pixies; not due to any musical similarity, but because both bands, while equally brilliant, and largely successful in Europe and Australia, were virtually ignored in their home country.  Check this video out, it's worth it...you even get a classic Hitchcock film (remade and) condensed to song length, with Patton starring.  Definitely a video collection worth owning 
 I saw the author at Barnes & Noble earlier this year, and knowing nothing about her as a writer, I dismissed her book as one more self-involved memoir. Was I ever proven delightfully wrong! Her parents' story is so beautifully told, in sentences so artfully crafted as to create an esthetic experience of the highest level. You feel she has carefully adjusted every nuance, every word, and placed each sentence for maximum effect.  In fact, I wonder if her gift for exquisite language is not akin to her mother's for the perfect placement of decoration on her hat designs.  There is a similar obsession with the telling detail, a similar esthetic sensibility.  I loved this story, it moved slowly but it was ultimately so satisfying.  There are really several, four or five, stories -- the colorful Russian relatives, the family's escape from France and early years in New York, the author's upbringing as a neglected child of privilege, the later years of Tatiana's decline and Alex's marriage to a Philippine nurse (read: interloper) and his alienation from Francine and her children. There is so much sheer story telling skill here, told with artistic virtuosity. Francine du Plessix Gray has entirely won me over, and I thoroughly appreciate her as a writer and as a woman of depth and generosity. Most of all, this memoir is indeed one "of parents", not of herself, and that she keeps herself fairly in the background is one of the foremost accomplishments of this luminous memoir 
    Having been a long time fan of John Le Carre's books, I looked forward to enjoying another leisurely voyage into the hearts and minds of his fascinating characters.   The Honourable Schoolboy lived up to my expectations, yet in some ways it disappointed me. The plot is complex enough to keep the reader thoroughly engaged, yet not get lost in Byzantine characterizations.   The Setting-Great Britain: George Smiley, fresh off the discovery of a "mole" inside the hallowed halls of the British Intelligence Service-affectionately dubbed "The Circus" has been tasked with repairing the damage and restoring the tarnished reputation of the service he so loves. In addition, he must find a way to restore relations with their American counterparts known as the "Cousins".   Operating with a limited budget and a skeleton staff, George, between making certain no remaining saboteurs are still operating, is desperately seeking a goldmine to kick start the process of rehabbing his agency. Calling his most reliable people out of "mothballs", he tasks them with following certain leads.   Hong Kong: A lazy Sunday, and a group of journalists are sitting idly, waiting for something-anything, to happen. The startling news that High Haven, the British Intelligence house is empty, all gone- no goodbyes-nothing, sets off an unexpected chain of events, creating a rollicking good tale. Only one of those present will discover a truth that leads to the biggest find in terms of intelligence in a very long time. And the chase is on.   Italy: Jerry Westerby, the impoverished son of an aristocrat and a British intelligence agent, is working fruitlessly on his novel, and chafing under the idleness of forced exile. Yet when a telegram arrives summoning him "home", he has mixed feelings about what this might mean.   The characters in The Honourable Schoolboy are rich and fully realized for the most part. Jerry Westerby-The Honourable Schoolboy, is basically a noble man with very human failings. As an agent, he possesses superb talent and an innate sense of what matters. Even though he must do distasteful things in order to complete his missions, Jerry never loses his sense of humanity. He is George Smiley, fully realized.   Peter Guillam as George Smiley's cupbearer, is a very flawed human being. What matters to Peter is purely political and involves protecting Smiley and himself from disgrace.   Old Craw- an old Hong Kong hand, journalist and agent for the Circus is one of the best in the book. In his speech he gives to young trainees at the school for agents, he demonstrates a clear understanding of how a real field agent handles his assets.   George Smiley. Here is one of the areas that fell down in my opinion. George come across as souless, humorless and very one dimensional. His character is almost robotic, unlike prior novels that featured him. To George anything and everyone is expendable in his quest for the truth. He comes across as a zealot without scruples.   Unlike the other characters I've mentioned, the American "Cousins" are depicted in hard flat emotionless planes. Since even the villains of this work have humane sides, I feel Le Carre allowed his personal dislikes to color his depictions here.   The Honourable Schoolboy is a thoroughly enjoyable read, encompassing much of Asia: Hong Kong, China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. It is a cynical commentary on how our intelligence agencies operated in a pre-9-11 theater, and a sad commentary on how we treat each other.  
 Very motivational with good ideas. It makes you think about what you can do better in your own business 
  Anyone who has read Paolo Coelho, knows how much wisdom there is in his words. This book of short passages are an excellent intro to Coelho if you have not read any other of his books.  Wisdom for life, help through everyday issues and plenty of thoughtful insights for all kinds of situations. A must for anyone who ponders 'The Meaning of Life' 
 This book is all that its cracked up to be and more. After reading the first chapter (first principle) and practicing the guidelines specified, I was able to cut my prescription in half, +7 left and +6 right, down to +2.5 both eyes. My results are proof enough for me and would recommend this book to anyone looking to rid themselves of the crutch that we call glasses 
 My home is home to four cats.  They mostly get along with each other and with the dogs.  However, my cat China, while sweet to humans, is nasty to the other four-legged inhabitants.  He began a spraying spree - I would come home after work to find as many as half a dozen spots sprayed. Since using the Feliway diffuser, in conjunction with an additional cat box in a cat-convenient location, and thorough cleaning and treating (with Feliway spray) of the sprayed areas, I can happily say that in the last 9 months I've only had one or two spraying incidents.  China, while still ornery, is overall much nicer to the other cats and 2 of 3 of the dogs.  I can tell when it's time to replace the diffuser because he becomes a demon again 
 In April, Wizards of the Coast released "Complete Psionic" to be added to their complete character class book series. As a lover of psionics and the complete book series, it was a must on my buy list. However, the book is a mixed bag of worms, both good and bad.  This book was divided similar to the other complete books. They start out with introducing three new character classes: Ardent, Divine Mind and Lurk. While there are mixed feelings across the series about introducing new character classes, they do accomplish what they are trying, provide players with another option. The ardent and divine mind classes introduce divine psionics, and the lurk is a psionic rogue of sorts. The prestige classes they introduce are the anarchic initiate, ebon saint, ectopic adept, flayerspawn psychic, illumine soul, soulbow, storm disciple and the zerth cenobite. Feats are separated into psionic, general, racial, metapsionic, host and illithid heritage. Psionic powers, mantles and items take up the majority of the book and for good reason. They follow with new psionically focused monsters and end with optional rules and a new playable race. Each section has their good, bad and ugly.  The Good: There are a number of good points in this book. The first are the extra powers. This section includes some sorely needed powers that help round out the psion disciplines and extend the possibilities for psionic warriors. Also, the new prestige classes are also excellent additions for metacreativity psions, chaotic psions and fighting focused individuals. A part that stands out about Complete Psionic is that for each class included a background group and example. This brings extra flavor for those people who buy the books just to read them. The zerth cenobite is particularly interesting as they describe the limbo monastery in which they train. Besides, who wouldn't enjoy a monk that could hit you so hard, he knocks you into the next century? Well, maybe not that far, but you get the idea, a monk who has power over time. Finally, they add a class that I personally believe was missing, the soulbow. While the name leaves something to be desired, the idea is good. A range / arrow focused mindblade.  The Bad: While this almost falls into "the ugly", I was fairly disappointed in the "divine psionics". Psionics is its own form of magic, there is no need to mix it into something similar to divine spell casters. In fact, doing so takes away the credibility of psionics in a campaign world. However with that said, I will have to see someone play one of the divine classes. It may turn out they are a valuable addition, but I have my doubts. Second, while they have a couple prestige classes, they lack a real strong psion prestige class. Yes they have some, and they are only alright, but they don't really have any that stand out as extremely worth while. This is a bad across all of the psionic books.  The Ugly: First off, this book is horribly edited. Did they even have someone look at it, before the published it? While I enjoy most of the feats, I do feel they set them up far more complicated than it needs to be.  DM suggestions As always psionics is a difficult concept to introduce into campaigns, mainly on on the DM side. There are a number of reasons I have heard in the past. To list two:  * Psionics feels like scifi - of all of the reasons this is probably the most valid reason. Depending on how you and more importantly your players view psionics, some may feel psionics ruin the atmosphere. The simple solution? Ask them about it. What if psionics was just another form of magic, just cast differently... not so scifi.  * Psionics is broken - heard and overstated, and I will simply state it is a myth brought on from second edition psionics. I have tested in numerous ways (both DM and player side), and the numbers do work out. However, the big problem is that psions are extremely versatile. They can do something very powerful, for one moment, then be drained for the rest of the day. That is the key. See how your players handle their psionics, if they do all their powers at once, "remind" them days are long.   For these reasons and others, it usually is the DM that has problems handling a situation. How many campaigns have you put together, planned out an exact situation, to have the players solve it completely differently? Psionic powers are just slightly different than magic, so it is hard to prepare. The easiest way to prepare - expect anything.  As for introducing psionics, I would recommend at first following the psionic / magic is transparent rule. Simply stated, everything psionic is magical in nature. Thus a psionic power just another spell. This means negation, dispels and all that are universal. Play this way for a while, it is a lot easier.  Overall Even with the edits, and the poor choice in divine psionics, I still recommend this book for your dungeons and dragons books collection - if you already have the XPH. It fills in some of the holes in the previous book, and it adds functionality to currently psionic enabled campaigns. - Lionelle Way Revie 
 North & South was the first CD I bought. Lucianas voice surprised me. I have never heard anything like this. After listened so many times I decided to know more about her and buy other stuff. The Poems of Elizabeth Bishop and Other Songs is a great album. The first track is my favourite. I play it everyday. She is a mature singer with a very solid background 
 This is a very underrated movie in Sly's filmography.   In it, he has a really good role as a street wise new york city cop recruited into a newly formed anti-terrorist strike force to catch Wulfgar (an exceptional american movie debut from Rutger Hauer), a crafty international terrorist intent on making his reputation with a strike in the Big Apple.  Deke DaSilva is an interesting, intelligent hero and Stallone plays him well. This character is a lot more interesting than John Rambo!    The action sequences are great. The first time Stallone and Hauer's eyes meet(ironically, on a nightclub dance floor!) is incredibly suspenseful and leads to one of the most thrilling chase sequences you will ever see.  "Nighthawks" should have been the first movie of a stallone signature action franchise, not "First Blood."   The New York terrorist plot was way ahead of its time (this came out a full 20 years before 9/11) and could have led to a whole slew of great action films with a more realistic Stallone action hero at their center.    
 i wasnt expecting something like this from the little  mrs.pretty victoria beckam. this was actually pretty cool if you like pop music you should buy it!its great that shes still posh spice likes shes always been. her lyrics are amazing. i really never understood why she walked around being posh beacuase it doesnt look fun just walking arund all classy and showing your self off like she does. but like i said this is a good album if you love pop music you should buy it 
 There are two kinds of movie scores in the world. There's the operatic tones of films like Star Wars that truly embody the film itself. But, in some ways it is somewhat limiting. You cannot hear the  "Imperial March" without thinking of a certain  Dark Lord of the Sith! Which  brings me to my second kind of score. What I call "drifters".  Music that gives your mind room to imagine. Gives your imagination freedom  to picture any kind of image to go along with the score. Amistad is just  such a score. Filled with vague but harmonous melodies and fertile African  themed rhythms that  truly let the mind make up all kinds of images and  visions. Pop in Amistad, lay down, close your  eyes and begin to drift into  your own symphonic journey 
 This set is absolutely incredible!  Every single pitch of the '79 World Series is here.  I was 12 when I last saw these games, and viewing them again has brought back so many memories.  From Stargell's dingers and Teke's funky deliver, to that weird rainbow head guy behind the plate in Baltimore.  It all came back to me the instant I saw it again.  Unlike today, all the players seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely, even when they were playing hurt.  And the comradarie between the two teams is refreshingly evident.  If you're interested in baseball (even a little bit), I highly recommend this.  If you're like Howard Cosell, who seemed more interested in arguing with Drysdale and checking out the player's wives, you won't be disappointed either.  These DVD's will get me through at least 2 or 3 more sub .500 Pirates seasons 
 I discovered this book, and my own sexuality, in the late "50's."  Through the years it has been the one title and story that I have always remembered.  Now, I've a new copy and reading it again  has brought back all the memories of the first time I read it.  A beautiful  story with a beautiful ending... I only wish Highsmith had writen a sequel  with Carol and Therese 
 Kant is by far one of the hardest philosophers to understand.  Perhaps the toughest part is that Kant ruminates for several pages on the same subject.  If the reader lets go and takes the reading with a trance-like state, then the reading is not so hard to understand.  Another suggestion: read the first part of the sentence and skip all the commas, and read the very last part of the sentence; then go back and read the whole sentence including all the phrases in between the main clause.  This will open up the eyes to understanding all the tangents Kant tends to take.  A must must must read for those who want to understand the philosophical development of "man and nature" and its progressive development to our post-structural times.  Enjoy the pleasure ... or pain of reading this wonderful book 
 I bought these in black with white stripes almost three years ago.  They have been my primary daily wear sneaker since then, and they are still in wearable condition.  I used to be real careful with them, and brush them off whenever they got soiled, but I stopped doing that for the last year or so.  I trek through dirt, mud, sand, gravel, and miles upon miles of pavement, and these little buggers show almost no treadwear.  The only restorative effort I've made is to replace the laces.  I can see these things lasting at least another year or so, but I'm tempted to simply retire them now, just because I like buying new sneakers.  If you can see yourself rockin' these, then go ahead and add these little beauts to your family.  Your feet will thank you for it 
 Written long before modern realization of how our desire for affluence as part of our "right by birth" has largely caused such things as global warming and elimination of species, Galbraith gives a very indepth exposï¿½ of the origins and tendencies of the North American material ethos.  I would have given this book 4.5 or 5 stars save for the fact that it takes a bit of work on the reader to bring it fully up to date with respect to some of the consequences we now see.    That said, I would heartily recommend this work prior to reading his or other author's more recent works on the direction of modern western society 
 Run of the mill movie guides can only pale in comparison to this smartly written foray into both great cinema and positive relaxation.  Though chapters feature both tried and true and newer releases, there are plenty of suggestions I'd not yet seen.  The selections are not pigeon hole throwbacks that yield to stereotypes.  In fact, a diverse range of tastes, styles, identities, and cinematic flavors are encouraged, from petticoat classics to indie edge.  Extra points for the talent of the writers.  Their annotations are clever, descriptive, and obviously well researched.  The knack for picking up on subtle nuances nudged me to look at vids I thought I knew-- in a completely different light.  I especially enjoyed the "Freudian Slip Ups" (where the authors crack the whip with wicked-fun, exacting blows) 
 Directed by Umberto Lenzi (Man from Deep River). Brings you the second cannibal movie in the trilogy. First it was Man from Deep River, then is was Eaten Alive, and finally it was Cannibal Ferox (Band in 31 countries). I think this is the best cannibal movie in the trilogy. The gore effects are great and very realistic. There is also animal cruelty that spices the movie up as well as Janet Agren as Sheila Morris is impaled in the lower part of her body (were baby are made) by a wooden dildo. This is a great movie, a must have for any cannibal collection. A word of advice do not buy the Shriek Show addition is cut. Buy the EC Entertainment version off abay.com for around the same price, that includes a way better cover 
 I recently saw an article about remote viewing, and was of course curious as to exactly what it was, who did it, how it is done, etc. After searching through Amazon to find a relevant book, I chose this one. I thought it was an interesting read, and fully explains the "what it is" portion of my questions. Although it is not a step by step guide, it is a very good book to see what remote viewing is capable of, and the history of it within our own government. Kudos to Joe for showing us what remote viewing can do, and what it cannot do. The truth is out there, and Joe tells it to you. I would highly suggest reading this book first if you were like me and knew very little about remote viewing. After you have read it, then you will know enough to decide if you want to explore the subject further 
 This puzzle is perfect learning tool.Its not boring and your child will love it 
 The conundrum of John Coltrane's career was that he was one of the most focused and dedicated horn players of all time, while continually searching for something that apparently always remained just beyond his grasp. His tenure with Atlantic Records captures the time that Coltrane came into his own, as a bandleader with a vision, and yet it also captures the restlessness of that vision, and its ability to continually transform itself into something outside his grasp. In this way, Coltrane's music is very much like life itself; while moments of self satisfaction and peace of mind are obtainable for a short while, our very nature as human beings makes certain that anything so desirable remains tenuous. Listen to Coltrane as he stretches out and his dedication to the music is beyond reproach and cannot be questioned. He lived his music as a metaphor for life, and that is why his approach to jazz has endured the test of time. His questions are eternal, and the flashes of brilliance that seem to provide answers, however fleeting, make the quest almost heroic in nature. The Heavyweight Champion is subtitled `The Complete Atlantic Recordings' for good reason. The seven disks included herein compile every known recording that exists in Atlantic's catalog. While such exhaustively inclusive box sets usually indicate that there will be endless repetition, false starts and abandoned ideas, that is not the case here. With the exception of disk seven, which is deliberately segregated from the rest of the box because it documents (quite fascinatingly, actually) a recording session with all of its stops, starts and musical revisions, this box set contains no more than two takes of any given title. The reason for this is that the warehouse where Atlantic's tapes of all unreleased sessions (again, with the exception of disk seven) were stored was destroyed by fire. However unfortunate the historic consequences of this disaster might have been, the result is a well-focused collection of music that portrays John Coltrane as one the most restless and insightful musicians of his (or any) age. All in all, Coltrane recorded thirteen sessions for Atlantic, dating from January 1959 through May 1961. Considering, then, how this collection represents only two and change years of Coltrane's legacy, it is remarkable to hear how much growth and change had taken place in so short a time, especially since it all sounds as if it evolved naturally, rather than from commercial or business influences. Coltrane followed his own muse - often into a corner - but it was his willingness to risk himself that draws any attentive listener inside his vision, trying to see just what he was reaching for. Like Coltrane himself, this box set doesn't provide any unequivocal answers, but it does provide all of the recorded evidence that exists, which means that all the questions are right here to behold. And, as anybody familiar with such things already knows, the way to discovery is in asking the right questions. A-			Tom Rya 
 I have used a queen size Beautyrest pillow for years but wanted a smaller  size for travellig 
 It never ends, luckily!!! I will never tire of Anne's wonderful, lively imagination. In this story, Anne is sixteen, with lovely dark red hair, gray twinkling eyes, and only seven freckles! Anyways, more happens in this story than a change in appearance: Anne becomes the Avonlea schoolma'am, and loves her students like crazy, especially little Paul Irving, who happens to have the same imagination and qeer ways as his teacher. Anne and Marilla even adopt little twins, who also win their love. But when Diana Barry and Anne are wandering down the lane one evening, they stumble upon the lovely Miss Lavender. She has the same imagination too! Well, everything in this story is just as perfect as it's prequel. It's not one of those great first books with dumb sequels...in this case they're both GREAT 
 If you want to live a longer more active life, read this one!!  
 WAITING FOR THE BARBARIANS by J.M. Coetzee, the Nobel Prize Winner in Literature, is a novel about a city magistrate in a frontier village of a nameless empire. The narrator, whose name we do not learn, becomes involved with a "barbarian" woman after a visiting soldier captures some tribespeople and brings them back to the camp for "interrogation." The woman is crippled (specifically, she is hobbled as well as blinded), and the magistrate begins a strange relationship with her.    During their brief romance, so to speak, the magistrate doesn't have sex with this object of his affection, but instead, he likes to wash her body, and fall asleep next to her (he does occasionally see a prostitute in the town, though). The woman has a job during the day in the kitchen. There is genuine affection between the magistrate and the barbarian, while in the town the soldiers from the empire are interrogating (torturing) native peoples and building fear in the town against the barbarians. The magistrate, however, believes that the barbarians are no threat to the Empire, that they have their own rhythm and lifestyle on the land. As the fervor from the Capital builds against the Barbarians, the magistrate finds himself questioning and challenging his own society, particularly after a trip he takes to find the barbarians. When he returns from the dangerous journey, he faces consequences that cause the reader to question authority, its right to power and its right to brutality.    This novel was one of my favorite Coetzee's, behind "Disgrace" and "Age of Iron," because it has a more cohesive storyline than, say, "Elizabeth Costello" or "In the Heart of the Country." But it was also, again, quinstessentially Coetzee, dealing with some of his consistent issues, such as linguistics and communication, power structures, colonialism, force and meaning, and the journey as process and perhaps a symbol of growth, insight or acceptance. I think we can see in Coetzee, in this earlier work, that these themes and images of the whole are present and pulsing.   The preoccupation with meaning, communication and language is present here. The magistrate collects little wooden slips that he has found in the ruins of a people long since disappeared from the border areas of the frontier town. The marks on the slips and their opaque meaning to the magistrate and his contemporaries illustrate how ephemeral written language can be.   But he also doesn't speak the language of his own people, in terms of understanding the values of the military types who come to represent the empire. And this is where we start to deal with the theme of power, control, the state and colonialism, and the clash of civilizations over legalisms (boundaries, prisoners, etc). The cultural clash comes to be not only between the Empire and the Barbarians, but between the frontier magistrate who sees the barbarians as people and his own aggressive, colonizing culture.   This clash leads to a changed situation for characters in the book. And the book provokes the reader to start working through the question of what does authority really mean? Is force equal to power, really? How does one square a reality in which one is suddenly at odds with the structure and culture that kept one safe for so long? The magistrate struggles with this, as well.  It is as if learning this lessen makes him naive again, and blaming the Empire becomes a panacea for the magistrate, who is, I might add, not a very sympathetic character, but is all we have... We can see the beginning and end on the wooden slips the magistrate collects. The writers of these have gone away, past even memory, the language is meaningless, their words meaningless designs found in the sand.   And as always, with Coetzee, we must consider, what does language even mean? What does it do? Our magistrate loops his thoughts around what words mean, what his self-talk means, what all this has to do with reality and understanding.   This book expertly entwines these themes of colonizers and their language, what it means to them, what they believe, what they tell others, and what they cannot understand through a narrative that is engaging on a plot level as well as a thematic one.   I loved this book. It would, I think, be an effective introduction to the works of Coetzee and also serves as a way to further inform our understanding of his preoccupations, themes and questions. 
  I am a sixth grader.I read this wonderful book called Flipped by Wendelin Van Draanen.The story begins when Bryce moves in accross the street from Juli Baker's house.Bryce and Juli were just seven years old when they met.When Juli first saw Bryce's beautiful blue eyes,she immediately fell in love with him.From second grade to seventh she has been stalking and embarrassing him.Bryce did whatever he could to make her vanish from his life,like the time he went out with Juli's worst enemy,Shelly Stalls.But it wasn't all bad to have Juli around.When Mr.Mertins assigned seats with Juli and Bryce sitting together,Bryce was able to copy answers from her during a test or quiz.     Later on in the book Juli and Bryce face new things.Bryce has his grandfather staying over his house and Juli found her favorite place,on top of the sycamore tree.While waiting for the bus,Juli would climb up the sycamore tree and look at the magnificent view it gave.Then one day,men with chainsaws cut down Juli's tree.Juli was really upset so her father made her a painting of her sycamore tree to make her feel better. Juli also made it in the front of the MAYFIELD TIMES newspaper.When Bryce's grandfather read Juli's story,he became interested with Juli.      The next partof the story when Juli was mad at Bryce was when her hens laid eggs.They laid so much she even sold them to her other neighbors,but she gave it to Bryce's family for free.When Bryce recieved the eggs he talked about them to his parents during dinner.He told them that Juli had a yard full of waste,poop,and unheathy plants.His father told him to just throw it away.When Juli discovered that Bryce was throwing her precious eggs away,she became upset with him and tried not to talk to him again.Bryce told Juli he was sorry but she wouldn't listen.After Bryce's mistake with Juli's eggs,the Loskis invited the Bakers to a dinner.Juli still didn't talk or even look at Bryce during the dinner.Then Bryce had to admit,he missed the old Juli.Will Bryce change his opinions about Juli??Will Juli lose interest in Bryce??Read the book to find out.     
 There is never a dull moment with this magazine! You never know what the next story is going to be...just that it will be a great read! Really good photography and illustrations too!  So if you are interested in what makes this world tick...check out Smithsonian Magazine 
 This will be a very short review on a book that has long been with me. While working on a reproductive biology macaw research project climbing into the canopy of the Amazon each day for 3 months i found ONE RIVER one night piled amongst the research literature. Even though i had the Amazon literally ground into my bones after so many days of hard labor i could not put this book down each night reading by candle. Could one gourge on steak then still enjoy reading about cattle? This is simply a fascinating, and most well written book on arguably the most complex wonderful ecosystem as experienced by a most hard working curiously gifted individual. Do your soul a favor and read this book 5 times!! 
 I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS BOOK! This is my favorite Anne book, hands and hooves down. I liked hearing about Anne's full transition into womanhood and the fact that she never really let her full spirit be crushed. Gilbert was a little too soppy in this story, but it is okay. And I really, really enjoyed the wedding scene. And the whole Leslie Moore story is so exciting, but sad...until she meets the sexy (by 1900's terms :-p )Owen Ford! And Captain Jim is something else...he is such an enjoyable, lovable character and the story of lost Margaret is slightly cliched (perfect love swept away, man vows never to love anyone else), but WONDERFUL 
 James Surowiecki's "The Wisdom of Crowds" is a readable and understandable book that attempts to bring an esoteric concept and present it to the layman.  Surowiecki's thesis is simple: a group of people that is diverse, independent, and decentralized usually reaches a better solution to a problem than even the best experts.  Surowiecki is a columnist with the "New Yorker," and the book reads like a collection of columns, with short, digestible sections discussing smaller ideas that all lead to his thesis.  He uses case studies, sociological experiments, stock market activity, and other research to build his case.  Although he offers many qualifications, he does a very good job showing that the marketplace of ideas usually produces the best answer.  "The Wisdom of Crowds" sets out what it means to do and helps explain how the world actually works - why the experts are often wrong and why the majority is usually right.  While it may be beneficial to managers and leaders looking to incorporate these ideas into their leadership styles, it is a great read for almost anyone wanting to understand a little more about human behavior and how the world works. 
 This is an amazing book that is beautifully written and packed with ideas. It has several sample welcoming ceremonies that you can do, but it also provides enough information for you to make up your own using different elements of each. I loved the cultural information and the suggestions for creating altars. I think this would make a great baby shower gift and is a must read for all pregnant women 
 Violence is often linked to propaganda, incitement, and biased perceptions of others.  That is why I think Lewis was right to begin his book by giving an example of a bomb that was exploded in 1980 in Paris, at a synagogue.  As Lewis explains, the French Prime Minister said, "They aimed at the Jews and they hit innocent Frenchmen."  Now that is clearly not the way he meant to say it.  But the implication that to some extent, many French people view the Jews as neither French nor innocent is worth investigating.  Lewis starts by explaining some fundamentals: who the Jews were and are, where they lived in the past and live now, what Zionism was and is, and who the Hebrew-speakers were and are.  He then explains the a little of the history of European antisemitism, or Jew-hatred, over the past few centuries.  After that, there is a discussion of Muslim relations with Jews.  This background material allows us to understand a major point Lewis makes: that the close relationship between Germany and the Arab leadership that developed between "1933 and 1945 was due not to a German attempt to win over the Arabs but to a series of Arab approaches to the Germans."    This leads to an explanation of the way most Arabs use the word "Nazi" today.  They don't mean by it "antisemite."  Such an equivalence would make some Arabs applaud the Nazis while it could make others sympathize with the Jewish victims of the Nazis.  Instead, the term is used as a term of general abuse, so that it can be applied to Jews.  Lewis then discusses the Arab war first against Zionism and then against the Jews in general.  He shows that many Arabs are outraged at the success of the Jews, who had been a traditionally oppressed minority.  And some view the existence of Israel as unjust.  But even these views are insufficient to explain the many Arab writers who devote plenty of time and effort to reiterate European antisemitic propaganda and distribute it worldwide.  Such efforts are so manifestly counterproductive to everyone, Arabs included, that Lewis feels it is appropriate to see what motivates them.  And here, Lewis makes a final point: Israel and Zionism are being judged largely not on what they are but on a caricature of what they are that is provided by wild and arbitrary accusations against them.  I highly recommend this book 
 I was very satisfied with the text book. It is in almost perfect condition and was delievered in a timely fashion. Impressive! Plus I saved a lot of needed money 
 Definitely "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction" is not J. D. Salinger's most popular and most read work. People who read this book are die-hard fans of this writer and really like the Glass family and are interested in knowing more about them. Those who want to read only one or two Salinger books should stick to "The Catcher in The Rye" and either "Franny and Zooey" or "Nine Stories".  To begin with "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction" is not an easy book. Its rhythm is like a roller coaster, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes up, sometimes down -- but always difficult and inaccessible to those who are not familiar with the Glass's mythology and history. Even Salinger habitus may find some difficult in reading this work.   "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters" tells the story of Seymour's wedding. But, the main character here and narrator is Buddy Glass, the groom's brother, who is the only member of the family to attend the ceremony. All the narrative deals with the fact that Seymour abandon's his bride in the church and doesn't show up.   Buddy is forced to deal whit the situation. He is forced to be with some guests, who happen to be bride's relative. And most of the time he pretends not to be Seymour's brother. Like most Salinger's work, the most important thing in the narrative is the character's thoughts rather than his actions, words etc.   While considering this event, Buddy recreates most of his family's history. And this is a valuable account to those are interested in learn more about the Glasses. So far, sort of a typical Salinger writing.   The second part "Seymour: An Introduction" is more difficult and problematic to those readers. First thing is that is not an introduction -- at least not our typical introduction. First off, because the reader is already familiar with Seymour, from "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters", or from "A Perfect Day the Bananafish" (from "Nine Stories", which happens to be paradoxical, since the short story tells an event that happens later on in the character's life).  Buddy who describes his older brother -- who he happens to admire-- again narrates the story. The narrative this time round is like a labyrinth rather than a roller coaster. The images are formed without a correlation, the narrator jumps from topic to topic making the understanding of his words rather difficult.   Those who are interested in only one Seymour story should go straight to "A Perfect day for Bananafish". It is short, but you'll learn a lot about the character -- actually almost everything you need to know is there. Those who like Salinger and his Glass family, are welcome to read "Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction", but be advised that it is different (not bad, just different) from what you've read from him, about them.  
 I love poverty to rich stories.  It's always interesting to see how the money was received and spent.  It always gives us "little" people hope.  An 8 out of 10!!! --review by the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow 
 I do agree that the fuzzy fotos could have been substituted with some of the others from the 32,000 other pictures gleaned from Project Apollo...But I'm not complaining. I just picked this book up for the tidy sum of $6.98 from the "bargain books" rack at Barnes and Noble. Definitely would have let it pass at $50.00 though 
 Being an easy game in championship mode, the best is when played in multiplayer mode. Hours and hours of fun playing against friends and family.   A must have 
 This was my favorite book as a child, and I still keep a copy on my bookshelf. It is my earliest memory of any kind of poetry, and still sticks with me. Frederick taught me that it is important to see the beauty all around you and to soak it up and process it into some kind of art. Of course I didn't put it into those words when I was young but I had an idea of what it meant and it made me want to write and paint.  If I have children they will know this book and hopefully get from it what I (and just about everyone else who read it) got. Perfect and sublime 
 Yes, this book is biased, and in many cases my opinion differs from that of the author. (I love cozies and cat mysteries, for example.) Still, Mr. Murphy's writing style is most engaging, and I find that it's fun to  mentally argue with him as I read. "The Oxford Companion to Crime and  Mystery Writing" is more comprehensive and objective than "The  Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery," but there is much to learn and  enjoy here that is not in the Oxford book. I see the two books as  complementary rather than as competing. If you are a mystery fan, and if  you can possibly afford it, get both 
 W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is one of the best novels I have ever read. The language is simple. The narration is subtle. The characters are real and display emotions and feelings everyone can identify with. The power of novel becomes apparent when you are reading it. You choke up every once a while, you smile for hours after you have finished reading certain passages, and you comprehend your own self, your woes and possibilities, better through perspectives that novel provides.  Philip Carey is born with a clubfoot, and as he grows up, orphaned, he struggles with his own deformity. The initial quarter of the novel is about his growing up, and details incidents and relationships that shape our hero. He then develops a fancy of becoming a painter and travels to Paris, only to quit few years later to return to London, where he studies to become a doctor. The most engrossing part of novel starts here with the entry of Mildred, the waitress.  The rest of the novel thrives on the passion of Philip, his love that carries him to the edge of self-destruction, and his coming of age. Unrequited love has never been potrayed better. Philip allows himself to become an instrument in hands of cold-hearted Mildred, who repeatedly ruins herself through absurd choices, and ruins him for not withstanding his love and care, he finds himself snubbed, ridiculed, bereft. Eventhough his reason tells him otherwise, Philip is unable to release himself from his passion for a considerable time. As is said in the novel, "But when all was said the important thing was to love rather than to be loved; and he yearned for Mildred with his whole soul."  The novel is lot more than just story of Philip and Mildred, and there are other unforgettable characters. Each person Philip encounters and each friend he makes, leaves an indelible impression on him and the reader. Be it his idealist friend Hayward, who has too much promise too little product, the poet Cronshaw who dies in poverty, Fenny Price whose hard work cannot make her draw even reasonably well, his uncle and aunt whose love is both tacit and beautifully potrayed and the writer Norah who shows Philip of a caring and loving other.   The most charming people in the novel are Athlneys. Athlney brings life and humor into the novel, and I think saves Philip from a total destruction. The novel really highlights the virtue that lies in a simple, happy married life and Anthlneys win over both Philip and readers with their goodness and simplicity. Thorpe Anthlney with his nine children is a jolly character, and be it his conversations or actions, he wins over our hearts outright.   Philip finds love in most unexpected quarters and is surprised by how help crops up from strangers. His every experience makes him as richer as the reader becomes in reading about it. The thoughts about the meaning of life, or about love or religion or about virtue or vice, and about each aspect of life that Philip encounters are spelt out with a subtlety and mastery. These thoughts find easy resonance with the reader, and make Of Human Bondage an unforgettable affair. The honesty of this piece is stunning. This novel, written without any flourishes and intricate wordplay or mystery, is I think a celebration of the deep insight and understanding of the author.  I have read his other works. The Razor's Edge, The Moon and Six Pence as well as his short stories are a proof of Maugham's ability to tell simple tales with great mastery. These, on their own, make Maugham a great novelist. But it is after reading Of Human Bondage that I realized why most novelists and readers have considered this piece as one the greatest pieces in World Literature. Maugham's aim was perhaps of catharisis and he put his own emotions into the characters, and therefore, he's created a work that is timeless and unforgettable. A must read for everyone who can read.  
 You've heard of being a little mouse in the room or a fly on the wall?   Well, Sammy is a spider on the ceiling! This is a good intro to Rosh  Hashanah for small children, who will love the big, colorful illustrations.   I also like the Sammy Spider series because it portrays spiders in a  positive way.  Spiders are our friends -- they eat flies and other annoying  bugs, and are nothing to be afraid of 
 When I was "told" my theme would be "Home Sweet Home" in my 5th unit of study in 1st grade I thought of this book. Though I am not asked to think of anything.  We read it for years gone by in primary classroom instruction, and I ordered it again to read when I had a moment for this unit. That time came today as the children in Room 10 listened for our "key vocabulary" and were enchanted as children have been since the 1940's release of a story about a house becoming obsolete, aging, being replaced by future building while in her day representing the best of her times and quite possibly representing a kind of beauty that can only be understood and appreciated within her true and original context.  This is a story of a beautiful Little House written by the genius of Virginia Lee Burton. She sits "way out in the country" built strong and sturdy, never to be sold for generations of a family to endure within her safe haven. She is happy, she is stable, but she "sees" the lights of the city and she is curious. At this point I feel it safe to interject as a young girl growing up in West Virginia far from city and growing up in the peace of country these words spoke to my heart. I wondered about the city too, wanted to know. I saw the changes in my world, saw future, recall first days seeing a tape recorder, recall the ideas of fast food and the movement of our life into the age of rocket and moon. A great story to explore metaphor with children. How are we like the Little House, how am I?   In the story the Little House watched the seasons, learned the cycles of nature and the book does such a lovely job placing the child reader or listener into this rural setting. For me it is a perfect telling of the naive Garden of Eden before the Fall construct, gamboling, rural, naturalistic with the seasons each illustrated and reinforced with charming traditional illustration for the child. But as the story unfolds the lights of city grow closer with changes entering text and illustration. I grew up with many of these changes, but it tells of horses replaced by roads and machine....Time is passing in the story, an age of mechanized progress enters the pictures.  Gasoline, speed, faster and faster are introduced as concepts that drive the forward progress around the Little House. She is now shown surrounded by track homes, darker clouds, and telephone poles. Crowding enters the page. Artistically it is busy, congested, more active visually, less peaceful. Now the Little House can't be sold, not because of the eternity of a family staying on her piece of land, but because a city has engulfed her and she has no worth relative to the expansion. She sits surrounded now pictorially by building. Written as it is, my classroom children found this "sad", or asked repeatedly if she would "die". I kept saying let's wait a bit and see....but I knew their concern. It would seem headed for sad death. If I were to relate to the Little House metaphorically I feel myself as a teacher as these pages represent, surrounded by the mindless march of time. Looked at as valueless, seen as out of place in a world of "progress". And the Little House misses her fields and flowers accepts this must be "the city" and wonders if she likes it or not.   I must admit I did stop reading here to ask children if they thought this was the life the Little House was "supposed " to live. One child speaking carefully said, " It is the life that she must accept." Another commented, "I know the Little House wanted to see the city but now she can't go back." Such it is when we leave Eden, such it is when the march of progress strips our naivety. Such is taking on our adulthood. Now we are to reconcile truth, reflect, make meaning and find ways to face what we must. To decide based on our rational mind combined with an awareness of things we could never have fathomed and indeed may not understand fully  once revealed. The Little House stands swallowed by city, speed, time, and unable to feel season or know her truths at all.   Buildings are torn, replaced and destroyed around he....r as progress destroys what was replacing it with what is.  Here my students shook with, "Oh no's" and statements like this one, "Oh she's going to die and never know her happiness." It is a point of despair, and interesting thing to place before children. Certainly this is the point in the story that I feel speaks with greatest power. And she decides that she cannot like this place that has grown around her. She has no way to relate to it. It is not a city able to even remotely understand what this Little House knew. Not even listening they are of two different worlds. And she admits sadness. She is filled with sorrow and becomes really broken down and lost.  The ending of the story is about hope. A many generation removed child of this house buys her again, restores and moves her far from city, back to country where she takes her knowledge within her walls and in the calm of the beauty of nature silently resumes her peaceful balance. Once more able to be who she is. Understanding in some way where she has been. Understanding now no longing for that other place. She has conquered longing.  To this tale my students sat in silence and in contemplation. I asked if they would like to draw this little house and all students, all, represented her in the country, in bucolic setting and at the bottom all wrote Home at Peace a phrase they asked me to spell. I'll post these when I find the digital camera. It's a wonderful story fit for any 1st grade as relevant now as ever 
 Some of the psychiatrists or psychiatrists in training that have reviewed this book are sadly influenced by the ideologies and pressupositions of their industry. The fact is, science has never proven that there is such a thing as a non-organic mental illness. The reason why people behave the way they do and have a variety of symptoms is far more complex than "they are lacking some serotonin." Most psychiatrists have already bought into the myth of chemical imbalance as CAUSATIVE of illness. Deep down they have to know this is a leap, if they are truly honest (the human mind is too complex to reduce to single neurotransmitters). Glasser and others have pointed out this leap for years. It is in the best interest of the patient to be honest with them and to genuinely help them get better and live better lives, not just hand them a prescription and say, "See you in a month." Drugs can be helpful for some but they are not the CURE of anything 
 Walt is a long-time proponent of Realism in international relations, publishing especially in the journal International Relations.  This is his latest brief for U.S. foreign policy, and not only is it a rebuke of the Bush Administration's disastrous war on Iraq, "GWOT," and "preemptive war doctrine," which of course is really *preventive*, offensive war, but it outlines a more sensible course of action -- a strategy based on Realist principles.    The bulk of the book examines how the rest of the world is actually responding to U.S. primacy, and why, from the eminently logical point of view that countries pursue their own interests, not ours.  Walt looks at examples of the whole range of possibilities, from balancing (including asymmetric strategies), to "balking" (footdragging), "binding" (to alliances, institutions and norms), and delegitimation (what we call in sociology a "framing" strategy), in the cases of Europe, China, Russia, Arab states, and the whole cast of characters on the world stage.    Only at the end, based on this primer on Realist analysis, does Walt turn to his eminently sensible prognosis for U.S. foreign policy.  He indicts the failed Global Hegemony strategy of the Bush Administration, which has led to active attempts by virtually everyone else to counter the U.S.  After a brief survey of the Selective Engagement strategy of the Bush Sr. and Clinton Administrations, he recommends a return to Offshore Balancing, which was U.S. strategy through most of its history, and which Walt says is perfectly suited to this (no doubt temporary) period of U.S. primacy.  Offshore Balancing is not isolationism, but it would minimize permanent commitments and bases in places like Europe and Asia where our allies should take up their share of the common burden, and will in their own interest if forced to, according to Realist theory.    In lamenting the feckless Bush Administration policies that have put the U.S. in a deep hole in terms of its international standing and alliances, Walt observes that the U.S. is "a remarkably immature Great Power," and that "Americans remain remarkably ignorant of the world" (p. 245).  In contrast to the spate of immature, ignorant books currently flooding the market, calling for a global War on Islam, among other amazing hare-brained ideas, TAMING AMERICAN POWER is a refreshing voice of sanity.      
 This was an amazing book. It touched my heart so deeply and i would recommend it to everyone. 
 This lexicon is, for readers of classical Latin, simply the best.  It is far more useful than its predecessor Lewis and Short (although both are quite adequate).  While certain people may find its not distinguishing for  purposes of alhpabetization between the vocalic and consonantal 'i's and  'u's, any person who needs a lexicon of this size will find this only  slightly annoying: if the modern orthographical practices are so annoying  to you that they hinder your ability to read quickly for more than a day or  two, face it: you cannot read classical latin; buy a cheap dictionary and  take a course or two.  The clarity of the entries should make up for its  not covering later authors.  If you want to read later Latin, however, you  will probably need another dictionary as well. (It is inconceivable to me  that any scholar would claim to be proficient in Latin without a foundation  in the classics 
 If your a fan of progressive rock, you probably already know how good this CD is. In my mind it is the single greatest CD of all time (followed closely by Operation Mindcrime, any of the great Pink Floyd and Rush records)  My only complaint on this DVD, is the sound. I was at this show and the sound at the theater was great. Somewhere, it didn't transfer to the recording. It is not the worst thing I have ever heard, but it doesn't show the bands power live.   Every other aspect of this DVD is well worth the price. I would not want to be with out it. 
 Bucking the Sarge is about a kid named Luther T. Farrel. His mother runs a housing business. Luther is only fifteen and he has a driver's license that says he is eighteen. He calls his mom the Sarge because she is mean like a drill sergeant. The Sarge can make almost everyone in town do something for her. All Luther really cares about is winning the science fair for the third year in a row. If he does this he will be the first kid in the school's history to do this. Sparky is Luther's best friend, and he isn't very smart. Sparky has all these get rich quick schemes, but they all don't seem very good. Luther gets a new roommate named Chester X. Chester X tells Luther about how mean his mom is, and tells Luther what he should do. Next Luther ends up finding things out that his mom had told him which really makes him mad .You would have to read the book to find out more. 	This book was really good, that is why I gave it five stars. What I liked was it was a funny book. You never really new what Luther and Sparky would do next. Like all good books there are some bad parts. What I didn't like was there were some parts where all they would do is talk and not do anything. It got really boring at them parts. 	Someone who would like this book is someone who likes to read funny books. This book is hilarious, because Sparky tells Luther to hit him in the head with a tile and nearly knocks him out. 
 This book was non-stop, edge of your seat suspense.  Very emotional, which is what makes a great romantic suspense.  I could not put it down.  Can't wait to read the next two 
 I definitely liked this sarcastic but warm book about solitary travels thru Europe, interlaced with fragments of a journey taken years earlier with a certain weirdo named Katz.    The glimpses into European culture are just great- how movie tickets are sold here, how food is served with attitude there.  Also, there is great comedy in the scenes of being an odd duck in places like Lichtenstein and MIlan, but also rewarding beauty in Capri and Paris.    I wish two things:  that there had been more about Katz, who is one of the most misanthropic figures I have come across in a while and that generally makes for good comedy; also, that the last three chapters hadn't felt quite so tired. I suspect that that is just a realistic impression of how the author did feel towards the end of his journey  but it was anti-climactic.  
 This is NOT a film to see if you want a roller-coaster ride. This is a film for those that appreciate the subtle. It takes the place of a personal journey to the Gobi Desert to observe the simple day-to-day life of a Mongolian family living as sheep herders -- in yurts -- the middle of giant vistas. These are the memories you might carry for the rest of your life.  If you were lucky, perhaps you'd be there as a small drama unfolded with a mother camel and her rejected calf. And you'd personally witness the unexpected, unbelievable resolution of that situation.   Action fans -- heavy drama fans -- foreign language avoiders -- I can almost guarantee you won't like this. This is for those who long to experience something refreshingly new and inspiring in distant lands 
 This is a wonderful, delightful and simply funny off take on the old three little pigs story.  It is told by the wolf and the story is through his eyes.  Now whether you choose to believe his story or not, is completely up to you.  The wolf is able to tell a pretty convincing tale, but you just don't really know.  This story could be pulled from the newspaper of any of our large city papers today.  The author has a true wit about his writing that is appealing to both  young and old.  The art work is great and fits quite well with the text.  Recommend this one quite highly. 
 Lerner is a liberal dreamer.  He has a vision in his head of better times, that America can be better than the people who populate it; that is that we can attain our stated ideals by fiat -- that our ideals can happen with no costs and no pain to anyone.  It is the real white hope, the new American way: when stuff hit the fan jump into the feel good mode: Dream, but keep your hands on your wallet, and on your private schools, and maintain your distance from the inner city, and keep your hands on your SUV.  And by all means pray more.  It is the same liberal do-gooder delusional thinking under which much very destructive social tinkering and policymaking came about in the 60s and 70s.  It virtually wrecked the black race and further crippled the poor of all races.   This is a dog-eat-dog world and Lerner knows it.  It is "an eat what you kill" "take no prisoners" kind of world. It is Hobbesian and Darwinian all the way to the core.  Fantasy doesn't work; and it does not matter whether the economics are capitalism or socialism. Both produce the same kind of Potemkin village that America has become: inner and outer cities; inner and outer realities, inner and outer worlds. We have socialism, but only for the rich.  For the poor, we have "in your face" vampire capitalism.  So, tell me again how we can "sweet talk" our way out of this 500-year dilemma?   What we need least of all is not more "airy fairy visualizing" but stronger less greedy and less mean-spirited, less racist people, who are willing to put themselves on the line in defense of the higher principles upon which this country was built and which they have never been willing to live up to; people who will make a commitment to something larger than themselves and their SUVs, Botox, breast implants and distancing themselves from those who go to fight their illegitimate wars.    We can only have a stronger country when we make our people stronger, instead of what we are doing now, which is making them weaker, more spoiled, less responsible, and more fake. Look at our leadership; from the Presidency on down, an utter embarrassment to a respectable civilized First World nation.  Two star 
 This ia a must have anyone who can appreciate the the Sound of greatness through headphones, not that this cd will sound any less of a masterpiece with out them....but it is with out a dote a cd better served jacked in. This album is so sharp with sounds once thought forgotten, it cuts like a blade. I cant think of a time when i haven't played this cd at a dinner party or a chill night with good friends When someone hasn't asked who this is and if i can make them a copy. ( I tell them to bye it as it is not often that someone makes a cd that every song is a must hear )  The cd starts out with "Rose Rouge" A very hypnotic Sounding song with a looping beet that puts you in a trance and starts to pull songs that only get better. "So Flute" The 3rd song witch is my faverts is just full of jazzy trippy sounds that makes you Respect the Great  Edouard Labor's raspy flute as it's role as a  much rhythmic and melodic piece of art. "Sure Thing," another high point of the release is what makes this cd a masterpiece that will last for times to come. Centered around A vocal and guitar sample from blues guitarist  John Lee Hooker.This songs gets you Hook, Line & Sinker with its smooth and bluesy beet but I think it is the only time Hooker, Miles Davis, and Taj Mahal ever played together, St. Germain Has the world in his pocket with this one. Do your self a favor and pick this cd up. "Tourist" belongs with (in my mind) The greats in down tempo music, the Thievery Corporation, Massive Attack, Tricky & Federico Aubele's "Gran Hotel Buenos Aires". A must have!!! 
 I review Cussler's books as I read them in series and the rating and comments seem to glow a little more each time. This one is no exception.  As the title of this review says, this is the best there is for adventure, fun, thrills, chills, and laughs out in print today. No this is not grand , old , classic literature and never will be. It is, however, several hours to kickback on the beach, let your imagination run wild with a grin on your face and a drink in hand.  Dirk Pitt is a great hero. Strong-willed, tough, and resourceful to no end. Everyone always compares him to 007 but, he's more along the lines of Indiana Jones with a little MacGyver thrown in.  Like the previous books, Shockwave is a big, over the top, action epic with plenty of daring do, mystery, and even a little heart break. The villians are , as always, rotten to the core and Dirk and the NUMA crew are never say die. So, sparks fly, mayhem ensues, comic book dialogue flows forth, and a great time is had by the reader. Enjoy, then read Flood Tide next. 
 I loved the descriptions of the west Texas terrain, and the tough character of Anna Pidgeon in this unusual mystery.  Anna, a park ranger who escaped NYC after the death of her husband, discovers "accidents" are happening a little too frequently at Guadeloupe Mountains National Park.  The descriptions of her and her fellow NPS employees is fascinating.  I also loved the relationship she has with her psychiatrist sister, whom she frequently calls back in NYC.  The end scene is terrific, as the killer is unveiled and Anna struggles to save her own life in the middle of nowhere.  And I loved the way Anna serves justice in the end 
 Roy, who was a friend, died of ALS -- Lou Gehrig's disease 
 THIS REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN AS A REVIEW OF THE FILM VERSION OF MALTESE FALCON. THE MAIN POINTS THERE APPLY HERE TO THE BOOK . THE DIALOGUE AND SEQUENCING IN THE MOVIE IS VERY CLOSE TO THE WAY THE ACTION UNFOLDS IN THE BOOK.    In literature and film there have been no lack of private detective-types depicted from the urbane Nick Charles (also a Hammett creation) to Mickey Spillane's  rough and tumble Mike Hammer but the classic model for all modern ones is Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade (the Humphrey Bogart role in the film) in Maltese Falcon. Some may argue Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe and may have a point but as for film adaptation Spade wins hands down. Compare, if you will, Bogart's performance in Maltese Falcon with the Big Sleep. Get my point. But enough of that.  What make's Spade the classic is his intrepidness, his orneriness, his dauntless dedication to the task at hand, his sense of irony, his incorruptibility, his willingness to take an inordinate amount of bumps and bruises for paltry fees and his off-hand manner with the ladies and a gun. And in Maltese Falcon he needs all of these qualities and then some.  And for what? It is the bird, stupid. You know, the stuff that dreams are made of. This modern tale of greed and desire gets nicely worked with a cast of adventurers, including Sam's love interest, who are serious, inept, and ultimately dangerous. There is a certain amount of off-hand humor as is warranted by some of the situations thrown in to boot. Sam is well up to handling everything thrown at him by is male adversaries. But, the dame (played by Mary Astor in the film), that is a different question. She is as greedy (if not more so) than the rest but she is ready to use her feminine wiles on even the incorruptible Spade in order to get that damn bird. That, dear friends, puts her beyond the pale and she will have many a lonely night in prison to think that through. In the end Sam's honor and the honor of his profession is intact, and that's what counts.   
 Great Coffee Table or Bathroom book.  You don't need to read it all at once 
 I used them up and they were great and never had any bad burns 
 This tape series change my life. You will find the info and meditation so helpful. They certainly assist as you study energy in your own life You wont be disappointed if you get them  : 
 This book is ironically titled because the real Barry Bonds, who you feel like they know after finishing Jeff Pearlman's thrilling biography, is a man one can neither love nor hate. His excellence is tarnished by his personality which is so obviously confused that, despite the brutality with which he treats others, renders one incapable of hating him. Barry Bonds is yet another example of self-esteem having an inverse relationship with success. Had Bonds been a satisfied young man, he would have never expended every particle of his physical and mental energy conquering a craft which would one day make him a national celebrity and a fabulously wealthy person. Bonds's infinitesimal self-doubt caused him to train like, and with, Jerry Rice and even cry on the rare occasion he had to miss a game, but it also alienated almost everyone he came into contact with. He is a petty, abrasive, and irritable man who is entirely devoid of social skills. This reality makes one pity him which is not the reaction one expects to have towards a finger pointing, whining mega-millionaire. When you look at the numbers over the course of his career, it is readily apparent that Bonds really is the Michael Jordan of baseball, and that most of us don't realize it is directly related to the horrendous way with which he interacts with peers, the press, the fans, and your average citizen. I am a fairly hardened person, but I was shocked to read the passages documenting this icon's habit of berating small children who ask for his autograph. He seems to insult and slight others for absolutely no reason whatsoever. As for steroids and BALCO, Pearlman does not hedge on the issue which is quite appropriate considering the evidence. The author is certain that the allegations against Bonds are true, and the stigma he is now under is doubly tragic because the reality is that the Giant would have gone to the Hall of Fame without an ounce of illegal substance. After the scandal, it's now a crap shoot as to whether or not he'll ever make it to Cooperstown. This is a cautionary tale. 
 I read this to my triplets that are 2 years old and they absolutely loved it. Each time I turned the page and they saw the big animals they tried to do the animal sounds and loved how I raised my voice and hit the book when the ladybug hopped onto different animals.  I highly recommend this for younger kids 
 This book has a lot of fantastic art that has been published in other sources by Games Workshop. It is nice to have all a majority of the highlights in one place. The only major let down of this book is that very few if any art work were made specificaly for this pulbication. There is very little information on how the art was created by any specific artist.  This book includes a LOT of pictures of space marines. It has minor sections devoted to just about every other aspect of Warhammer 40,000 as well.   Overall this book should be in every Warhammer 40,000 fan's library.  I only wish it were bigger and had more to it. 
 This book is incredibly relevant for Christians today.  The church has been infultrated with worldly methods and systems of counseling that contradict the Word of God.  Adams shows the need for Biblcial Counseling and how all Christians are called to this ministry in one form or another.  This is a tremendous book on this subject and is a great starting place for one who wants to know more about what Christians Counseling should be 
 If like several other Americans you would like some answers as to the WHY behind 9/11 --- read this book! It is well-researched and goes in depth into Osama bin Laden's background, motivation etc along with those of many of his followers. Al Qaeda is exposed as a world-wide terror network with varied sources of financing and support. The chapters are broken down so that each provides a new and unique piece to the puzzle. It also dispels some myths that were found in another book about Osama called: 'The Man Who Declared War On America' by Yousef Bodansky. The global reach of Al Qaeda as reported here is truly frightening! If winning the war on terror requires knowing your enemy, then this book goes a long way towards that goal. 
 I was looking for a T-shirt with laughing man's logo on it...  I found where I can get it (except this dvd), but now look what I see here... If you see what I see, you must be hacked! http://blog.livedoor.jp/geek/archives/23151779.html  Only those who watched this series can get what I'm talking about... :-)  BTW, highly recommended to watch and have an experience of this intelligent series 
 I picked up and started this book a few weeks before going to a wedding on the Eastern Shore (at St. Michaels).  By the time of my Maryland week-end, Michener had given me an understanding of the complex history and culture of the area.   Historical fiction at its best. A blend of a strong storyline and interesting historical facts. On numerous occasions, I could not put this book down.  If you are heading to the Eastern Shore or just want a captivating read, look no further 
 I read the first Thomas Covenant Book at a very dark time in my life. I have just finished the second book some years later.  I felt just like Covenant who returns to The Land some forty years later and has to catch up on what's going on. I was glad to see that he hadn't lost his sense of realism and careful evaluation. I know that many call this pessimism, but I call it keeping it real.  My wife and I are both big fans of The Lord of the Rings and Narnia. This series is neither of those. In those stories the hero or heroes know what they are there for and the task at hand, but not so with Covenant. In fact, there are many points in the book where Covenant doesn't know nor cares about what is expected of him. He only seems to act out of self-preservation and frustration. Many are the times when the reader is yelling at the book so as to make Covenant, at the very least, attempt to help. By the way, my wife cannot stand such dark and brewding novels. The Last Battle (Narnia) is dark enough for her.  The battle scenes are great and you are totally swept along, but it is a long and winding road that takes you there.  In short, Thomas Covenant doesn't know what he's doing, but he is still in there trying. However, the toughest enemy seems to be himself. 
 Hamilton's work is chronicled in this volume and showcases his love affair with his subjects and his passion for photography. His work is very sensual and innocent, which considering the bulk of his subject matter (pubescent females) is somewhat daring, but never crosses the line to lecherous. The quality of the printing is excellent, and it is an enjoyable collection  
 This book has helped my wife in our struggle to prepare foods that I can have as a diabetic. I would recommend it to any family in the same situation. I now eat foods I enjoy and live a much happier life.  Thanks a million.  Bill Sargen 
 I would say out of the few colours the white colour is the best, as the rubber molding for the white one seem to be different than all the colour ones. I can tell the white colour is better produced. Not sure is it due to different batch of stock 
 I consider myself knowledgeable about history, especially WW2. After reading just half of "Flags of our Fathers'" I realize how much I 'didn't' know about this part of the war. Most of my research was of the european theatre.  I am so glad I purchased this book. It makes me feel so humble as to my own time spent in uniform for I never had to endure or sacrifice what these young men did.  Anyone thinking of not voting should read this and be sure to vote for these young men gave everything so that we could have that right. Even more they went through hell before they did it. Do yourself a favor and get this book. Richard Neal Huffman - Author of Dreams In Blue: The Real Polic 
 I always loved horror since I was 8 years old.  I saw this movie on TV back in the 50's when it was released and growing up I never saw it again.  So when it was out in DVD well you know the rest!  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to send my response 
 The evil politicians running Nazi Germany had tremendous help from the IBM Company. IBM provided super-fast punchcard sorting equipment to the evil Nazis which where used to keep track of and sort out the populations in the countries which the Nazis controlled. The Nazis identified and tracked the populations of all peoples which they, The Nazis, deemed to be inferior peoples. These peoples were killed, tortured and placed in concentration camps and stripped of all their posessions. We must remember that these atrocities were performed under the direction of the highest politicians in the German government. When politicians, such as these, gain too much power over the people they often will turn rotten. All the citizens of the world must be very careful not to vest too much power in the hands of the politicians running a country 
 This volume is the third in a mini-trilogy within the larger Aubrey-Maturin series, and it's rather more given to personal and political rather than purely naval affairs. Again, it opens where the previous volume closed, with the victory of Shannon over the Chesapeake and the arrival of both at Halifax. While they're being feted by local society for the victory, Jack, in a peke over his lack of mail from home, gets carried away in an indiscretion with a local fortune-hunter, which haunts him for the rest of the book. Diana Villiers, meanwhile, has a parallel problem as a result of her liaison with Johnson in the previous volume. The three finally leave Canada for England on the packet carrying the great news, but are hotly pursued by a couple of American privateers apparently in Johnson's employ; he wants both his papers and his woman back. When they reach England, Steven's own intelligence coup leads to his being sent on a mission to the Baltic, where he must convince a Catalan contingent to desert the Napoleonic cause, and this whole episode is one of the most interesting I've read yet. In the latter stages of the mission, however, Jack and Steven find themselves in the clutches of the French, and then in prison in Paris, and Steven's talents are called for again. This one is more a spy adventure than a sea story, but it's very enjoyable for all that. (It took me an embarrassingly long time to catch on to the title, though. 
 MC Eihts "Last Man Standing" his third album and last before he moved from Epic to Priority is nice. Known by many from movies such as Boyz N the Hood and Menace to Society, and soundtrack songs like "Growin' Up in the Hood". Have to admit I have been sleeping on him for years, never copped an album of his, and only recently got a chance to listen to "Last Man Standing". MC Eiht reps Compton with nice relaxed beats, and hardcore tight lyrics. MC Eiht's and DJ Slip's production is ill and features tracks produced by Daz Dilinger (DPG) and Muggs who are both nice producers. Right now my favourite tracks on the album is Any Meanz, which is a funky laid back track with a dope beat. MC Eiht speaks to the streets, and the album flows nicely throughout. An album worth checking out 
 Between 1975 and 1983, hank made some of the best country rock records out there. Slowly, over the next five years, he became a joke. This album marks the last remnants of the old hank jr. and gives a frightening look at the hank that will dominate for the next several years 
 I've had an Orion StarBlast for over a year now, and even though I have larger, more sophisticated telescopes, it is the one I use most. The setup is instantaneous though, like other reflectors, it takes some time to cool down on cold nights. It's easily portable, and works well as a grab `n go. The short focal length makes it excellent for low power, wide field views of deep sky objects and the moon. Through the StarBlast, I have observed (to name a few) the Ring Nebula, the Andromeda Galaxy (along with its two neighboring galaxies), Galaxies M81 and M82, countless open clusters, the Lagoon and Trifid nebulas, The Eagle Nebula, the nebula in Orion, comets NEAT and LINEAR. Jupiter's belts and moons are apparent at higher power, as are Staurn's rings and the phases of Venus and Mercury. During the last opposition, I could see Martian polar ice caps. During the last lunar eclipse, I had no trouble taking digital photographs through this instrument.   This is the same fast optics formula as the Edmund AstroScan and Bushnell Voyager bowling ball. The StarBlast is far and away the best of the three, but as with the others, the high power views are soft. That feature is not a problem for those of us primarily interested in deep sky. Planetary views could be more detailed, and my own StarBlast won't split the double double in suburban skies. (Orion's somewhat longer 4.5" f 8 dobsonian is more suited to these subjects.) In addition, most globular clusters present as unresolved fuzzy balls, as they will in any instrument of this aperture.  For the price, though, you can't really beat the StarBlast. It works well as a family telescope, or as a casual scope for someone interested but not obsessed by astronomy. It is small, inexpensive, and intuitive enough to be handled by children. It also works nicely for crusty old guys like me who have bigger hardware, but just don't feel like moving it every night. 
 In the story, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi is a mongoose. When a flood washed him away from his home, he is adopted by Teddy and his family. While exploring the garden, he meets Nag and Nagaina, two deadly cobras. Later that night, he overhears the cobras' plot to enter Teddy's house and kill his family. When Nag and Nagaina get inside, Rikki attacks and kills Nag in Teddy's bathroom. The next day, Rikki finds Nagaina's eggs on the ground and begins crushing all of the eggs except for one. When Nagaina threatens to kill Teddy, Rikki distracts her by threatening to destroy her last egg. Then, Rikki chased Nagaina into her hole in the garden and kills her. From then on, Teddy's family hailed Rikki-Tikki-Tavi as a hero for saving them from the two deadly cobras 
 This is a great, thorough, from start-to-finish explanation of how to build a barn for your property.  Beautiful, functional plans, expert easy-to-follow construction detail.  Even how to manage the building permit process.  Highly recommend it 
 Leon Trotsky would seem to most people today, simply by nature of having been a Communist and a founder of the Soviet Union, an utter irrelevance.  Fifty years ago, when Deutscher published this volume of his chronicle Trotsky's life this was not the case.  Trotsky was more libeled by Stalin's Soviet Union and the sycophantic Communist Parties of the Third International than any dissident has ever been by any regime.  Deutscher took it upon himself to save the founder of the Red Army from an oblivion that he did not deserve, and place him in the pantheon of twentieth century giants where he belonged.  The fact that his book is still in print after half a century shows that in the eyes of some portion of the reading public he succeded.  This first volume deals with Trotsky's genesis from a bookish and brilliant student to a commited revolutionary and his successful part--second only Lenin--in leading the Soviet Union to victory against the forces of reaction.  The years of Trotsky's life in exile; as the flamboyant leader of the St. Petersburg Soviet during the 1905 revolution; his violent and polemical disagreements with Lenin on socialist doctrine in the years before the Bolshevik seizure of power; and the often overlooked Trotsky who was a great critic of art and literature are all recounted with utter beauty.  This biography reads like the best fiction because of Deutscher's unbelievable control over the English language--he did not begin using the language on a regular basis until after his thirteith year.  Overall, for anyone interested in the beginning of that great experiment gone awry that has rightfully been consigned ash heap of history--Soviet socialism--this book is an absolute must.  The Trotsky who was responsible for birthing the Soviet Union rightfully appears to the reader, especially in light of the state's collapse in 1991, as one who would have ensured that it would still exist today in a form that would have made the priveleged and the exploiters of the world quack with a fear that the murderous Stalinists never dreamed of--and without all the murder.  Oh Brave world that never was!!     
 Randomly bought this cd because I thought the cover was cool.  Now I can't take the darn thing out of my car.    WARNING- This cd is addictive, but in a GOOD way.   
 This is my all time favorite book! I have never found myself going through so many different emotions while reading one book. It is definately one of Nicholas Sparks bests 
 For those who read the editorial review, know that the "paperback version" is actually an entirely different translation, and while it is abridged, this version is not.   So, for those who read the editorial review and were concerned that this translation was abridged, don't worry, it isn't. However, for those of you who read the editorial review, which sings the praises of the editor, and think that you're getting a version of innordinately high quality in this book, you're not.  the translation is very awkward at points.  it still gets the point accross, just sometimes with little attention paid to grammar 
 For me Sandburg is the poet of 'immortal lines' gleaned from anthologies. " The cat comes in on little cloud's feet' " Tell me if the lovers are the losers in the tombs, the cool tombs" " Chicago, beefhandler, wheat- stacker of the nation" Sandburg writes clearly and some might say is poetry is just prose chopped up into lines, but he has a strength and a humane sense that I find admirable. He is not given today the attention I believe he deserves. An inspiring poet who should be read more than he is. 
 Great all around reference book with good information.  Gives you theory you can understand and valuable facts like standard furniture dimensions, color theory, space requirements in a room and helpful hints all throughout.  Wonderful to find a book like this that has everything in one place.  A keeper in the library 
 This is highly recomended for all Dean Martin's fans.A compilation of songs from the Dean Martin Show give us the artist doing what he did better than anyone:Sing and act. If you have to buy one Dean Martin DVD,don't doubt it.This is THE ONE

 I liked this book alot, it was very different and it gave me alot of ideas of books to read based on what "mood" I am in.  It also gave me some insite to some of the books that I have already read, and how they perceived the books 
 New York, New York, a helluva town. The Bronx is up, but the Battery's down. The people ride in a hole in the groun'. New York, New York, it's a helluva town!  On The Town let MGM showcase some of their very finest talents: Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly and Jules Munshin play three sailors who get a 24 hour pass to see the city. These men play their roles as Chip, Gabey and Ozzie magnificently. They sing and dance with three wonderfully talented ladies: Betty Garrett plays Brunhilde 'Hilde' Esterhazy, Chip's love interest; Ann Miller portrays Claire Huddesen, Ozzie's flirting partner for the day and Vera-Ellen plays Ivy Smith, or "Miss Turnstiles," who is chased after by Gabey.  The movie plot is not very sophisticated; the idea of three sailors on shore leave to see the New York City and find some girls to celebrate with does not require much imagination. However, this remains a classic musical from "The Dream Factory" even today. The song and dance numbers impress me and the campy dance number in the archeological museum amused me and impressed me both at the same time.  The Technicolor cinematography is excellent; and it is my understanding that this was one of the first films, if not the first, to ever be filmed at least partly on location in New York City. The choreography will never cease to amaze you and hold your attention; I couldn't believe how fast Ann Miller could spin around like a top as she danced her way through one of several gigantic and splashy song and dance routines. Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin shine as they dance; and Vera-Ellen dances to perfection as well. Wow!  MGM wanted to inject some humor and some mild suspense into the plot so there is the scene in the archeological museum where an exhibit is destroyed and of course the cops begin the chase for our heroes. The car chase scene reflects careful planning and much forethought.  I completely agree with the reviewer who writes that the film allows the actors to play parts that they could excel at before they became famous for performing other types of roles. For example, Frank Sinatra DOES play a somewhat introverted soul instead of the much rougher guy or "a heavy" as he did in his later years.   Betty Comden and Adolph Green wrote magnificent lyrics for the songs; and the music by Leonard Bernstein could not be any better. Top notch talent!  The DVD does not come with many extras. The best "extra" really is the three minute theatrical trailer for the movie. You can access scenes one at a time or just view the whole movie straight through as I did. There are French subtitles, too.   Despite the many years since On The Town was filmed, this movie remains a classic musical from "Hollywood's Dream Factory," MGM. I am confident that On The Town will remain a classic musical for quite some while to come as well. The dancing, the singing, the filming on location and the superlative cast all make for a timeless and somewhat sweetly sentimental masterpiece.   I highly recommend this film for fans of classic movie musicals. People who enjoy MGM musicals in particular will forgive the thin plot and love this musical forever. Great job, everyone! 
 The main problem in understanding this book is the enormous number of people and factions involved.  The index is vital.  Unlike the previous reviewer, I wish the author had insulted my intelligence by assuming I did  not know anything; some of the most key events and players are treated  lightly, apparently because they are so well known by... everyone other  than me.  Still, seems solid and is readable, if not gripping 
 Perfect fit and soft as can be the more you wash the softer they are 
 I like the book, but I did not appreciate the fact that it has pronunciation guides above every word, which I tend to look at first, so I memorize the pronunciation spelling and not the hebrew spelling.  Otherwise  it is really pretty good for its purpose 
 As you play these Gregorian Chants, think of the days when the monastic people worshipped their God in a divine manner.  Picture the morning mist rising outside of some stone Monastery in the forest, and picture the sound of the chants of these devout men worshipping their creator.  This CD caputres all of this and more.  It calms your spirit and gives you such soothing peace that it is no wonder not more people are buying this CD.  I highly reccomend anyone....yes.....anyone to get this.  A marvelous beauty that is sensational! The Gregorian monks did it again 
 this book is a total eye opener. It gives a great view of what happened at Ruby Ridge, and tells facts about a government out of control 
 If you loved the classic game of Operation and you are a Simpson's fan, what could be better?  The Homer Operation game.  His comments make you laugh.  Great game for any age 
 In typical irreverant fashion, The Girlfriend's Guide was good for  bunch of laughs and smiles preparing for a baby's arrival (always a good thing!), but I found the information a bit more skimpy than I had hoped.  There are so many more products and categories out there that could have been discussed - and no, I'm not talking about ratings.  What was there was good, there just could have been more 
 I was assigned this book in one of my relgion classes, but due to time restraints we were not required to read it. Just out of the blue, one day, I picked up and started reading it. 2 1/2 hours later I had finished it, I was unable to put it down, even for a minute. For that 2 1/2 hours I was transported to WWII Europe and I was very lucky to get out alive. Elie Wiesel shared a part of his life with me, like I have never before experienced. Everyone should put this on their list of books to read 
 This was a really great book.  It's hard to believe one man would be so talented as both songwriter and autobiographer.  It all had a very Beat feel to it, but I might actually like it better than On The Road because it's got all the fantastic enthusiasm for living, but it's so completely devoid of pretense.  It immediately jumped into my top 5.  
 We read Ruby the Copycat in my second-grade classroom, and the kids really gravitated toward it. The illustrations are appropriately stylized to clearly deliver character emotions, and there are subtle details in the pictures that breathe more life into the characters. Ruby reminds me of the nervous child in all of us that seeks to fit in. I highly, highly recommend this book for in-class reading. Buy a class set 
 Any book that claims to be a complete source book, "covering every subject from arithmetic to zoology," sets itself up for criticism. However, we have yet to look up a subject in Rupp's source book without finding some suggested resources. Handily divided into source types such as organizations, catalogs, magazines, books, games, videos, and on-line resources, entries are also categorized for student age range or parent/teacher resource. Entries are evaluative as well as factual. For example: "The Vikings. Glorious adventure set in ninth-century Norway and Britain... The historical detail is preeise and impressive...There's really no graphic gore, but there are raids, brawls, battles, and lots of clashing swords."  Many of the online entries (including organizations, book or game Web sites, and magazines) are incorrect, probably due to the transitory nature of the Web rather than Rupp's fact-checking. Nearly 7 years old, the guide could use revision.  In all, I don't think you will find a more comprehensive guide to good learning materials on the market. This book would be helpful not only for homeschooling parents but also for parents of children in traditional schools who are looking for enriching resources 
 If you really want to know ANYTHING about beer and how it relates to those who've consumed it over time, you need this book. Only a fool could pan this work! It's thoroughly researched and insightful. Buy it. Read it. Then  drink it in 
 If you were doing a surgery rotation on a desert island, and could only have one book - this is it!  Easy to read, concise, fits in your pocket. AND it is loaded with clinical pearls, so you won't look like an idiot on rounds.  I have shined in many "pimp" sessions thanks to this book.  Please, do yourself a favor and get it! 
 My husband and I want our child to get a great start in life by eating healthy, balanced meals.  Of course he'll learn some of that from watching us eat healthy meals.  The rest we'll teach him with the help of this book.  The book starts from infancy and gives suggestions and recipes for baby's first foods and continues to give recipes for finger foods and toddler bites.  This is a book you'll be constantly using for advice, recipes, and ingredient suggestions.  I even use it for my husband and I, on how to properly store and cook veggies and fruits. 
 Riveting and educational!  A page turner!  Marty Mann was an incredible woman and we finally get to read about her life in detail.  This is a must read for those who are recovering from alcoholism, those affected by alcoholism, social service and public health providers and legislatures.  We have much to learn from Marty Mann and we must continue her mission today 
 I have wanted a pressure cooker for some time, and recently received this one as a gift. I have used it a number of times since getting it, and it is becoming my favorite cooking utensil. Since getting it, I have cooked: - beans (less than 25 minutes to perfect texture with NO presoaking) - chicken (25 minutes to fall-of-the bone tenderness) - roast (the most tender, juicy and best tasting my family has eaten)  A 10-quart cooker may be somewhat larger than many people think they need. I love the large size because I can cook for family or for company and don't have to worry about not having enough room. This is a simple to use, easy to clean way to have delicious food for a family in a hurry. From taking a chiken out of the refrigerator to dinner on the table is often less than 40 minutes. While this is also true of other pressure cookers, the Fagor Splendid cooker has easy to use locking mechanisms, and it's simple design makes it reliable and easy to clean.  A couple of suggestions: Read the instructions. While this cooker is simple to use and clean, the instructions contain a number of very useful hints. Had I read the instructions beforehand, my first dish would have been less of a hassle than it was. Second, buy accessories. This pot is just a pot - no trivet, no basket, no spoons, nothing else. To do serious pressure cooking, you need some of these other utensils.  A final comment: you won't get better for this price. I recommend this for any serious cook who has limited time 
 The growth of organometallics is amazing, so we want a systematic book to introduce the developments, and this one is very suitable. Hegedus introduced many new synthetic technology in this book, and they are very useful for chemists research work 
 Evidence is the key word in E IS FOR EVIDENCE, from evidence planted to implement another, to lost evidence, etc. Grafton likes E words because there are lots of them in here to accompany evidence: We have ex-lovers, evasions, enemies, exoneration and endings.  Wow, are you as confused as I was when reading the back of this book?? My advice is not to read the back and just jump right in to it! This is the book where we see that Kinsey Millhone is not a super woman action figure, but can go through the normal garbage that we all experience. Except with Kinsey it's on a much grander scale. E IS FOR EVIDENCE tells a little of Kinsey's background, that she's thirty-two and had been married twice and divorced twice, used to be a cop, doesn't have many close friends (except for Henry) and usually takes the case of the underdog.   Grafton delves more into the personality behind her heroine and lets the reader see more of the real Kinsey Millhone, but so as not to bore you, she also brings us closer to Henry and others with glimpses into their homes and lives.  Another winner for Grafton!  
 USE THE XL MOST EVERY DAY AND FIND THAT IT DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB FOR WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. ONLY USE IT ABOUT TEN MINENTS AT A TIME SINCE I AM 72 I DONT OVERDUE IT. CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY ABDOMEN ALREADY 
 A spectacular book everyone should have the pleasure of reading 
 This book is definitely a must for all those who want the scoop on Bollywood! Well-written and informative. I wish I had bought it sooner. As a Bollywood writer, this is a reference book, which will be close by my writing desk.   I give it 5 stars 
 This book really gave an insightful and intriguing depiction of Sicily, its traditions and its history. The story line carried it along very nicely without reverting to a guide book. I'm Italian American and throughly enjoyed it. This book is a must for those interested in the Island 
 I have previously read every book that a fellow West Virginia Native by the name of Pearl Buck, Pulitzer Prize Winner, wrote concerning China.  I was very impressed by the accuracy that Lisa See utilized in her descriptions of concubines, status of family members, arrangement of marriages, and especially foot binding.  I have seen documentaries of elder chinese women severly maimed by this practice. I highly recommend this book to all women and men alike.  It is beautifully written...can't wait for Ms. See's next book 
      As another reviewer wrote, this book is definitely philosophical. Leilani is an inspiration and how she manages in such a horrible situation is the message in the book. I love it when he brings aliens into a book. Sensimilla was quite similar to my mater and he wrote these parts as though he has been through it, which he has, but none can write the terror that bad parents wreak better than he can. I just discovered him last year and have only read about 15 of his books. I have a lot of reading to do!!! 
 Is there species discrimination afoot in the persistent belief that cats are not loving, loyal, understood?  Well, James Herriot in his delightfully insightful, poignant Cat Stories gives convincing, witty accounts that cats can and do live a dog's life.  Case in point is Buster, a feline retriever who loves to play catch.  Want heroics worthy of Lassie and Rin-Tin_Tin?  Read about Debbie, a stray cat who assures her offspring a good home as a Christmas president to the kitten and the human who adopts it.  Herriot's relationship with his own cats-Olly and Ginny-is a heart-warming leitmotif of the book as he utilizes all of his skills as a compassionate veterinarian to provide for this wild duo 
 He will dig through his basket of, say, 20 books just to find this one.  He is too young to read and has trouble even waiting for me to page through it with him, but if I leave him alone this is the book he picks.  I suppose it is the primary colors and the simple shapes.  I suspect I will have to pick up some more of Barton's books to see if they work too.. 
 It might be worth just buying their albums one by one as most of the songs are good and you wouldn't want to buy this and then double back later.  Matt's guitarwork has the power to make me happy no matter what, it's articulated so well.  The vocals are very smooth and pretty and fun.  The guitar in "us" can stay in my head for days.  There's so much more than kiss me, these people know what their doing, no "one hit wonder" 
 This is great to use in combination with the Big Book of Coloring Pages, if you have a wide span of ages to teach.  I used to teach 1st through 3rd grade Sunday School.  I had found that my third graders were tired of coloring pages, and they liked the puzzels and games better, and that my younger ones prefered coloring.  If you need a "filler" in Children's Church or Sunday School, and you don't have the resources or time to do crafts, this is a great tool to use.  There are puzzles to go with almost every applicable Bibical concept for kids, and they are all reproducible, which means some saved dollars.  I find that it is better for grades 3 and up.  But if you have younger children also, you might want to give them the coloring pages instead.  Or, you could have them do them as "homework" to review their lesson (and give them a little prize when they bring it back the following week) 
 This not-quite-debut novel (Fellowes wrote several romance novels in the mid-'70s under the name Rebecca Greville, including "Poison Presented" and "Court in the Terror") ought to appeal to fans of his 2001 Oscar-winning script for the film Gosford Park. A straightforward satirical comedy of manners set among the upper classes of mid-'90s England and those who aspire to join them, the book is a frothy comic brew which skewers both parties with the kind of pitch-perfect subtle writing that it seems only the British can pull off. The story is quite simple, a pretty woman from an upper middle-class family whose mother has pretentions decides to ensnare a hugely wealthy and dull aristocratic man in order to "marry up" into the upper classes which still hold such a mystique and importance in British society. The man's mother, a formidable Marchioness aims to prevent this from occurring but fails. The young woman discovers that life at the top isn't as exciting as she anticipated and runs off with an handsome actor to great scandal. Will anyone find happiness at the end?  This is all more or less narrated by a semi-aristocratic actor (clearly very much like the author) who is able to move between all worlds due to his upbringing and career. He starts the book as a friend of the young woman and a very passing acquaintance of the young man, and ends up becoming a bridge between worlds and at the latter stages, a kind of discreet go-between. It is his penetrating sardonic insights and the witty formulations thereof which lend what substance there is to this otherwise straightforward love story. Much of the novel involves the narrator spelling out the unspoken rules of the game for the reader in deliciously mocking detail. The main flaw in most satire is that it is too broad or unsubtle, but here the narrator's mockery of the artificially preserved world of the aristocracy is all the more effective from its insider position. To be sure, the characters are mostly "types" without a whole lot of substance or depth to them (the boorish rich pig, the nasty arriviste, the brisk no-nonsense wife, the ice queen, the social climber, etc.), but that's kind of the point as well. A great deal of the satire is that these upper crust people have no personality, that they are all just filling the roles they've seen before them and imagine will extend after them forever. Ultimately, the book is somewhat bittersweet in that the writing is quite amusing, but one can't help but feel slightly sorry for how unhappy so many of the characters are (even if they aren't particularly deeply drawn). On the other hand, it's not too hard to feel like it's a case of them getting their just desserts... 
 My kids love reading this book.  When the bigger fish can't get through the hole, the word is "OUCH".  My kids love that, and think it's so funny.  Beautiful book and cute!  I found this book elsewhere for less than $6.    
 Les Miserables is always wonderful, but the Dream Cast Concert surely deserves a special mention. I have seen the DVD five times, and still am held spellbound by the exquisite music and amazing performances. It is truly the Dream Cast. Colm Wilkinson delivers his songs with a beautifully perfected panache. He manages to portray Valjean with both the veiled threat of the ex-convict and the softened repentance of the philanthropistic mayor. Phillip Quast is the epitomy of Javert, managing to create an Inspector who is both law-bound and human at once.  Alun Armstrong performs the most hilarious Thernadier I have ever seen, expertly backed by Jenny Galloway.  Michael Maguire is a passionately fierce Enjolras, and Michael Ball performs Marius with just the right touch of good humour. Ruthie Henshaw's Fantine is suitably poignant, while Lea Salonga's clear voice and superb acting skills make certain that her Eponine will never be forgotten. While I found the singing and acting fantastic, after a few viewings of the DVD, the discerning watcher becomes more intrigued by what the performers are doing while sitting down. The interaction between Javert and Valjean is especially intriguing. It's satisfying, too, for all those who wished that the two redoubtable characters could have been friends. Also worth a mention is the heart-stopping rendition of Do You Hear The People Sing at the end of the concert performed by 17 Valjean's from some of the World's productions.  I highly reccomend this production. 
 This book is a great guide. All you have to do is spend a gazillion hours practicing. I wish I had that book 80 years ago 
 I sent this book to a freind and since then she has not had the aweful questions she had prior to receiving this book about our beliefs. I read a few reviews before getting this books and I must warn I have never seen or heard of anyone in my family being told to or feeling they should have to ostracize family members for leaving the church for any reason. In fact the opposite is true and they have always tried to help the person who left. I think the person stating that in their review had a bad experiance with a person being that way of their own accord or is a victim of false information 
 A bookaholic writes about how and why.  A great little book to start a book club 
 I think this book should come with the Singer Quantumlock.  Buy it.  The manual that comes with the machine isn't enough.  This book, along with the online materials from Singer, will make your serger usable and enjoyable.   (The book may also be used with other types of sergers.)  Great photos.  I use this book to figure out how to adjust tension and to figure out which type of stitch to use 
 Tom Friedman's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls; states v. markets v. individuals; and the comprehensive failure of the Arab street, leadership and Muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out. From reading this compilation of NYT columns, I understand where Friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book, 'The World is Flat.' Although I sometimes disagree with his opinions, his ability to see the big picture is spot on 
 This is a very well writen book with a lot of excitement.  It was hard to put dow 
 This is not a "pat yourself on the back you can do it book." Romanus Wolter actually rolls up his sleeves and helps you get on track. I have learned how to create a method that helps me make decisions and his formula for developing an elevator pitch was the first time I was able to bring all my ideas about what I want to do into one cohesive sentence. It seems almost too simple but just follow the chapters and in a very short time you will be talking with the big cats.   
 The books is amazing in every way. I wanted to read it after watching the movie, and certainly didn't regret it. Although, not quite. The author paints a picture of a private investigator chasing after a woman he was paid and instructed to find. He does his job, successfully, but then gets mildly infatuated with her. Then simply obsessed. And he also has a daughter who helps him at it; what is unnatural about this daughter one will have to read to find out. What I disliked about this book was its coldness, its cruelty. The book throws you into endless feelings of discomfort and fear; until the very end. Though the main character does, in a sense, get what he wanted, the book felt very unemotional to me. I think the author did an outstanding job at providing this feeling, but in the end I wanted nothing more than to read or watch something with a PG rating. Maybe it's just me. Find out for yourself, you certainly have nothing to lose; I'm still fine 
 If there was ever a time when we needed to be reminded that immigrants are the heart and soul of what makes this a textured, rich and interesting country, this is it.  This book and its companion museum exhibit, which I was lucky enough to come upon serendipitously at Purchase College's Nueberger Museum, celebrates the gifts we have received as a nation from the diverse people who have struggled first to get here, and then to make a life for themselves here.  Before we build walls on borders, before we villify those who are different from us, let's appreciate what we are gaining from the immigrants who choose the US as their home.  Let's remember that very few of us are Native American.  We have all benefitted from the open door to America.   
 Chen Ran's A PRIVATE LIFE is a small and quiet novel that I simply could not put down, offering up a powerful and beautifully written examination of universal themes: the attainment of womanhood, women's social and sexual roles, their relationships with one another, and the psychological traumas often inflicted upon them by the men in their lives (fathers, teachers, boyfriends, lovers).  This book is simultaneously a coming of age story and a deeply moving exploration of a solitary and tortured soul unable (or unwilling) to cope with the world presented to her.  A PRIVATE LIFE traces the main character, Ni Niuniu, from age eleven to adulthood.  Born in 1968, Niuniu traces the arc of her life against the evolving state of women's consciousness in China during the last thirty years of the century.  Told entirely in the first person, the narrator provides us a deeply introspective, almost surreal view of her maturation as a sexual being and her difficulties coping with her feelings in a sexually repressed society.  Chen Ran's approach is at times humorous, at times sensual, and at times dark to the point of paranoia. She has limned a character who increasingly shuts herself off from the world around her until there is little left but her bathtub, which she has converted into her bed, and a fantasy world she has constructed to shelter herself from the harsh realities beyond her door.  Chen Ran's short novel is sad without being maudlin, sensual without being sexual, and horrifying without being melodramatic.  She has drawn a character whom we feel compelled to reach out to, to care for, and yet we know that she is beyond help as we watch her personal world evaporate and her mental world deteriorate.  The prose is rich in imagery, sharp and evocative from the very first page:  "As if being devoured by a huge, pitiless rat, time withers away moment by moment and is lost....Only death, the tombstone over our graves, can stop it."   A PRIVATE LIFE is a truly literary work, easily readable and profoundly moving. It is perhaps the most un-Chinese of the many Chinese novels I have read, reaching a universal plane that frees it from time and place.  Sadly, Chen Ran will not likely be widely read in the United States; it is our loss.  A PRIVATE LIFE deserves a very large public audience which I fear it will never attain.  If you read this review, I urge you to read Chen Ran's wonderful novel; you will not be disappointed.   
 I'm an adult, and about two years ago, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.  On my first-ever trip to an endocrinologist, I -Practiced three times sticking a syringe into a round sponge -Was told to take 3 units of insulin 3 times daily -Was blessed and told "go thou out and be diabetic" (more or less)   This book is largely responsible for the fact that I did not perish after this thorough instruction, but instead have pretty good control (~6 A1C).  What I find most stands out about it is that it puts the responsibility for control where it exists in reality: the mind and body of the person living with diabetes. The tool for control is good data. This approach, and the direct and friendly voice of the author, helps it avoid being judgemental, or feeling as though the author is an omnipotent doctor helping a poor diabetic.  This does not make it a useful book however, only a positive read.  What makes it useful, and the best book on using insulin I have encountered is its focus on the practical, on what works, and on results.  Examples:  - Focuses first on controlling lows (immediate safety), then on highs (long-term health)  - Stresses the importance of consistent data gathering, and even periodically testing my body's response to my basal insulin, which I have found to be central to my control from day to day.  - Teaches insulin uptake response and peaks, helping to be watchful for lows and highs and to understand blood glucose cause and effect  - Establishes key relationships between weight, carb response, insulin response and correction dosages that allowed me to control more closely, and correct more accurately when needed.   If I ever meet the authors of this book I will kiss them. And my spouse might, too 
 I was impressed with the way the author was able to present a large amount of complex information in a very concise and readable format.  The subject itself is interesting and the author was able to substantiate the claims made by this book.  This book was obviously well researched and serves a valuable purpose in showing us that things are not always what they appear to be.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to look beyond the surface and get a more in depth understanding of the complex forces swirling around JFK during his time in office 
 In this book, the author takes a top-down approach to investing. He combined macro economic factors with fundamental/technical approach to the market. In many ways, this book reminds me of Martin Zweig's Winning on Wall Street, which in my eyes is one of the greatest investing books ever published. This book gave me a great number of possible ideas I can use to develop potential models from, and for that it is well worth the purchase price, even if none of them pan out 
 The photos in this book are stunning, revealing, and thought provoking. That said I wish the silly captions had been left out. They are contrived and instead of revealing something about the subjects end up being an annoyance. Instead of viewing the portraits and searching the faces for some primal connection we're given the photographers attempt at humor. The occasional quotes were far more revealing and thoughtful. Ignore the captions, which fortunately were designed to not be physically intrusive, and instead enjoy searching the faces of these wonderful creatures for the little that separates us 
 It's not as good as the first movie. But it is a fun diversion into American Christmas mythology. Tim Allen has warmed up to his role as Santa Claus, and he is regarded as one of the best Santas the North Pole has ever had.  But it is soon discovered that there is a Mrs. Clause: Santa has 28 days to get married, or he doesn't get to be Santa anymore.   In the meantime, one of the elves makes a toy Santa to watch over the workshop. But he rebels, and Tim Allen must return to reclaim the leadership of the North Pole and save the elves from the clutches of the evil toy Santa.  It's all in good fun and it will be a well watched holiday treat for years to come 
 Miss Zukas, intrepid librarian, is shocked and surprised to see police cars around Bellihaven's Public Library, her place of employment.  A dead body has been discovered in the Mo-Ne aisle and no one knows who or why.  The body is identified, but no motive can be established.  Miss Zukas is an observant person, so she puts this ability to work and begins her own amateur investigation with her friend, Ruth.  Jo Dereske weaves a gently amusing plot with interesting characters to create a "cozy" in a library setting.  Mystery fans will enjoy this book 
 Not everyone could do it. In fact, almost no one else that I could think of, could construct a story about a gardener whose main passion in life is to grow a new variety of tulip, and turn it into a compelling, intrigue-filled, heroic romance. But Dumas does, here.  Certainly, Dumas shines in his more famous novels, like The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo, giants of hundreds and hundreds of pages (thousands if you consider the entire Musketeer cycle), repleat with swashbuckling, conspiracy, murder and ladies-fair. It is therefore understandable that some of his audience might be put off by The Black Tulip, which is a scant 200 and some pages, and has its hero in jail for most of the novel, struggling to grow a flower by proxy. But really, the lesson is how great Alexandre Dumas is, because The Black Tulip manages to be just as rewarding (and at times, as thrilling) as his more renowned epics. Also, Dumas here shows some of his versatility and his incredible understanding of humanity, in the lovers conversations between Cornelius and Rosa, and in his rye, good-natured and subtle observations that, really, concentrating on tulip-growing, as opposed to warfare or violence, is a sign of greatness, not of mediocrity.  You can't come to The Black Tulip looking for precisely the same things you'd seek in Dumas' other winners, but if you're looking for a wonderful little story, almost perfectly told, you're in the right place. With this tale, Dumas takes his place as my favorite author, of all time 
 Other titles have provided a history of espionage or specific agents: Hidden Secrets combines a focus on the changing technologies used to support espionage, examining the real world of the spy and using color illustrations, photos, and abundant side-bars of information to explain differences between historical and modern spying. Absorbing and revealing 
 What you have here are songs that are outakes or unfinished in one way or another. Several are historical songs of the Beatles very early on that were recorded on Tape Recorders and do not have the sound quality. What is interesting is that you get to hear them do songs by their idols, such as Buddy Holly and others. The songs on the CD are from the early parts of their career. Most of the songs with minor changes are very much like they appeared on their perspective albums. Freebird is also on here and along with Real Love is the first new Beatles recording in 26 years. That alone is worth the price of the CD. Another song of note is the recording of One After 909. This version in my opinion is actually better than the one that appeared later on Let It Be. There are some live recordings as well. If you are into the historical aspects of music this is a must for any Beatles collector. And for Rock and Roll historians this is a must also 
 Martin Lindstrom's Brand Sense: Build Powerful Brands Through Touch, Taste, Smell, Sight And Sound provides an unusual treatise based on Millward Brown's study linking branding and sensory awareness. 'Sensory branding' is a relatively new concept: Brand Sense takes the next step from study results to outline a six-step program for bringing brand building into modern times. Examples cover products and retail marketing alike, demonstrating the basics of establishing an appealing marketing approach based on more than sight and sound alone. 
 I'm a 9th grade Algebra 2 student, and we're using this book in our class for homework problems. However, my teacher, yet extremely nice and smart as she is, sometimes has little time to teach new material because we're often short on time. Also, sometimes I just can't see the board and so I just don't see her pointing to the numbers when she says things like, "and then you move this here". Therefore, when I do my homework, occassionally I find that I have very limited knowledge on how to do the problems! But the examples giving in front of each section teach me how to do everything, and right now in Algebra 2, I have a 96% (hoping to raise it to over 97 so I can skip PreCalc and go to AP Calc next year). It is also very good to skim over the chapters before a test, and I find myself willing to carry it to and from school everyday, despite it being 2 kg =)  If you're seeking to learn Algebra 2 by yourself,  I would recommend this book but warn you that it is better when accompanied by a course. For example, it doesn't cover expanding by minors when introducing matrix determinants, which I find to be much more useful than just cross multiplying. But overall, the content is very good.  (Hint: Don't read the passages to learn how to solve a problem, but look at the examples, and model your problem based on the example. That way you'll remember and absorb more =) 
 I first read Dr. Moody's collection of near-death experiences in the mid-1980s when death was only an academic subject for a thiry-something person. I was fascinated by the accounts he and pediatrician Melvin Morse had collected from patients and felt a sense of reassurance that the compiler was a scientist. These reports changed my outlook on life. Now, about two decades later, it makes it easier to accept a most shattering loss, the passing of my partner and husband of 33 years. However, I'm more drawn now, not to the accounts of "tourists," who have gone and come back, but the permanent residents whom mediums like George Anderson have interviewed 
 The book Blue Willow is about a girl named Janey. She was sad and had a friend name Lupe. Janey had to move a lot and she had a plate that reminded her about her great-great grand father. When she moved she had to leave the plate behind. She saw a place that remind her of the plate.    I think that the book is trying to tell you about hard work.  It's hard work  moving to a different house. The author's purpose is to entertain you, so you could read more of it because it's a good book.  My opinion about the book is that other kids should read it, because it's a super good book to read. I like it because her teacher was kind and friendly. Janey couldn't see her friend Lupe so she has to meet new friends. My favorite part  of the story is that Janey caught a horned toad.      
 I loved this book. I think it is my all time favorite, though I need to give it more time to sink in.  In this review I would rather talk about an issue that deeply confused me when reading this book: there are two versions out.  My first copy, which I purchased new at a Barnes and Noble had 351 pages, my second copy had exactly 400. The difference is a chapter called "An Interruption" narrated by one of the characters, which was about 50 pages long, and goes from page 250 to 300. Many say that this passage severely alters the story, but I believe it is really just affirming that the book is fiction, and making a joke about the connections people make with the book and his personal life. I don't want to say any more because I don't want to spoil it however, I feel that it is not really an important passage either way.  This was especially confusing to me because I believed that all paperbacks had the alteration, however, they don't. Both say "Vintage Books First Edition July 2003" and both books contain a note that the text was altered from the original version; however both do not contain the interruption.  I do not know which version Amazon.com is selling as it claims the book has 368 pages while that number differs from both of my copies.  Either way this is a great book. I read it first without the interruption, and I think it may read best if you skip it, then read it at the end, as another Amazon reviewer suggested. It almost seems as if the tone of that part expects you to have read the whole story. However, it is not my place to question the work of a genius like Eggers so maybe we should read it the way he (eventually) intended. 
 This book has been attacked by many foolish people. This book will tell you the truth about the middle east. Nearly all arabs today are the slaves of murderous dictators. These dictators hate freedom. They teach their children from birth to hate freedom and destroy it.   What has happened in the middle east has happened not because Sharansky was wrong, but because he was exactly right. When America tried to give freedom to Iraq, every not free country in the region lined up to stop it from happening. Rather than the war to free Iraq being a mistake, America's mistake was in not bringing freedom to Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Lebannon, the arabs of Judea/Samarea/Gaza and the rest.   The more America tries to spread freedom, the harder the forces who hate freedom will fight to stop it. We cannot get peace though empowering gangsters. Arafat turned his people into animals and the world accepted it in the name of peace. The only way to bring freedom is to eliminate evil and teach the people real freedom.  
 The truth can be more shocking than fiction, and here's the ultimate political thriller. And it's all true. This powerful memoir details how Woodward and Bernstein, as young reporters covering bland local issues, got the opportunity of a lifetime to unhatch a story of vast political corruption and unethical dirty tricks (known loosely as Watergate), and they directly started the domino effect that eventually toppled President Richard Nixon and got many of his cronies thrown in the slammer. In addition to crucial information on the scandal itself, this book is also an invaluable look into the process of investigative journalism, and how reporters cultivate their sources and follow up on obscure leads that can break out into a huge story. Note that the book can be hard to follow in places, especially in regards to the names of the many Washington conspirators involved. This is more of an issue with Watergate itself, rather than Woodward and Bernstein's writing, because the scandal was just too huge for anyone's comprehension. You will find yourself continually looking back to the cast of characters that the authors have helpfully placed at the front of the book. And finally, this book is a crucial vindication of the true necessity of a vigorous free press in America. Kudos to Woodward, Bernstein, and all of their courageous colleagues for exposing this ultimate arrogance of power and the damage it did to the American democratic process. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 This short impressionistic account of Iraq and the war seems to close the case on a bungled job. As the United States went to war amidst a massive protest movement, the appearance of imperialistic motive seemed apparent to most. But as the author tells it, he arrived in Iraq to find many relieved to see the American miliatry shuck off the burdern of Saddam. Thence, from this window of opportunity we see the rapid progression to its opposite, and the swift disillusion of Iraquis with the leaden American initiative, obviously unable from the beginning to keep its crypto-imperialistic obsessions in tow. The result is the now dismal endgame of what might have actually given substance to the initial rhetoric of liberators. 
 Very good picture quality and the cable itself is very robust. Outer diameter of each is about 1/4". Very good deal at this price 
 I'm only giving this 5 stars because the actual recordings are priceless. However I'm telling you now. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM  This is stolen goods and the recordings that are on this cd are not even of the finest quality.  This is purely a commercial album released by the record company without the permission of Jack Off Jill's members. And thus they recieve no royalties for the selling of this album.   Fear not though. you can get the tracks off this album completely free and in better quality.   Agent Moulder of Jack Off Jill has remastered and released them on her website for your downloading pleasure.   you can find them here:  t-c-r.net/jojmusic   while you are there check out and support her new band TCR, and their new album 'The Chrome Recordings'.

 This book is perfect as either an introduction to Walker Percy's thought or as a final collection of essays for the longtime fan.  "Signposts" is the only book available that provides Percy's writing from virtually every stage of his life, including the period when he was completely unknown.  That fact alone makes it worth the purchase 
 All anyone has to do is look at the census results to know that the outcome of this story is becoming a reality in Europe, although it is taking much longer 
 When a friend was recently going through a rough time, I loaned her the whole series of Grafton's Kinsey Millhone books.  My friend told me they allowed her to escape from the stress until she could handle it better.  Unfortunately, she also told me that Kinsey has replaced me as her best friend 
 WARNING: 10 SECONDS OF ANY SOLO ON THIS CD MAY MAKE YOU DOWNRIGHT VIOLENT! HERE'S THE FACTS FOLKS: GUITAR WATSON IS A SLOPPY SHRED MASTER OF THE HIGHEST ORDER. HE CAN MAKE FOOLS LIKE JOE SATRIANI LOOK PLAIN SILLY! IN A 1992 RADIO INTERVIEW FRANK ZAPPA WAS ASKED TO LIST HIS DESERT ISLAND ALBUMS, THE VELOURS AND  "Three Hours Past Midnight" WERE THE ONLY TWO NON-CLASSICAL TITLES ON A 16 ALBUM LIST. WHEN ASKED TO NARROW IT DOWN TO ONLY ONE ALBUM, HE SAID [WITHOUT HESITATION] " Three Hours Past Midnight " BY JOHNNY GUITAR WATSON. IF THAT AIN'T ENUFF FOR YA, THIS SUCKER HAS AN ENTIRE ALBUM'S WORTH OF EXTRA TRACKS SHUFFLED IN! CAN YOU DIG IT 
 That this book is a classic should come as a surprise to no one, so my reveiw is strictly based on the audio version. I first read this novel years ago but recently listened to the tapes on a long car ride with my children. The reader did an excellent job and the story kept us all interested. I recommend this as a great way for a family to share a classic. 
 The index fund is that great thing that no one has discovered.  The idea of the index fund is to get around the fees of the mutual fund but still offer the investor protection against loses in individual stocks by spreading the investment over an entire inudstry or index or country.  So one can buy an index that tracks small caps, or oil or Israel or the Dow.  Almost everything is indexed these days.  The idea that is that by spreading the risk one can gain the 10% a year average S and P gains that have been the norm since 1930.  This book is a good introduction to understanding value investing and why to stay away from the high fees of mutual funds.  A really interesting and brilliant little book, that truly should beat the market, or at least achieve similar results.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 "Piece of Mind" is Tela's debut album and it was recorded while he was on Suave House (later he moved to Rap-A-Lot Records). And like all the albums by this label, it's a classic. The production is on a whole new level, beats that you'll hear nowhere else (Handled by Jazze Pha and Mo-A-Suave productions). They have an R&B feel to them, but don't get the wrong impression - it's down-south rap at the highest level. And so is Tela's rapping. His style is different, he's gota very smooth voice and his flow is unstopable. On some songs he's laid back and on others his rapper has a hard edge. Lyrically he'also much better than most rappers in the game. In fact, he reminds in so many ways of his label-mates, the Memphis rap pioneers Eightball & MJG. Yet he remains special in his own way. On the album you get impressive guest appearences by all Suave House artists - Crime Boss, Mr. Mike, O.C., Eightball, MJG (on one of the albums many highlights "Sho Nuff") and all the rest of them. It's an album you can play from the beginning to the end without skipping even one track. On this remastered edition you get two bonus songs, but you can only play the second one ("Riders" which is one of the best). The first one is recorded in a very poor quality, you can barely hear it (and it's a just a different version of track # 3 Tired of Ballin'). Bottom line - one of the best albums to come out from the South. It's one of those albums that just make you feel good, it really relaxes you. It's some playa... with a gangsta twist. Don't sleep on Tela, he always comes out with much heat 
 This is not an easy book.  Don't pick it up if you like pop novels and sci-fi.  It's for the serious reader of history, military tactics, and social upheaval.  Da Cunha is a brilliant observer of the 1896-97 Brazilian military's crushing of an ostensibly revolutionary movement in the dry interior.  Brutal, honest, clear, incisive.  An amazing and challenging book 
 I'm a photonut. Even more so with my latest DC gadget.  This book is a terrific resource for me - previous books discuss digital photography from an old media (chemical film) perspective. With my latest dual-mode camera, I wanted to master lighting, framing, click to clicks and feature adjustments quickly. This book helped me out alot, and comes highly recommended as a companion to your next digital camera purchase (regardless of the grade camera you buy).  - GiddyupGuy 
 Jim Highsmith's book Agile Project Management is so important to project and product managers that I have included it as a must read in my syllabus for Adaptive Project Management (MBA Technology Management Program, Westminster College, Salt Lake City, UT).    Jim's belief and practice in extending agile methods and practices into the product management world opens business functions like marketing, finance, sales and obviously product developement/operations to a new way of thinking and operating.  What Goldratt did for manufacturing, Jim Highsmith could be doing for intellectual development.  Contact David Spann at cc@ditell.co

 Little lost robins, ghastly goblins, and a grandmother's home-cooked meal  delight Little Bear during a visit to his grandparents' house.  Minarik's  easy reader book features short chapters with simple sentences and a large  typeface; the beautiful illustrations expand upon the storyline while  providing a moderate level of text support. Never-ending rows of  knick-knacks, perpetual laps to sit upon, and ceaseless supplies of  home-baked goods enchant Little Bear as he soaks up the love around him  like a sponge.  Sendak's simple, yet descriptive ink drawings further  engage readers in this refreshing tale; they are indeed worthy of the  Caldecott Honor Book award which decorates the cover.  This book is ideal  for both upper and lower elementary school readers.  Its four chapters are  episodic, making them perfect stopping points for the lower elementary  school reader.  Moreover, when read in its entirety, Little Bear's Visit  provides the older child with a large sense of accomplishment.   Grandfather's campfire-ghost tale may potentially frighten even older  readers; however, a clear use of foreshadowing and an explicit, upbeat  resolution sufficiently reassure young readers while maintaining older  children's excitement.  Relevant to children across cultures, Little Bear's  Visit uses hugs and loving words in order to effectiely model tender  adult-child realtionships.  This charming chapter narrative for beginning  readers will give Little Bear a special place in the hearts of young  children everywhere 
 Great book, easy reading.  Hard to put down.  
 Dr. James Duncan's Owls Of The World provides a comprehensive species-by-species portrait of some 200 owl species around the world. The inclusion of many lesser-known species located in smaller, more specific geographic locations contrasts nicely with feature of the more popular species, making for a well-rounded natural history of the evolution of owls throughout the world 
 Dr. Levine shows herself to be as paradoxical a character as the protagonist she writes about. What Dr. Levine doesn't seem to understand is that greater scholarship does not necessarily solve nor cure anti-Semitism. John Paul Sartre so eloquently articulated in "Portrait of an Anti-Semite," hate is an emotion - and not based on reason. Sartre was careful not to make the same mistake as Plato who said that virtue is knowledge, knowledge is virtue. History, past and present, has many examples of how knowledge can be used for devious means.  Dr. Levine does deserve some credit, however, for viewing the world with unwarranted optimism. Unfortunately, her ideal is not supported by the realities around us.   Dr. Levine so desperately wants to believe that if people are informed, their actions will do justice to the Supreme Being. Not so, Dr. Levine. History and our daily experiences contradict this premise. Moreover, it's not what people profess that is important - but their actions.   Despite my criticism, I believe that Dr. Levine has opened a worthwhile dialogue that should be given thoughtful consideration. (Jerry Marcus is the author of  "The Last Pope" and "The Salvation Peddler." 
 THe food items listed above are just a few of the treats and libations the survivors of the shipwreck of the Commerce had to eat in their lengthy forced trek across the Sahara DEsert in the 1800's. They also endured slavery, starvation, intense heat and thirst, and the strange customs of their captors. But like any good adventure/survival story, the suffering of the participants is only part of the picture. THIs book's vivid  portrayal of life in the Sahara and the communistic principles of the Bedouins that live there is riveting reading. By the end of the book one is sympathetic to both the sufferings of the captives and the shifting loyalties of their Muslim captors. Indeed, both the reader and the sailors become victims of the Stockholm Syndrome, whereby one becomes sympathetic to the plight of your captor, despite your own travails.  I've read hundreds of adventure stories. both modern and historical, and this is one of the best, combining adventure, history, sociology and geography in a thoroughly riveting tale of suffering and redemption. Tales where those who must endure are doing it as part of legitimate scientific, commercial or other interests are always more compelling than those adventure stories based on mere adrenalin or adventure seeking participants who stumble into disaster. HIghly recommended 
  Restored to its original 180 minute roadshow length (including overture and exit music), George Stevens' CinemaScope production of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK (1959, Fox) is a deeply moving and superbly acted movie experience.  Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett adapted their Broadway show, with a brilliant Joseph Schildkraut  (Otto Frank) and Gusti Huber (Mrs. Frank) repeating their stage roles.  Added to a great cast are a very poignant and natural young Millie Perkins as Anne, Oscar winner Shelley Winters, Oscar nominee Ed Wynn in a bitter dramatic role, Diane Baker, and Richard Beymer as Anne's boy friend.  It is heartrending material--a German Jewish family hiding out from the Nazis for two years in a Dutch attic, with Anne keeping a daily diary that was curiously ignored by the Nazis and has become one of the most important Holocaust documents.  (Maybe the same God who unforgivably let Anne and her sister die in a concentration camp only one month before war's end helped hide her diary for posterity.)  Location filming was done in the actual Amsterdam attic, with the real Otto Frank as technical advisor.  The Oscar-winning B&W art direction re-creates the actual two story attic interior to perfection (on huge Fox sound stages), and Oscar-winning cinematographer William Mellor (PEYTON PLACE) worked miracles to make wide CinemaScope compositions look cramped and claustrophobic. Producer/director Stevens gives it all a nail-biting tension, even though we know the grim outcome because of the powerful opening and closing framing device.  Bonus material is outstanding--a feature-length documentary "Echoes From the Past." new interviews with George Stevens, Jr. (who was second-unit director in Amsterdam) and a still-beautiful 66 year old Millie Perkins, and Movietone Newsreel footage.  You will need two evenings for this film masterpiece that was nominated for eight Oscars the same year as SOME LIKE IT HOT, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, BEN-HUR, and ANATOMY OF A MURDER.  That was some movie year!  DIARY OF ANNE FRANK is an unforgettable Holocaust drama and movie experience when you have a three hour time slot.  
 To the reviews that are complaining about the guinea pigs features being wrong-  Who cares!!!  It is a child's toy and unless your child is as anal as you then they are not going to care if it has a tail when it shouldn't.  I picked up this set at Toy's R Us for $4.00 and it is worth every penny.  My daughters love these little animals.  And they give you 2 different animals because variety is good.  It's not like your child will be pretending that the animals are mating!  Grow up 
 Mad Max purists don't care for this one, but I think it's underappreciated 
 "Falling Off the Bone" is filled with multi-textured, deeply melodic humor with psychedelic overtones. Some have said this is Todd's futuristic concept album.  In truth, "Bone" is folkier than "Medium Energy," but it is still rooted in posturing and excess, as evidenced by "Michael Jackson and Jose" and "Malaysian Restaurant."  This is not to say that Todd has abandoned his relentlessly hypnotic sound. Slicker synth-driven cuts like "I Heart Roe vs. Wade" have plenty of feral wail in them.  And the vocal harmonies of "Scotland" and the beautifully sprawling "Australia" are additional high points, but there's nary a duff track on the album.  Plus, if you listen to "Bone" on an iPod you will hear it in Blue yster Cult-like surround sound, a lightening bolt of high-end sonics.  
 Any new project I have, this is the first book to come out. It's great for everything from inspiration to seeing colors put together to working with clients!   I personally love color and am able to just look at swatches and figure out what I want and what goes good together; however, most of my clients are intimidated by everything from color to fonts, etc. This book makes it easy and fun to sit with them to pick colors. This is a friendly book and it takes the intimidation away from looking at color swatches.  My only complaint with this book is that the Pantone conversations in the back of the book are no where near accurate. Use the book for its strengths and get the conversations from PhotoShop and save yourself a lot of headaches 
 If you are looking for the classic party greats, buy this c.d.  I used it for my kids' Halloween party.  It was great 
 This book changed my life forever!  I found it at the airport bookstore, while en-route to making a life-changing move from LA to Maui, Hawaii!  It's been a fixture on my desk ever since, as a constant reminder that we possess pure potentiality to achieve anything in life we want.  Best part, its so easy to read, yet amazingly profound 
 Excellent handbook for the serious watercolorist.  Robert Wade has a great approach to some of the more difficult aspects of painting with watercolor.  He is brief, to the point, yet his explanations make sense!  Enjoyable reading and a great reference tool 
 I am among those who describe J. D. Salinger as America's least-heard-from, most-missed-author.  I don't know why he stopped writing.  Maybe he thought he had said all he had to say.  And in these "Nine Stories," he certainly said it all, and so eloquently.  My favorite three stories are (in descending order):  "A Perfect Day for Bananafish"; "After the War with the Eskimos"; and "Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes."  "Bananafish" speaks for itself.  After reading "Franny and Zooey" (certainly the most brilliant treatise on Christianity ever written, my apologies to C. S. Lewis) and "Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters", I understood why certain people (like Seymour Glass) are just too beautiful for this world.  "After the War with the Eskimos" can't help but touch the heart of anyone who ever loved Holden Caulfield.    "Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes" inspired me to write a story which, I fear, is terribly derivitive.  My characters sound a lot more like "The Sopranos" than J. D.'s upper-crusty New Yorkers, but the pathos is the same.  Salinger understands the human heart.  Maybe that's why he is so silent 
 Mireille Guiliano does an even better job in this latest book than she did in "French Women Don't Get Fat." While reading, I kept thinking about how many readers will be able to "see" themselves in the kind of unconscious eating/living she describes.  To me, if there is one essential lesson to be taken from this book, it is this: SLOW DOWN and begin to live  and eat CONSCIOUSLY. It won't really cost you anything to do so, and it may just melt some unwanted  pounds from your body. And, if it DOES cost you a little bit more in money, is it worth that to have a LOT more in health, slimness, and enjoyment of life?  Good reading that teaches us a lot about good living! 
 I would have to say this is one of my favorites!! I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and while Message in a Bottle will always be my favorite, this runs a close second along with A Walk to Remember :)  I would definitely recommend this book, it is certainly a page turner!! I must demand a sequel!!! 
 I recently purchased this item here, and I was so very impressed. It drastically improved the quality of my dvd player.  You know the difference in quality when you switch from watching regular tapes (vhs) to dvd?   Well, it is the same "step" when you watch dvds with s-video, as watching dvds with s-video.  My son said his Playstation 2 looked 10 times better with this s-video cord.  It is definatetly worth the money!  Highly recomended 
 This is an extraordinary book to prepare the board. Simple,concise, to the point. I upgraded from the second edition and it was really worth the upgrade. New chapters and new presentation with key concepts and case discussion worth reading. All time companion book ! 
 This collection is a very interesting story with some good originality in it. go for it but do not bother with the last 2 books . they are really another story and not so good as the first three books 
 Since September 11, I've been looking for any book out there to tell me about Arab audiences and what they watch. With the pervasive power of modern communication, media are helping shape the way we see ourselves, others and conflict. I found what I was looking for in this book. A well-written and courageous review of the hottest and most contested TV network on earth, this book leaves no stone unturned. I commend the authors particularly for their critique of the "Clash of Civilization" which seems to have taken over all our debates on the Middle East. I recommend this book for anyone who is confused about the turmoil in the Middle East and wants a refreshing optimistic view of how communication can bridge gaps rather than create the 
 This cute little board book was quick to become a favorite in our ELMO-LOVING household.   Filled with scenes of the Sesame Street gang in familiar settings, your child will love hearing you read the simple rhymes on each page, i.e., "Bert loves pigeons, and pigeons love to coo.  Can you guess who Elmo loves?  Elmo loves you!"     The story explains how everyone and everything loves something, from babies loving noise and toys, to penguins loving the snow.   The adorable pages will come to life and you'll find your child returning to this book just to pick out all their favorite things like Big Bird and Grover in the swimming pool, Ernie playing the drums, and other favorite characters shopping with Mommy in the grocery store.  This book was mainly advertised in book stores for Valentine's Day, but it really is appropriate any time, teaching children about love all year round 
 This book is a description of the practices of Tibetan Buddhism found by David-Neel during her tenure in Tibet during the early part of the Twentieth Century.  David-Neel had spent many years living in Tibet and studying Buddhism before she wrote this book, even adopting a Tibet son, Lama Yongden.  This book describes the main beliefs and ceremonies of Tibetan Buddhism as David-Neel observed them at that time.    The first sentence of the text reminds us that her task is practically unachievable "To present to Westerners a perfectly clear and complete idea of the mysticism of the Tibetans is practically impossible."  David-Neel was remarkably cognizant of the immensity of the cultural differences that she was trying to bridge, far more so that many other travel writers of her era.  Her fluency in the language and spiritual commitment helped her gain a foothold in the mysterious city of Lhasa, closed at that time to all foreigners-except her.  In this book, David-Neel takes on a variety of topics, including: Tibetan mysticism, kinds of initiations and their meanings, daily spiritual exercises, a historical overview of the Dalai Lamas, types of Buddhism, morality in Tibetan Buddhism, meditation and the cultivation of attention, and the Tibetan intelligentsia.  To capture some of the essence of Tibetan mystics, David-Neel terms them "spiritual sportsmen," referring to the boldness of the Tibetan mystics and "their singular impatient desire to measure their strength against spiritual obstacles or occult foes."  As she describes some of the types of initiation, these ideas become more clear.  For example, in one initiation, the initiates demonstrate their determination to exercise mind over matter as they sit naked for hours in the cold and swallow a four-inch long burning candle.  Later in the book, she stresses that the initiation is "not intended to communicate knowledge, but rather to transmit the power to do some physical or mental act."    The workings of the subconscious mind are extremely important to these mystics, and David-Neel tells us how the mystics use the study of sleep and dreams to determine intent, where it can be studied free from the constraints of conscious action.  In their beliefs, a person who dreams he murdered someone is guilty of murder because the dream shows his or her true intent.  In contrast, a person can actually kill someone and not be guilty of murder, if  he or she had no personal motive in the affair.  It is intent, and solely intent, upon which the system of morality is based.  This book is not intended to be a guide or introduction to the Buddhist faith, although it does include material summarizing some sacred Buddhist texts.  Buddhists are very diverse in their beliefs, and while a number of the statements David-Neel includes are familiar to all Buddhists, some of the practices described here would be abhorrent to many, and may be quite different in modern practice, even in Tibet.  As a historical  document, however, the book is fascinating in its description of the ceremonies, initiations, and beliefs of Buddhist mystics in early Twentieth Century Tibet. 
 First of all, that 5-star rating is to counterbalance the idiot who gave the album 2 stars simply because Amazon had no samples up yet; I would have given this album 3 stars if not for that.  The score itself is a mixed bag that often sounds more like Mark Snow than James Horner, and it counterbalances a melodic yet uneasy main theme with a liberal dose of metal clangs and electronics. The electronics are very harsh, and the tracks that feature them can be nigh unlistenable because of it. Still, though, that main theme is addicitve, and is worthy of being put on a compilation somewhere. This album is probably for fans of the movie and fans of James Horner only 
 Frampton Comes Alive 2 is a superb performance from three quarters(only the drummer changed) of the band that appears in the critically acclaimed "Live In Detroit". Althought the picture quality and video production of "Detroit" is superior, "2" is an excellent performance and a must have for fans of great music. Highly recommended. 
 I read and put into practice these 9 steps and they actually worked in spite of all my efforts to make them not work!  The book is an excellent tool and shows very practical and simple ways to get your financial life back in order...Read it, and then re-read it...memorize some passages and you will be on the road to financial freedom before you know it!  I highly recommend it 
 I love all of Jayne Ann Krentz's "personalities."  This historical novel from the Victorian era is terrific from start to finish!  First up in a "fog-shrouded graveyard" at midnight, Annie Petrie meets with a stranger who hides in the shadows and is a "private inquiry" specialist.  Her younger sister is dead from drowning in the baths where she worked and Annie suspects foul play.  Ambrose Wells, the mystery man, agrees to help her.  Next we find Concordia Glade, a teacher, and her four young women charges at Aldwick Castle where a second explosion has just taken place and the castle is on fire.  They use the confusion to escape having to defend themselves from one villain as they make their way to the stable.  Concordia and her charges who are orphans have come to the conclusion that the two men who run the castle are going to auction the young ladies off, possibly as high-priced courtesans!!  As they go to leave the stables, the villain's companion appears and tries to stop them but a stranger comes out of the shadows and knocks him out with two quick chops.  He states that Concordia is the "teacher" and they must all hurry to safety.  This is, of course, Ambrose Wells.  They get to an inn and Concordia and Ambrose send the girls to bed while they discuss what was going on at Aldwick Castle and why Ambrose was there.  Ambrose becomes their protector as they had for London and Concordia becomes Ambrose's partner as they further investigate both their mysteries which have managed to combine!  Lots of very fun secondary characters including the young women, plot turns, romance and comic relief!  A very enjoyable read 
 I dare say that Robert Fisk has seen modern war up close in all its ugly forms more than any soldier and certainly more than any of the leaders who cause these wars. And he has come to loathe what he has seen and have contempt for those who bring about these horrors and sympathy for the innocent who suffer the results. The book is difficult to read because of the details of the horrors and the betrayals of innocence and the record of man's inhumanity to his fellow man. Contrary to what some say he does have some heroes and they are the little people, the soldiers who showed humanity under difficult circumstances and civilians who did not lose their humanity. Anyone who has a romantic or patriotic view of war should read this book 
 Medici Effect is a good read that leads you into a journey of how innovation really occurs. It is the intersection of different fields, cultures, discplines, activities, people, etc. that leads you to a new direction for whatever problem that you are trying to solve. It strives to tie it all together in the end with the idea that you have to know what the problem is that you are trying to solve, seek out different experiences, people, etc. to give you new ideas to put together with the ideas that you already have in your head and voila - in 1 month to 8 years or more - an answer to the problem that you are trying to solve may happen. It is not a book about process - it is a book about the journey that may lead you to the solution that you are seeking 
 four rooms is gold 
 The book'll keep you reading and thrilling till almost the end. The story is as real as it could be. The problem is that you really won't know why the abductor did what it did and that is a flaw in this excellent book 
 This is one of the most purely enjoyable books I have ever read, Zweig writes very well and at times brilliantly in creating characters both psychologically consistent and vivid. This is one of a rare type of novels that offers thrilling, page turning excitement combined with emotional and intellectual depth. Beware of Pity is not the most subtle, or beautiful book I have ever read but I can't tell you any other that was more of a pleasure to read 
 I enjoyed listening to this work quite often in college and still replay it in my mind at times.  Get lost in your imagination and add your own playing if your mind can handle it 
 Others have written segments of the United States involvement in Laos while Roger Warner has brought forth the detailed historical accounts written by those who lived them into an interpolation of the events as they occurred. Anyone who participated in the operations which took place in  Laos will completely enjoy this wonderful account and glean a great deal of  informative information concerning the events which took before and after  their tour of duty.

 Excellent biography of a forgotten man and his times - a man that changed the way Americans collected European art. Funny, witty and appallingly honest. A must read for anyone serious about art buying 
 This is like one of the best kids' movies!!! I loved it when I first saw it when I was at about age 10 or 11. It's got a bunch of young boy actors including the real life brothers who play brothers, Michael and Jimmy Galeota. They are one of my fave kid actors. Michael you may remember from the Saterday morning show Baily Kippers' P.O.V that sadly got canceled a few years ago. Michael is now 17, he played in this movie at age 12, Jimmy is now 14 and played in this movie at age 9, hes so hot! This movie is a mystery movie for kids. It's about a club of 4 boys, about 12 yrs old, plus tag along younger brother Cade (Jimmy Galeota) who play detectives and try to figure out whats going on with their mysterious next door neighbor by sneaking into his house when hes not home. It's a way great movie, trust me! Overall, I think you would like it! bye 4 now 
 One of the best... Completely whacky & Wodehousian. Jane Opal is one of my favorite PGW girls 
 I'm grateful to the author for taking us around the world giving us clear examples of demonic activity. These aren't just words on a page. This is the best explanation I've heard regarding why demons inhabit areas and how they operate 
 Of all novels that have galloped out of John Grisham's closet,"The King of Torts" must rank as one of his best. This is a novel that invokes a chiselled language and portrays life to its near perfected harshness;a book where there's a very narrow scope of sentimentality and emotions to be more than just fringe players and one where meanderings from the mainstream idea is but a prohibited parameter. "The King of Torts" is a novel which looks at life as it is and reflects it as it is;it is the common story of how hunger for fame,fortune and success can erode moral aflictions;it is a tale of a stroke od good luck pulling down a person to the depths of conscientous and financial ruins.  "The King of Torts" is a book firmly focused on the moral decay and rampant corruption that the legal inatitution has consciously leapt into. John Grisham traces several months in the life of Clay Carter,a young public defender whose moral conviction and honest structure of job plan is dealt a blow by the undeniably powerful hand of money. As the author takes us on a roller-coaster ride with Clay,we can feel ourselves actively involved in the plethora of transactions that the protagonist of the novel engages himself in and as the journey becomes more and more bumpy,we can feel the heat of life itself.   Five years into this profession and Clay has relinquished all hopes and expectations of ever leaving behind the lowly-paid,relative obscure onus of a public defender. The city of Washington is getting even more exasperating for him to breathe as his girlfriend's parents are looking for a new man for their daughter to marry. Rebecca Bennett too is getting fidgety and wants Clay either to accept the extended hand of help of her parents or be damned. Clay refuses to oblige and loses a major fraction of his better self. And when every feature of his life seems to conspire to dash Clay's back against the wall,a silver lining arcs itself across a dark sky.  Clay takes up a pretty humdrum and unglamorous task of defending Tequila Watson,a 20-year-old black male accused of killing a man on a street in Washington DC. To Clay this appears just one of the myriad senseless killings that are carried out across Washington every day. But a very much routine investigation into Tequila Watson's past and background seems to contain several lost pages and an equal number of loopholes. and then arrives Max Pace onto the scene offering untold riches and a place amongst the revered community in the twinklng of an eye should Clay resort to tort litigations,cease to look into Tequila Watson's issue and solve the case outside court. Clay has simply to keep mute on a secret and he could realise his age-old dream of possessing an independent law firm.  As Clay accepts this offer and from being just a peripheral figure in the battle of torts in the beginning,the central character in this superbly crafted John Grisham novel becomes the "king of torts". He becomes a renowned figure in the public eye,a hero really. But luck rotates in wheels and so inevitably Clay falls down from CLoud 9 to a bed of thorns. Clay never recovers and is entangled further and further into a web of legal mess and loses his way completely out of it. Money is want Clay once craved for and money is what he gets and money is what distorts the design of his life.  From a young lawyer exhausted of his unpromising position to an overnight millionaire.....this is the fairytale that Clay Carter lives for the space of more than a year. But wealth and power are not eternal but morals and sound princiles are and Clay realises this basic truth in the crudest fashion under the sun. His rise is meteoric and his downfall equally spectacular but John Grisham's portrayal of the character Clay Carter is really a microcosm. Himself a former lawyer,Grisham doesn't find putting himself into the shoes of the lead actor in this drama that tough and neither is one of the most prolific writer in contemporary time inept at showcasing the dire corruption that has seeped into law and which dissolves youthful idealism in no time. Characters such as Mulrooney,Patton French and Saulsberry---whom the author paints so marvellously with the shade of reality---are overlapping in the aspect that all these lawyers resort to tort litigation to make fast money without paying no regard to teir original profession. Indeed it is Grisham's sardonic view of the legal institution and the various elements there that is so overwhelingly captivating in this book. The kinds of lawyers who feature in this book are the true and fair images of their real-life counterparts and the added dimension of a very subtle language sharpened on the edge of a die-hard authrative ambition marks a massive onslaught on the undertakings that occur in the legal proffesion,and by extension in all the apparent noble callings. John Grisham's "The King of Torts" is a greatly satirical novel that etches reality into its own ereal-life colours and the final product is a picture that shattes the whole essence of law and jurisdiction 
 I just picked up my copy of this book today, signed by Sherry who I am proud to say I know personally. She is a VERY special individual and she has done a wonderful thing with this book. EVERYONE that has ever had a spouse deploy, or son, daughter, boyfriend or anyone else close to them, and even those who have not ever been in this situation, ALL can take something from this book. It is a quick reading book that can be shared with many. Way to go Sherry! You are someone that I KNOW was brought into my life for a reason. 
 Dayum, girl, you're so fine you're almost a black girl. I bet you holla! And dayum if you can't sing better than most black girls. You sure you're white? I think you might have a little dab of color in the mix, Pink 
 This is standard Koontz fare, elevated by wonderful local color in Kyoto.  It reads very much like a Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn intrigue/love story, the sort of thing Stanley Donen or Alfred Hitchcock would direct:  the heroine is suffering from inexplicable amnesia, and the hero is a spy whose loyalties are in doubt.  There's just enough suggestion of kinky weirdness to float it through  -  a bizarre character with metal hands, for instance.  It's a bit long for what it is, but it satisfies 
 _If I was to take one book along to an isolated beach or island this summer for a serious read and reflection this would be it. You'll end up feeling better about your self, because you'll end up feeling better about mankind. This book proves that people of all cultures and all times have had the capacity to transcend the commonplace and petty and know God. This is the "golden thread" that connects all mystical traditions, all true wisdom in the world.   _Inspite of the extensive footnotes, I would not consider this to be a scholarly book. Rather, I would consider it a spiritual book- that is why it has value and is worth the reading. Here is the mystic heart of native cultures, Taoism, Hinduism, Buddihism, Judaism, Classical Greece, Islam, and Christianity all in one beautifully designed book of 236 pages. What better use could you find for your reading time 
 For a "Best of" this album has a fantastic track list.  The sound quality is that great vintage "Pulp Fiction" surf rock sound that we have all grown to appreciate.  It's a BUY even if you have just the smallest of urges to listen to what this stuff is all about. Dick Dale is the godfather of this sound, that has become the staple of this form of rock 
 This was the album where people finally started to take notice of Gary Allan. On his third album, he seems to find his footing and some great songs. Not that his first two albums were bad, quite the contrary they are great, but this album has songs that really captured the attention of the public at large. On this album he does an excellent cover of "Runaway", one of the best I've heard. The title track is smoldering piece of country music that was a good hit from the album. "Right Where I Need To Be" was another top 10 hit for Allan, and the haunting ballad "Lovin You Against My Will" cracked the top 40. "Sorry" is a fun uptempo tongue-in-cheek kind of song. There's some great ballads like "Cryin For Nothin", "Don't Tell Mama", and a few others. Overall a really strong effort from Allan that remains as one of his best 
 I burned Big Star's first two records from a friend and felt incredibly disappointed. While I had huge expectations from reviews I'd read and talking to a few people, I was sorely disappointed. I thought the songs were often great, but I didn't get what the big deal is. In my opinion, the only songs that didn't sound derived from Byrds/Beatles rock sounded a bit crappy - especially the rockier stuff. I can understand why people like the stuff, but other than "September Gurls" it wasn't for me. I wrote them off as a good but overrated band.  Then I heard songs like "Big Black Car," "Kangaroo," "Take Care" and "Holocaust" and could barely believe my ears at the gorgeous, tired melancholy. If you want slick production or want more of the old Big Star, this is not your thing, but I prefer my productions a bit ragged at times because it ups the emotional factor. There are only a couple of songs here that don't strike me as perfect, most notably the POINTLESS inclusion of "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On." But ignoring that, I think that it may be one of the best albums ever. The amount of influence this has had on modern music can not be underrated. If the early Big Star did not impress you (or even if it did), please give this one a try 
 Johnson's defense of the real Jesus against the assaults of the Jesus seminar 
 The book wsa in the exact condition the seller listed it at, which was close to perfect. It was delivered fast, no problems at all 
 This book has very good helpful tips for any guy who is going to get married or dating as well. It talks about how to treat a women, in the house as well as out of the house. It tells us guys to be gentle and kind to our wife or girlfriend. It talks about how to better up our communcation with our girls, what and what not to say to them. This book helped me to see what I was doing wrong, and what to do better in my relationship. It was easy to read and to the point 
 One of the greatest books EVER written in the English language.  Period.  (Well, actually, it's four books, but they don't publish them separately anymore.)  FMF is a modernist genius in the order of a Faulkner or a Woolf,  with a beautiful style, incredibly human characters, and a mind-boggling  knowledge of both the human heart and the physical world.  FMF seems to be  as quasi-omniscient as his noble last Tory, the main character, Christopher  Tietjens.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that it's an easy  book.  Parade's End not a potboiler to read at the beach while you're  getting a tan and sipping margaritas.  It is a book that challenges the  reader to let go of expectation and any hope of conventional structure, and  to allow FMF's unique storytelling to settle into your gut slowly.  It is a  moral novel that doesn't moralize.  A book about what it is to be good, to  be a human being.  FMF's beautiful style is even exceeded by his love for  humanity and generosity of spirit. The sheer uncynicalness of the  book--especially in this hollow, cynical age--is like a balm on this  reader's eyes.  This is one of those books, like Sound & The Fury, like  Ulysses, like Pride & Prejudice, like Great Expectations, that EVERYONE  should read 
 This world-famous novel is all about love and loss and making choices in marriage. Adam loves Hetty who loves Arthur who is a scoundrel. Hetty gets pregnant by Arthur, who deserts her, despite Adam's efforts to save her. Later Adam marries Dinah, a serious, calm cousin of Hetty's, after his brother Seth unselfishly gives her up. Obviously, this summary is only the tip of the iceberg. Eliot is truthful, moving, intelligent, never dull--this is perhaps her best novel. (I liked it better than "Middlemarch.") Begin reading it and you won't be able to put it down--AND it will stay with you for a very long time afterward 
 This book is very funny, because Junie B. keeps saying, "My Grandpa pulled out my tooth!", and then her Grandpa says, "No, it came out when you bit my finger!"  Junie B. keeps saying, "911! 911! 911! Please help!" and then she runs out the door.  I like this book a lot cause it's so funny.  I like this book cause I'm a toothless wonder, too!  And she has a loose tooth in this book, and so do I.  Please read it 
 Out of a depth of biblical analysis and understanding, Brueggemann states that "the task of prophetic ministry is to nurture, nourish, and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture around us."  Brueggemann does not attempt to define the office of prophet in the charismatic sense.  He holds that prophetic ministry is that which is "under all the acts of ministry." 
 The Lobels' have introduced a very nice and unique cookbook with the release of this one.  I own several other grilling cookbooks, and there are many good ones out there.  This one is my absolute favorite because the  recipes are a little more than your basic grilled steak or hamburger. Try  the grilled filet mignon with gorgonzola-scallion compound butter and the  sirloin steak with rosemary brushed potatoes and red peppers.  Don't forget  to try the barbeque sauce.  It's fantastic.  The book's contents include  tips on grilling, burgers, beef and veal, lamb and pork, poultry, game and  game birds, and sauces, salsas, maranades, rubs and other condiments.   There are no fish recipes so if you are looking for that specifically, find  another cookbook.  If everything else sounds good to you, you will enjoy  this inovative book by the Lobels' 
 This little box has everthing I'll need to download pictures and connect to other devices.  I guess until USB 3.0 comes out. Very good 
 My 2 year old is relatively savvy when it comes to children's books, and he really enjoys the minimal language and simple drawings even though he often sits through much longer and more difficult fare.  It's precisely the simple message of the text that is illustrated so brilliantly in the lovely pictures and fine-tuned diction: imagination matters!  Our favorite picture is the robot-box / "This is not a box" page.  It's just hysterical to little ones.  A fun read for children and parents alike 
 For sheer excitement, you cannot beat this DVD.  The music is exciting, arranged well for brass ensemble, and recorded with high quality.  But that's only the beginning...  In Blast, the band vigorously acts out all the pieces they perform.  How they manage this energy level will flat-out amaze you.  I can honestly say that, after just seeing these performances, you are as happily exhausted as the performers must be.  Prepare to be thrilled.. 
 The Ziz and the Hanukkah Miracle is a clever attempt to explain the Hanukkah miracle of the oil that lasted eight days. This non-traditional story is a lighthearted whimsical fantasy about the Ziz, a nearsighted bird who longs for more light in the winter so that he can make his dinner. He sets out on a solitary journey to find light. He catches fireflies, lantern fish, and even attempts to capture the moon. Frustrated with his lack of success, he finally asks for God's help. God provides the Ziz with an oil lamp, which he greedily refuses to share with the other animals. When the Ziz discovers the menorah in the Holy Temple needs oil, he relents. With the help of the other animals, the menorah burns brightly. With his new friends by his side, the Ziz's oil lamp burns even brighter.  The Ziz and the Hanukkah Miracle is not a conventional Hanukkah story, but the value of friendship, working together, and even Tikkun Olam are nicely woven into the story. The illustrations are bold, colorful and full of light. Ages 3-7.  Barbara Bietz is a Jewish educator and freelance writer. Her work appears in numerous magazines and websites.

 I loved the movie and play when I saw them.  The music is so fun.  My girls (6 and 4 years old) love it too.  We all sing together 
 Harb is the best ski writer & teacher in the world, with the possible exception of his friend Lito Flores (see his books, videos & website titled Breakthrough on Skis).  The book is not real easy reading, but it is worthwhile plowing through it, and his theories and technique work.  If you are not interested in technique and knowing why methods work it's probably not for you.  There is also a PMTS website for discussion which you can find by Googling it. PMTS is Harald's method. The video is also good 
  In "A Series of Unfortunate Events #5: The Austere Academy," the Baudelaires are sent to live with Vice Principle Nero at the Prufrock Preparatory School while Mr. Poe tries to find them a new guardian. Unfortunately, they get treated miserably by the female bully known only as...Carmelita Spats! The children, at least, make some new friends in their new temporary home. Their friends - Duncan Quaqmire and Isadora Quaqmire - are triplets who also lost their parents AND their third sibling (Quiqley Quaqmire) in a fire. Too bad the fate the Baudelaires and the Quaqmires must suffer at the end of the book when they meet the religious Coach Genghis, as well as their two awful and weird teachers - Mr. Remora and Mrs. Bass. The best in the series so far, and the one you really need to buy! But beware: you'll probably hate Vice Principle Nero as much (if not more) than Count Olaf.. 
 "Less Than Angels" is full of classic Pym characters: the eccentric, Alaric Lydgate, who sits in the evenings with an African mask on and wishes it were permissable to wear it out in public; Rhoda Wellcome and  Mabel Swan, sisters, Rhoda given to peering at the neighbors from behind  lace curtains; Catherine Oliphant, a writer and spinster, but with a twist  she is living, unmarried with; Tom Mallow, one of many anthropologists in  the story. Readers of "Excellent Women" will enjoy the  reappearance of Esther Clovis and the references to Everard and Mildred  Bone. The men in this story have more character development than in  previous Pym novels. They are shown to be real people not so different form  their feminine counterparts. There is competition in this story, a  three-way competition for Tom Mallow's love, and a four-way competition for  the Foresight grants, for the study of anthropolgy. The competitions mirror  each other in subtle ways. Catherine is one of Pym's most endearing  characters. You really yearn for her to find happiness. This is one of my  favorites 
 A classic updated.  The first edition, written in 1978, has 8  ratings of 5 stars and one of 4 stars ("due to it's age") on Amazon.  As Six Sigma grew in popularity many more organizations discovered the power of design of experiments, as developed by Sir Ronald Fisher.  George Box, was his student.  He built on the ideas of Fisher and together with the other authors created a book that had already become the classic reference for designed experiments and how to apply statistics to improve results before the term "Six Sigma" was coined.  The new edition retains the clear and friendly writing style of the original and adds some new tools to the experimenters toolbox (as mentioned in the publishers text above).    I am biased as my father was one of the 3 authors of the original book and the second edition is dedicated to him.  Luckily, you don't have to take my word for it, many others regard this book as the primary resource for design of experiments.    Statistics for Experimenters is a tool that is used frequently (not a book gathering dust on the shelf) by many experimenters, engineers, Six Sigma experts and others as they use experiments to learn, innovate and improve 
 Its length obviously prohibits comprehensiveness, but this book is succinct and lively on the topics it does cover. Edward Craig does an admirable job of showing how some of even the most ancient philosophical questions are pertinent to a modern person's life. The writing style is accessible with little jargon. The bibliography is a fine starting point for further reading. A great read to augment a more thorough survey of Philosophy 
 The White Mountains is just the first in a trilogy of sci-fi adventrures aimed at young people. This classic trilogy was a childhood favorite of mine and I was fortunate enough to have rediscovered them. I re-read them after 20+ years and still find them to be engaging and really quite good.  The premise is that an alien race called the "Masters" have taken over earth, destroyed its great cities and control men's minds with a device called "the cap". All people are capped at age 14 and human beings live in small villages at a near-medieval leel of technology.  The main characters are Will, Henry, Beanpole and Fritz who are all young men who question the practice of capping and the presence of the Tripods - giant three-legged machines that enforce the capping and are worshipped by some and feared by the uncapped. These characters head off for the White Mountains (actually the Alps) where free men are rumored to live. Eventually the series focuses on the struggle of the free men (as they begin to recover some of mankind's lost knowledge and technology) versus the Masters.   During the boys' travels we get to see the author's vision of a destroyed world, especially Europe, and how mankind reacts to the imposed (brain-robbing) peace and harmony of the Masters. The Masters are truly alien - we have very little concept of their motivation, how their bodies work, their technology or their society. These are not your garden-variety Star Trek humanoid-style aliens, and I think that it one of its great strengths.  I give this trilogy an "A" 
 This book is an excellent compilation of feminist ideas couched as theories that you can share with the men in your life to ensure they leave you alone. Very alone. The chapter on yeast infections and the chemical composition of that "off" smell alone makes it a must read for any serious misandrist.  Seriously... pass this one by, but do get the bibliography. The book is a farce, but some of the papers it quotes are good science 
 This is definitly a must have book for a begining or a seasoned estimator 
 Nicholas Sparks, with every book he's ever written, has succeeded in making me cry. And so it is, with this book, I cried like my baby sister. I strongly recommend "Message In a Bottle", it will break you.   
 From dictionary.com:  Eclipse--1. The partial or complete obscuring, relative to a designated observer, of one celestial body by another. 2. The period of time during which such an obscuration occurs. 3.  A temporary or permanent dimming or cutting off of light.  4. A fall into obscurity or disuse; a decline.  5. A disgraceful or humiliating end; a downfall.  Montage and composition are among the many different ways to fashion a film, but this film takes those techniques and controls it to such a consummate level, it seems no similar attempt can be done again without it being a pale comparison.   Right from the beginning the idea of "eclipse" and bodies or objects obscuring other bodies or objects is used to a major degree, but with a such precise control over monochromatic black-and-white gradient scheme that each individual composition is powerfully effective.  The frame-within-a-frame technique, where everything in the world of this film exists in some form of composition or balance, has no parallel, except maybe with some of the modern day work by Wes Anderson... except Wes Anderson's sometimes pastel, sometimes bright color provides an entirely different effect.  This movie gives off a degree of science fiction, with such utter significance to framing and blocking off things towards the idea of obscurity that it doesn't seem to exist in our world, a world where we move aside to get out of the way, or focus on infinite planes of existence rather than many.  Not all the film is like this, of course, because we do have a story, and the story is about the ultimately doomed relationship of a stock market broker and a young woman who only fits in with the world of perpindicular obscured objects.  The stock market is chaotic and insane, and only follows composition when the girl is around.  The symbolism is beyond obvious, it hits you over the head with a wooden mallet--which is probably one of the reasons why some people might not like this, because it's very uncomfortable and impatient to watch.  Still, if you want to avoid becoming impatient and edgy around this film, my suggestion to you would be to turn off the sound and subtitles (if necessary).  The fact of the matter is that the only dialog that matters is disregarded (purposefully) by the characters and all the poignant questions and exchanges are ignored or unanswered.  This movie, in fact, could benefit a lot with a little LESS plot than it currently has, because the plot itself seems to get in the way of the majesty of the filmmaking proper.  Not that the plot isn't important.  It's just uncomfortable.  What's amazing about it, really, is that the from the woman's perspective, the world of strict order and composition is amazingly comfortable, but the desire to develop comes from the man, who's world is always moving and unbalanced.  So while the ultimate goal of the plot is about breaking down such composition (success being comedy and failure being tragedy), it's difficult to imagine the goal of the character impinging on the harmony the spectator enjoys.  What, precisely, are we supposed to get from this anyway?  That's "the thing."  The plot obscures the overall theme of the movie, a theme dealing with emptiness and fear of potential doomsday (the Cold War).  And once said obscured object becomes the focus of the camera, suddenly the plot is obscured itself.  This film is absolutely amazingly structured, though in a way that seems rather confusing because our technical expectations have us leaning more towards figuring out what the plot, dialog, and characters mean, not what they're completely distracting us from.  It seems a rather dangerous approach to filmmaking... what makes it amazing is that it works.  It's a technical achievement of consummate artistry, and that's a hard thing to say for a film that spends the majority of its time focusing on a plot one hates.  --PolarisDi 
 After reading several of Joyce Meyers books.  This one was very interesting.  I love to work with the hardback, the study guide and my Life Application KJV Bible.  I love the way the three connect.  Two phrases that caught my interest were, "Ask God to open your ears and sanctify them so you can be sensitive to His voice," and "We must learn to listen, for it is impossible to hear without listening."  When we take time to pray and listen for guidance & direction from God, we must realize that He speaks in many ways.  We need to learn how to listen with a servants heart and an attentive ear.  Ready to receive instruction.  Thank-you Joyce Meyers for sharing the many ways to hear from God.  
 In our electronic age, especially with the Internet, information can be disseminated more rapidly and more widely than ever before. So can misinformation. People hear a plausible and entertaining story about a word's origin and share it with others -- without bothering to check its validity.

 Regarding Iraq: "[I]t is incontestable that on the day I left office there were unaccounted-for-stocks of biological and chemical weapons." So said Bill Clinton in July of 2003 (on CNN). Why weren't they found then? Iraqi General Georges Sada offers an explannation in this book of his. On June 4, 2002, a three-mile-long irrigation dam collapsed n Syria. "Flood waters covered an area of nearly forty square miles." When "Syrian president Bashar al-Assad asked for help from Jordan and Iraq, Saddam knew what he would do. For him, the disaster in Syria was a gift, and there, posing as shipments of supplies and equipment sent from Iraq to aid the relief effort, were Iraq's WMDs. Weapons and equipment were transferred both by land and air."   Of the latter, General Sada, former air vice marshall in Saddam Hussein's military, says there were 56 flights of commercial Iraqi passenger aircraft from Iraq to Syria. They were "quickly reconfigured" "transforming the passenger planes into cargo planes" that were then used to transport "hundreds of tons of chemicals, armaments, and other paraphernalia into Syria under the cover of a mission of mercy to help a stricken nation." General Sada says the Syrian through whom the above was coordinated was General Abu Ali, a cousin of Bashar al-Assad. "For once in the long history of belligerence between Iraq and Syria, there was complete agreement between them." "They arranged for the operation to be conducted like a regular business deal, & everything was paid for, up-front and in cash." Sada knew Saddam; was brought out of retirement by Saddam after the Kuwaiti War. (A war during which Sada, albeit briefly, was arrested after refusing an order by Saddam's son Qusay.) Sada was regularly consulted thereafter. Sada remarks herein too how "Saddam had spread the idea that we didn't have to worry because nobody was going to attack us." Sada "had heard him say it many times." Sada telling Tariq Aziz (from London, where Sada had been sent as an emissary of Iraq) that the UK was going to hit Iraq, thus fell on deaf ears. Sada once also cautioned Saddam that trying to launch an air attack against an American aircraft carrier was hopeless. Moreover, Saddam wasn't aware of the capabiltities of cruise missiles until after Baghdad was struck by them during the 1991 Gulf War; having asked his air force commander: "tell me how it's possible that we were struck so hard without warnings of any kind. The air-raid sirens didn't even go off. How could his happen?" Saddam, of course, wasn't running a government, but a big crime family, a regime, in Sada's words, "not built on the basis of skill and efficiency," but "on the basis of blind loyalty to Saddam" wherein 2+2 was 9, or whatever subordinates thought Saddam wanted to think it was. Sada, by his own admission, however, "had a bad habit of saying that 2 plus 2 is four." Sada thinks he was able to get away with divulging unpleasant realities to Saddam owing to the fact that Sada was not a Muslim.  As an Assyrian Christian Sada could never be a power broker, or threat. Sada also details how Saddam was not at all hurt by sanctions; nor his loyalists, thanks to "the gift of the president," a bonus progam of Saddam's paid to Baathist Party members (4-5 million folks). Where did Saddam get the cash to buy this loyalty? Oil sales. The full story: US naval forces in the Gulf, to police Iraqi sanctions against smuggling would test oil cargo to see if it betrayed the tell-tale properties that would suggest if it was Iraqi in origin. But what "the specialists & other officials didn't realize was that Iraqi smugglers had made a deal with Iranian smugglers." Contraband Iraqi oil thus was smuggled to Iran in exchange for the Iranian variety, which was then exported. Plus, "Saddam's agents were selling oil to Iran at very low prices, & Iran was shipping the same oil in the same ships from their ports, but under the Iranian flag" (to pass unmolested through the Gulf). An interesting book. (06Aug) Cheer

 The fun is about to begin!!!! Our Martha has brought us her always top-notch DVD of holiday fun and "education" this time in the theme of Halloween, which seems to be one of her favorite celebrations!!   These enjoyable and fun idea's are from her former TV show format which have been transferred onto DVD's. They come with her demand for nothing but high quality picture and sound, let alone the idea's and projects that will keep you and the kids entertained and busy for hours, depending on what great fun you want to tackle first!!  The DVD is in 6 different area's of Halloween magic:  PUMPKINS:  1) pumpkin carving 101 ( I really loved the use of "miniature" lights to place inside a pumpkin; it was so pretty!) 2) pumpkin creatures (this was a really clever way of mixing different gourds and pumpkins to make creative creatures) 3) pumpkin owls  COSTUMES:  1) supermarket costumes 2) fleece costumes (such adorable idea's like the little tree) 3) baby chicken (this was such a great idea for little ones plus idea's of the things you can make with garbage bags and coffee filters!) 4) fish head costumes (there is a material called "specialty sparkle film" that's used in emergency workers outfits and it is just brilliant for this idea and can be easily purchased at craft stores) 5) pirate costume  DECOR:  1) clothespin bats 2) spider cone lanterns 3) window silhouettes (these were alot of fun and the kids can pose for the ones you make for big windows or long glass doors) 4) glow stick spiders 5) specimen bottles 6) shrunken heads (this was a blast with the use of Granny Smith apples that are sculpted then "shrunken"!)  TREATS: (these are fun to make if they aren't all eaten first)  1) Halloween cupcakes 2) white chocolate ghosts 3) popcorn balls   TRICK or TREAT:  1) pillowcase treat bags 2) animal treat bags 3) reflective bags (these were a great and kid-safe idea because of the use of reflective tape, plus the kids will have fun making them)  MAKEUP:  1) frightfully scary makeup 2) bruises and scars 3) special effects makeup (this is the filming of how Martha was transformed into the "Spider Lady" that was on the October issue of MSL; it's an amazing episode that gives some insight into the world of special effects)  The price for this DVD is well worth it and all the idea's within can be easily made without needing alot of time and money. So if Halloween is as much fun for you as it is for Martha, then consider this DVD and have a safe and fun day! 
 First of all, I love Gary Chapman's books. I started with reading "The Five Love Languages", then I read "The Love Languages of God".  As a new Christian, there are things that I found very difficult to understand when people who explain to me their opinion of a Christ-centered relationship and what a mature Christian is.  I was so confused and felt disappointed and hopeless.  CHAPMAN'S book came to my rescue!  The chapter "Covenant Marriage" explained the concept of a Christ-centered relationship and actually gives you some pretty basic steps to build that foundation.  The chapter "Spiritual Intimacy" is probably the section of the book that meant the most to me.  It explained the concepts of spiritual growth and spiritual intimacy. --Spiritual Growth illustrated to me that I was a mature Christian, and that mature Christians want to be more like Christ.  It's not that they've been going to church and reading the Bible for years.  It's in their willingness to be living sacrifices to God and to be more like Christ. --Spiritual Intimacy also answered the question that I had, "How can a newly rededicated Christian be loving, convenant relationship with someone who has been a Christian for some time?"  According to Chapman, both partners don't have to be at the same level in their relationships with God; however, they have to be willing to share it with each other.  This book gave me a lot of hope for establishing a devinely blessed covenant relationship with the man God has chosen for me

I don't want to give the ending away, so read the book for more 
 This book is about a boy named Billy.  He chose to take a dare from his friend, Allan.  This dare has to do with Billy eating 15 worms in 15 days and getting $50.00 if he wins.  Billy takes the dare because (1) he wants a minibike that costs $50.00 and (2) he takes any dare.  I do recommend this book because you will be surprised to know what will happen...will he win or lose the bet, or will he get sick trying 
 This book is an excellent introduction to PHP, MySQL, and the interaction of the two. It has a few chapters introducing PHP, then a few introducing MySQL, and then walks through the steps necessary  to build a functioning dynamic website. They also include an elaborate and detailed case study of a Winestore application the author's developed.  Whenever somebody tells me they are interested in PHP and web programming, this is the book I tell them to get. Many friends have borrowed my copy since I got it 
 Three things that make 'Influence' more useful than 95% of marketing books: - It is based upon observation and experiment, not just the author's opinions. - Cialdini uses examples from marketing, advertising, cartoons, and the real world to illustrate his points. - The book is not a new business pitch from an ad agency or a front for a consulting group. Cialdini is not out to sell you anything (other than this book). He just wants to share these fascinating things he's learned.  Each chapter covers one specific 'Weapon of Influence'. It's easy to read in bite-size chunks, and Cialdini's insights are broadly applicable in marketing whatever you've got. 'Influence' is perhaps the most useful book on advertising and marketing I've come across since Luke Sullivan's 'Hey Whipple!' 
 I have referred all of my depresssed cleints to this book.  It is a broad-based approach to contending with depression, and is eminantly usable.  O'Conner takes a commen sense approach to a debilitating process, and in doing so, exhibits uncommon intelligence in offering a wide variety of approaches to dealing with depression, which is notoriously difficult to treat and requires a multi-headed approach for best results.  No one school is best, and clients benefit from a multitude of suggestions founds in this book.  
 This movie is kind of crazy . . . I mean, it's incedibly well done and really makes you think, but man!  It's so intense!  I cried so many times during the movie that I thought it might depress me for the rest of the week.  It didn't though.  It's really, really beautiful . . . Sad, yes . . . but beautiful.  I would have preferred the language to be a little less crude at times, but other than that I'd tell anyone to watch it, at least once.  It really, really makes you think 
 Before mainstream and "good looks" to sell their vocals, there was New Edition. A young group of pre-teens and teens selling songs of good taste and good production.  This is what started the next wave of R&B and paved the way for groups like Boyz 2 Men, 112, and others 
 Katie Holmes stars in "Pieces of April", an interesting film about thanksgiving and family.  Katie Holmes plays April. She's a bit of the black sheep of her family and something of a rebel. She's moved to New York and went out with a drug dealer, but now she's trying to put her life back on track. She's got a caring new boyfriend (Derek Luke), who she lives with in their modest, kind of run down apartment. April's family is to visit them for thanksgiving this year, and she really wants to get things right, especially since it might be her mother's last thanksgiving dinner, as her mother has cancer. Everything should be fine, April thinks, she's got all the cooking figured out in her head, she just has to do it. Doing the cooking, however, becomes a little more difficult when April's oven breaks down. Left with no other choice, April goes from door to door of her building, looking for a place to cook her turkey, even if it's only for a couple of hours. Will April manage to piece together a perfect meal? A resonable meal? Will she manage to make a meal at all?  This film was done with digital video, which I think has its advantages and disadvantages. Being digital, the image is fairly crisp, which means all the cooking scenes are really clear. You can see she's not working in the cleanest kitchen, or on the most delicious turkey, or using the best ingredients. Being video, it looks a little lower budget than your average film, which kind of emphasizes the smallness and delapidation of the apartment. I could have lived without all the shaky camerawork though.  I found this in the comedy section of my DVD store, but it's more like a drama, I think. There are funny moments, but they kind of rise out of the situation, rather than being played for laughs. There are sad moments, moments of tension, a whole range of emotions. Gets a bit grim, and a little depressing at times, but then again, it could have been done a lot worse.  Most of the characters are likeable, and when they're not, you can understand where they're coming from.  I quite liked the soundtrack, which seemed to feature quite a lot of songs by the Magnetic Fields and a band (according the subtitles) called "6ths". Magnetic Fields are on a list of bands I've been meaning to check out, so it was nice to hear some music from them.  Special features include 15 minute behind the scenes piece called "All the Pieces Fit Together", which contains rehearsal footage and interviews with the cast. There's also an audio commentary from the director and the original theatrical trailer.  Not what I expected, but interesting enough. Worth a look 
 I found Easy Spanish Reader to be an indispensable help in my quest to perfect my Spanish.  The gradual sequence of less difficult to more difficult was helpful and the stories are interesting.  The price is also quite good. Hint:  If you wish a truly inexpensive reader/reference guide to the Spanish language, try Language Dynamics Spanish Book for $11.00 on Amazon.  Amazingly simple, this text will give you complete same-page translations of very short and easy to understand stories and dialogs. My text helped me immensely with Easy Spanish Reader because it allowed me to 'build up' to a more sophisticated reading level (once I was reading at a native speakers' second grade level, this became easy). Getting to the native speakers' second grade reading level is NOT easy, and this is where Language Dynamics Spanish Book saved me. By the way, when you are ready to actually 'speak' the language, try 'Behind the Wheel Spanish' 8 CDs and text.  Great course! 
 Donald Davis, in his book Lightning Strike, has made an effort to clarify the historical record by providing details that demonstrate, once and for all, who was responsible for shooting down the bomber that carried Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto over Bougainville in April 1943.  Much of the book focuses on events leading up to the mission to find & shoot down Yamamoto's aircraft.  This first portion of the book introduces the members of the strike team that was responsible for intercepting & destroying the target.  Tom Lanphier, one of the pilots on the mission, claimed that he was solely responsible for shooting down the aircraft carrying Yamamoto, but Davis brings forth the new evidence that was not available to contemporary historians immediately following the war demonstrating that Lanphier not only did not shoot down Yamamoto's plane by himself, but probably had no involvement whatsoever in shooting down the aircraft.  The book is an easy read & certainly does provide new insights into the 60+ year old controversy over who was responsible for ending Yamamoto's involvement in World War II.  I would change only a couple of things about the book - the first is very minor: at the conclusion of the book, Davis tells us that Rex T. Barber was responsible for the destruction of Yamamoto's bomber, but then he ends the book by writing "In 2004...Rex Barber deserved 100 percent credit for shooting down Admiral Yamamoto.  The resolution was accompanied by legislation to clear the path for Congress to finally award Barber the Medal of Honor."  Unfortunately, he does not tell the reader whether or not the deserved medal was ever awarded (as it turns out, the legislation was still pending as of the publication date of the book).  The 2nd thing I would change is a little more significant - I would have changed the length of the book by removing some of the pre-mission background information about the members of the strike team.  The details presented make for interesting reading, but (in my opinion), don't really add to the understanding of the  mission itself.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for an understanding of what happened to Admiral Yamamoto on that fateful day 
 Enjoyable film with great music, lots of laughs, and a message about action in our time 
 	Mrs. Boynton sorrowfully reached her "appointment with death" sooner than usual in Agatha Christie's enthralling book.  The twisting plot and realistic characters keep you on the edge of your seat as you wade deeper into the unpredictable story.  Agatha Christie's magic has once again weaved its way into one of her finest stories, Appointment with Death.  Everyone is on their feet cheering the Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot, as he uses his "little gray cells" in order to determine not who would kill Mrs. Boynton, but who would not kill this old, cruel witch. 	The characters, although not my favorite part of this book, were unlike any I have ever read about before.  Mrs. Boynton a cruel, power-hungry, old woman is hated by everyone in this enriching plot.  She is a failure with a thirst for power that is fed by bossing around her family.  Everyone has a reasonable motive for killing Mrs. Boynton, especially her "devoted" yet unhappy family.  Hercules Poirot is the other main character in this book. He is possibly the most important.  He is a Belgian detective who is extremely proud of two things, his mustache and his "little gray cells."  He sets out to examine the suspicious circumstances and bring the clever murderer into the spotlight. 	Murderers on the run with a brilliant Belgian detective hot on the trail... plots don't get much more exciting than that.  This is the exciting plot expressed in Agatha Christie's Appointment with Death.  The captivity faced by Mrs. Boynton's family, and the prospect of one of the family being the horrible murderer is almost too much to bear.  One of the great things about the plot is that the emotion displayed pulls you into the story.  This plot was so unexpected and complex that I was kept guessing as to the murderer's identity until the very end.  The only way to truly express the feeling put into the plot is to say that Agatha Christie's light shines again. 	The only thing in this book that thoroughly disappointed me was the setting.  It did not take away from the rest of the book, however, it did not add "wow" factor to the story.  I felt like it was a normal everyday setting and that is not what I was looking for in Agatha Christie's book.  The setting helped make the whole story more believable, but most mystery lovers are not looking for a realistic, believable book. Instead they are looking for an exciting thrilling book.  I felt that Agatha Christie did not live up to her name with this setting.   	Appointment with Death was, overall, a thrilling mystery book.  I was thoroughly delighted with Agatha Christie's effort and felt that her feelings showed throughout it.  The plot and characters added a breathtaking "wow" factor that kept me up all night reading this book.  The setting, although not bad, did not contribute anything unique to the book.  Overall, it was a great book for mystery readers of all ages.  Agatha Christie has done it again, creating one of the world's finest mystery stories.

 Raheem has such an exquisitely gentle and sweet voice.  This album it's all about LOVE and the positive aspect of it at that.  I wish there were more artists that would focus on what's positive about life.  I am on cloud 9 and I don't wanna come down from it! Every track is my favorite.  
 Robert Wright's NonZero is quite a well-written book. I went into this treatise expecting to be irritated and expecting to find someone who did not know what they were talking about. I was wrong on both accounts.  Wright does a good job of theorizing on the driving forces of cultural and biological evolution, claiming that both are driven by intrinsic cost-benefit analyses that are basically enforced by that brute of the biological world: survival. If we weigh our analysis improperly, we will not have a chance to regret it. To a certain extent, he is correct. His arguments are lucid and rational, at least for the majority of the book.   However, at one point I must confess that our dear Mr. Wright left the road of rationality, driving headlong into the realm of near-psychotic hatred of Stephen Jay Gould. Now, admittedly, I don't agree with Dr. Gould's theories of evolution either. Particularly his viewpoint on punctuated equilibrium. However, Dr. Gould is a trained biologist, and a world-known expert in the field of evolutionary theory. As near as I can tell from Mr. Wright's mangled ideas of DNA (at one point he claims that it is not only a blueprint for proteins, but that it unconsciously "decides" which proteins to create, which is a technical falsity. As a trained molecular biologist, I can honestly say this is not a common or widely held point of view, mainly because proteins serve these functions), Mr. Wright is an anthropologist. To be clear, he does have a good grasp of the facts of evolution, but he is not the expert that Dr. Gould is. Therefore, when Mr. Wright, on page 393, claims that Dr. Gould's arguments are based on biases and not on reasoned facts seems short-sighted. In fact, he spends nearly 30-40 pages trying to savage the arguments of Dr. Gould, and claims, with what credible basis I am not informed enough to discuss, that Dr. Gould's arguments are false.  This is really the major problem that I had with this book. The other problem was a small point really. While Mr. Wright acknowledges the forces of irrationality in the decisions of heads of state and the possession of peoples of weapons capable of wiping out an entire city or state in one fell swoop, he fails to tie these two critical pieces of information together. He argues that societies making poor, zero-sum evaluations are eventually ground into dust by history, but he fails to adequately acknowledge the fact that they may take a good portion of the world's population with them. He seems to know this, and doesn't seem concerned, which really isn't my problem. My main problem is that he fails to see this as a dent in his rosy imaginations of the future of our species.   Overall, well argued and well thought out. Several glaring fallacies do exist, but they are not enough to destroy enjoyment of the book. Good job. This book should be as widely read as the reviews of it suggest that it is. If you are interested in cultural anthropology, or decision science, then this may be a good pick for you. If not, pass it by for the latest Grisham thriller.   Harkiu 
 This film incredibly touched my heart showing true goodness and depth from a source many would instead link to self-centerness and ditsyness, the most popular girl in school. She uses her popularity for goodness and has real love for others in every situation, although sometimes at expense of her own happiness, but it isn't false as she also her all the range of normal emotions with all the doubts, anger and all but makes the right and good decisions of love and concern for others instead. Even eventually realizing happiness for herself is possible while caring for and helping others. An amazingly well done and realistic a touchingly practical idealist that I can relate to deeply including the struggles of being truly good to others and selfless while not neglecting oneself, nor falling to selfishness. A lovely film of beauty, compassion and shining purity 
 Gay Talese does a brilliant job of narrating the evolution of sexuality during the 20th century.   By thoroughly including all the movers and shakers in the development of censorship legislation, sex shops, massage  parlors, communes and sexual revolutionists in enthralling detail, Talese  manages to create a riveting tale of human sexuality.  By infiltrating the  sexual revolution of the 60's and 70's, Talese offers first-hand accounts.   He artfully balances his keen observations as a slightly removed journalist  with indulgent, self-purposeful experimentation, then masterfully conveys  his findings to his audience.  Like "Honor Thy Father", Talese  invests a great deal of time and risk in researching his material and the  result is a page-turner.  While he tends to mention numerous names of  people who shaped 20th century sexuality, the result is not overwhelming  but instead may inspire you to keep a list of names as you read through the  book with the intention of researching these people yourself.  Indeed, this  masterpiece flows with gripping narrative style, introducing characters  that seemingly have no relationship to one another, until you read further  and find that their influence is intricately commingled.  This book will  fascinate you with its exploration and understanding of American sexual  identity.  A must read 
 Contrary to what some believe the Grape family depicted here is not dysfunctional.  Rather they are a loving one that hold together despite personal tragedy.  Director Lasse Hallstrom relates their story with the correct degree of understatement and virtually no sugar coating.  The film is aided by a superb cast.  Johnny Depp is stupendous as the taciturn title character who is the rock and support mechanism of the Grapes after the absence of the father.  Darlene Cates is a real find as the morbidly obese Momma.  Cates evokes the tragedy of her character with little pathos.  The best performance here comes from Leonardo DiCaprio as the mentally handicapped Arnie.  I cannot recall a performance in any other film where retardation was presented so realistically and it's even more amazing when considering DiCaprio's relative youth at the time.  The American heartland is also beautifully lensed by Ingmar Bergman's longtime cinematographer Sven Nykvist.  In a word, essential viewing 
 I'm not a huge Woody Allen fan.  I don't know why I don't enjoy his films as much as most people do.  This one however is a gem for me.  The satire and social commentary is so dead on.  Allen himself is so gifted in physical comedy.  I wish he made more movies in which he could have showcased his "Chaplin" like qualities.  This one is a winner 
 True - I could not put this book down.  From the very first page, I was pulled into the story and followed this group of "class mothers" anxiously through to the very last page.  Now I want more!  The author weaves an amazing tale of these women and their families through the insidious world of an elite private pre-school in New York.  Ms. Stewart's flawless craftsmanship of this tale gives us a real peak into the world of upper class New York private education.  I loved this book and highly recommend it 
 Martin Wolf, noted Financial Times columnist and professional economist, has written the most readable, empassioned and convincing defence of the new global economic order to date.  Wolf's approach assumes little knowledge on the part of the reader, while at the same time demanding a keen intellect to follow all of his arguments through to their conclusions.  Most effective are his relentlessly convincing counters to virtually all of the objections raised by the rag-tag "anti-globalisation" crowd, as Wolf clearly demonstrates that globalisation increases economic output and wealth everywhere and for everyone, and that without globalisation, poor countries are destined to remain poor.  Wolf's main thrust is that the world needs more globalisation, not less, and he remains critical of Western countries who themselves contribute to "limited" globalisation by continuing protectionist agricultural tariffs and retaliatory tariff and dumping practices.  In all, a complete tour-de-force, and utterly convincing that the path we are on as a world is the right one, and that the arguments of the critics are more sentimental than real 
 I still haven't seen the movie, but I now would see it because of the music. This soundtrack has some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard. I play the violin and to hear this music is so inspiring. John Williams uses the violin in very moving ways. The music also has a jewish flavor, which in my opinion, is very necessary element. In conclusion, it is a masterpiece, buy it!! 
 All you need to know about e-Economy. First, it explains the paradigm of  this type of business, and how organizations need to morph themselves for  it. It gives an excellent view of the necessary packages and categories of  technologies to support the developments in this field. A must-read to  understand the e-Buzzwords and gain a standard vocabulary 
 At first, I did not realize that 'The Green Man' is a book for young adults. The give-away was when I realized that there was no sex or violence!  The book is a fast read and I enjoyed the stories.  Some are better than others as is true in most anthologies and a couple are truly inspired.  The stories are a nice way to connect with the natural world 
 Lindsey Davis' Marcus Didius Falco mysteries offer so many things I enjoy: a convincing street-level view of history, charming characters (and a few who aren't at all charming, but are always fascinating), intriguing mysteries mixed with a tempting ongoing story, and a style that's breezy  and irreverent but not at all cynical (rather like M. Didius himself). And  underneath it all, a respect for the homely virtues that make it all worth  doing, for the writer and her hero. I've been gobbling up the books since  discovering the first one 
 I teach second grade and am reading this to my class. They are really enjoying the story which is told from the point of view of Humphrey the hamster.  The writing is kid friendly and very engaging.  If I miss a day the kids are asking me when I'll read about Humphrey again.  I bought the other book, Friendship According to Humphrey, and plan on reading that to the kids, also. 
 When I was 12 or so, I read some stories of this book which was translated in Korean.  At first, I didn't like the stories very much, because they were very different form those day's my favorites such as 'little  mermaid'or 'other fairy tales about princess and prince of farland.' In  Eleanor's stories, even the kings, princes, and princesses did something  such as dusting, cooking, going market etc. But after that, I found myself  thinking repeatedly about 'the king and the corn', 'westwoods', 'the  seventh princess', 'the kind farmer', and 'the author's note(in Korean  book, it itself was titled "the little bookroom). So I read them  again, really loved them, wanted to read them in English, and got this book  form amazon.com. Every story was fascinating ! The children, fairies,  kings, princesses who were cooking, dusting, and going market, were like my  friend who I had thrown over the fense of 'westwoods'. I was really happy  to meet and love them again, and I am happy now writing this and imagining  someone who read this, read 'westwoods', or 'the kind farmer' , and love  them.   When I was reading the book, I felt I myself was in the 'little  bookroom' and now I want my own little bookroom 
 this book is probably the best book I have read on the intricacies of c++.  It opened my eyes to the many faults I have as a programmer 
 This is a great coffee table book! At a reasonable price. It is loaded  with beautiful photography of many different aspects of Thailand.  If you  love Thailand you will love this book.  If you know nothing of Thailand  this book will make you want to learn more.  When your friends see it they  will be ooing and aawing 
 a rare election of classics of the Hammer Films! if you he is fan of the English producer, cannot be without these classics 
 This book can assist you in developing your relatioship with Infinite Source. The captivating point is the use of special herbs and plants for this purpose. Some spritualist may refer to this process as the dark side, however, the use of spiritual desciplines to tap and nurture your inner self cannot be underrated. 
 the most hauntings shots of film i have ever seen are the opening and closeing shots of this epic masterpiece of the madness power and wealth can cause. the shots of the army draging a huge cannon while in armor and carring suplies(knowing the cast was really doing this as cgi effects are many years away) gives you the feel of the power of nature and a feeling of where these men will end up by the end of the movie.    as an officer under a noblemans command, aguirre(kinski in the role of a lifetime) is slowly seeing that he can become rich and grab a lot of land if he can lose the nobleman leader and strike out on his own. so taking men and supplies with him he sets out to conquer this harsh unforgiven land, and loses his mind in the process. the film is remarkable as it shows us how quickly the land and maddness overtake aguirre and his men,who set out down a river looking for a city of gold! the river trip is the most unforgiven trip i have ever seen, as sickness and unseen natives slowly take their tole on the exploriers. the finale shot of aguirre giving a speach to a dead crew as he flots down the empty river is both heartbreaking and a chilling look at madness at its most unchecked!    the transfer is great ant the movie has never looked better,so give this one a try!!!!!! 
 Harry Bosch and his partner Kiz Rider are working cold cases and they come up with one Harry worked 13 years earlier....a case Harry has not been able to lay to rest.  Connelly is at the top of his game with this one.  The plot moves along at a rapid pace though several twists and turns.  Never a dull moment.  On a personal note, I grew up in Southern California and I'm still a die-hard Dodger fan.  So, the little bit of history about Echo Park, Chavez Ravine and how Dodger stadium came to be was all very interesting to me.  A thoroughly enjoyable read 
 This book opened another dimension to my eyes...this book will lead you to an intellectual adventure 
 I bought "An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy 1917-1963" because of its author's stature as a scrupulously fair and highly literate historian and biographer. Robert Dallek, a Professor of History at Boston University, is well known for his scholarly works, and especially for his two-volume biography of President Lyndon Johnson (entitled "Lone Star Rising" and "Flawed Giant.")  Because of Dallek's sterling reputation for objectivity, I figured that "An Unfinished Life" would be an excellent biography of JFK.  I was not disappointed.  Of the four JFK biographies I've read over the years (now including "An Unfinished Life"), Dallek's book stands head and shoulders above the others in terms of detail, scholarship, and objectivity.    "An Unfinished Life" is an excellent and important new book about President John F. Kennedy.  It may, in fact, be THE essential one-volume biography of JFK for those readers who value objectivity as a key quality in works of history and biography.   It combines in one volume all the most pertinent facts about the life and political career of the 35th President of the United States, presented in a seamless and well-written, (although rather stylistically stuffy) narrative.  True to his reputation for fairness and objectivity, Robert Dallek scrupulously avoids attempting to create new controversies about JFK; at the same time, he doesn't shy away from making negative judgments about Kennedy's decisions and actions when he feels those judgments are warranted.  The whole fabric of Dallek's book is based on sound research and upon well-known and documented facts.  There are, however, two vitally important threads that run through "An Unfinished Life", which are based on new research and previously undocumented facts:  his predilection for philandering, and serious chronic problems with his health.  The first thread, according to Dallek, has its roots in Kennedy's overall view of women.  Even as an adolescent, Jack viewed women as objects to be used for his own gratification, much as his father did.  Dallek presents a powerful case that young Jack was certainly aware of his father's many dalliances.  Such behavior was actually encouraged among the wealthy families of the day, so it seemed perfectly normal.  While he was in college and in the Navy, Jack's letters to friends are filled with references to his sexual exploits.  Even after his marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier in 1953, Kennedy's dalliances continued... almost up to the day he died.  Kennedy's sexual appetite was also linked to the second important thread in "An Unfinished Life": his chronic health problems.  From earliest childhood, Jack was chronically ill with a succession of extremely painful and life-threatening maladies that eluded doctors' attempts to diagnose and treat them.  He was constantly in and out of hospitals with chronic stomach, colon, and prostate ailments, and severe lower back pain.  He was treated with steroids that probably only made his back pain much worse.  As he got older, his physical sufferings increased;  in 1947, he was diagnosed with Addison's disease.  Kennedy's illnesses imbued him with a strong fatalistic streak and an attitude that he might as well enjoy life's pleasures now, for tomorrow he may die.  As it became more apparent that he was on the road to the White House, Kennedy, his father, brother, and political advisors, all made a concerted effort to "cover up" JFK's ailments.  They successfully painted him as a robust picture of youthful good health, beset only occasionally by back pain brought on my an old war injury.  It was, in fact, a myth that lasted until well after Kennedy's death.  Overall, "An Unfinished Life" presents a positive picture of JFK.  Dallek's overall judgment is that Kennedy was a successful President - perhaps even a near-"great" Chief Executive - because he was able to faithfully discharge the duties of his office during an especially difficult period in American history, despite having to contend with chronic health problems that would have defeated a lesser man.  In Dallek's view, President John F. Kennedy was neither a "saint" nor a "sinner," but instead, was the "idealist without illusions" whose Presidency was marked by successes and failures in equal measure.  Read and enjoy!  
 I read this book from the perspective of having a family member with epilepsy.  Not only is this a great "graphic novel," it accurately portrays the experience one has living with a family member that is afflicted. It was astonishing to me that the author's family was so heavily involved with alternative therapies. I can identify since that has been a factor in our family too.  Macrobiotics played a prominent role in both cases initially but without effect.  Reading about their journey left me not knowing whether to laugh or cry since so many of those experiences are familiar.   I knew I was going to identify with this book after reading page 10.  On that page is a picture of many doctors making a big ring around the patient and his parents. It is so typical of the endless search for a treatment that will bring back the person that we knew before the seizures started. One phenomenon this book so accurately captures is a feeling of near helplessness as the seizures come and go in spite of medical therapy. Then with poor control the afflicted individual can slowly slide down a path of mental deterioration.   I was impressed with how many alternative therapies were tried before the family gave up.  Each new alternative therapy was like the hope of a "cure" dangling just out of reach.  They seemed to go through the range of conventional medical therapies offered at the time as well.  Possibly, frustration with conventional medicine, due to unrealistic expectations, leads one to explore the other paths of unconventional treatments.  The artwork is magnificent.  The symbolism is wonderful. To grasp it all would require a reading dedicated to pondering each image, and possibly the reader would need a personal experience with a family member or friend that was afflicted with epilepsy.  I enjoy flipping through the book now to relive the experience I had reading it the first time.  The drawings bring back the emotions.   I highly recommend this book.  For those that would try alternative therapy for epilepsy, to the exclusion of what modern western medicine has to offer, the outcome of the book might make them think twice. 
 The revised edition of Doctor O'Connor's Multiple Sclerosis: Everything You Need To Know offers all the latest details on the disease from a neurologist with over 20 years clinical experience treating those with MS. From a basic description of what MS is to its symptoms, treatment, and the latest research, this revised, updated edition includes drug tables, case histories, charts, and more. 
  I'll be honest. What got me watching this movie in the first place? Well, I was flipping channels and caught a quick glimpse of Jennifer Espinito, Just as if she were standing on the side of the highway hitchiking, and I slammed on the brakes to stop and pick her up, my channel surfing stopped dead right there!!!!  Not expecting a hell of alot from a movie she were starring in, I decided to check a bit of it out, since I was lucky enough to catch it right at the beginning of the movie.  To my pleasant surprise my interest was grabbed and held right from the start. The storyline seemed interesting enough, the acting very good, and it truly just kept getting better, and more interesting, and entertaining.  Robert patrick and Jennifer Espinito had great chemistery throughout the movie. Being a movie you've never heard of, you'd figure, or expect it to end up being a movie that gets to hard to believe. Though this movie seemed as if it were going to go that way, they could not have wrapped it up better.  as the credits begin rolling, you'll find yourself sitting there, eyebrows raised, and saying out loud "That was a really great movie!"  IT WAS! AND IT IS WELL WORTH CHECKING OUT!!! 
 This Serise just keeps getting better and better.  The Emerson's are at it agian and they are taking the rest of us along for the ride.  God bless you Elizabeth Peters for continuing to put out quality material.  
 This is my second Dumas novel, the first being "The Count of Monte Cristo".  This is another excellent tale.  Dumas weaves countless details into his plot.  One wonders what significance they have at the time.  Near the end of the book, you muse aloud to yourself, "Ah!  That's why"!  Spellbinding, another must read 
 This is Me'Shell's best recording, and in fact a quintissential new funk/R&B recording that deserves a place in anyone's collection.  It represents an exploration, both sonically and conceptually.  The songs that start out as ballads end up as tight, intense grooves, and the songs that start out fast still sound smooth and deep.    I was attracted to this recording because I am a bass player, and Me'Shell is as funky a bass player as they come.  What brings me back to this recording, again and again, is the quality of the songwriting and the boldness of the musical statements she makes.  Buy it 
 Most of the reviews of this film appear to have been written by males, so I thought I would add a female point of view to the discussion.  I bought the DVD for my husband for Valentine's Day, he being a fan of the western genre, and watched it with him. It's not exactly romantic Valentine's Day fare.  Here are a few short observations:  In my opinion, the film should be rated "R," instead of "PG," because of its violent scenes.  There are no good guys in this film, only flawed characters. I found the Marlon Brando character, the amoral regulator, blood-chillingly evil. Compared to him, the bumbling rustlers seem almost to be sympathetic characters. I very nearly found myself rooting for the "bad" guys.  This is not your typical, old-fashioned western. It's a more-interesting film with more-believable characters.   
 Alex Delaware rocks as an infallible and lovable main character, a psychologist who has relationship problems like anyone else! In this novel of the series, someone sends a "murder book," or a book showing the most gruesome crime scene photos with a commentary of what happened to the case. Alex and his cop buddy, Milo Sturgis, soon begin untangling a web of lies, deceit and disgust as Milo recognizes one victim as a case he cut his teeth on as a young rookie, years past. It always bothered him that the case, a brutal rape and murder, was never solved. Together, the two set out to do just that -- and solve a slew of other crimes in one fell swoop.  As always, Kellerman shines in his characterization. I have a hard time reminding myself that these characters exist only in Kellerman's mind -- and the minds of readers. They seem so real as to jump off the pages!  The Murder Book was action after action and made me not want to put it down for a second. However, the vast amount of characters made it difficult to keep track of, and caused me to keep turning back and rereading.   This is a stellar read for those who love gritty crime and thrillers. It's a mad chase for justice in a situation where no one really wins. Kellerman's heroes plunge into the investigation and tune into the politics only to look for a sick, twisted pervert.   I highly recommend this as one of Jonathan Kellerman's better books. A cut above the rest 
 There are those that insist that "Mad Dogs & Englishmen," the 1970 record of the Joe Cocker tour, is the high point in the music career of the gravely voiced soul singer. I can see the reasons for the argument, but even with his once powerful voice worn away by alcohol abuse there is something to be said for his sense of phrasing in the later years. He still came up with a great howl on "When the Night Comes" and if I am only allowed to listen to one Joe Cocker track for the rest of eternity I am going to take the monster 9:27 long live version of "With a Little Help From My Friends" that is on "The Best of Joe Cocker." That being said, if you are talking about an entire album, then "Mad Dogs & Englishmen" is the one to go with, because Cocker live was always better than Cocker in the studio, not that this pronouncement is exactly news to anyone.   It helps to set the scene for the 1970 tour. Two years earlier Cocker had hit the top of the charts in the U.K. with his cover of the Beatles' "A Little Help From My Friends," and when he sang the song at Woodstock he made a name for himself in the colonies. Leon Russell became Cocker's musical director and provided a second hit in England with "Delta Lady." Two albums came out in 1969, "With a Little Help From My Friends" and "Joe Cocker!", both of which went gold. What makes this live album so amazing is that Cocker only sings one song form his first album (and it is not even the title cut but "Feelin' Alright") and only three cuts from the second: "Bird on a Wire," "Delta Lady" and another in a series of classic Beatles coves, "She Came in Through the Bathroom Window." So out of 16 songs on the album, a dozen of them are "new" material for Cocker.   Of course such things are a lot easier when you are a cover artist rather than a singer-songwriter. This frees Cocker to come up with songs by the Rolling Stones ("Honky Tonk Woman") and Bob Dylan ("Girl From the North Country"). But whatever the songs a lot of the credit for Cocker's career and this album have to go to Leon Russell and Chris Stainton for coming up with the greatest live arrangements on the Sixties (Give me George Martin in the studio and Leon Russell). The concert was recorded at New York's Filmore East in the spring of 1970 (as a film as well as an album). There were almost two dozen musicians involved, giving a whole new meaning to Noel Coward's famous song title, and the result is the definitive mixture of rock 'n' roll soul with a big brassy sound and Russell's awesome piano playing behind Cocker's powerful vocals.   Part of the impressive result was a couple of Cocker standards in "Cry Me a River" and "The Letter." It was the cover of the later, originally by the Box Tops, that broke Cocker into the U.S. Top 10 for the first time. Other standout tracks include the slower "Superstar" and "I've Been Loving You Too Long, " along with "Give Peace a Chance." Of course, "Mad Dogs & Englishmen" went gold as well as if there are those who want to argue that Joe Cocker's first three albums were his best, it is hard to argue with them. My preference for this one as the best of the lot is based almost on much as it being a double-album as it being live, but the live part is still the key consideration 
 If you like the movies you will love these stories.  Combines page turning reading with  a poetic quality that only Jack London can develop 
 this is an absolutely incredible movie from melville. its so hard to say which is my favorite but this is certainly a contender. the atmosphere plot are masterful. watch i 
 I can't say enough in praise of "All the Words on Stage".  Until I found this dictionary on Amazon - thank you Amazon! - I had been struggling with not only the pronunciations of words but how to figure out where to stress a word.  This extraordinary book does have ALL the words in it and it also explains in a straight forward way why words are stressed as they are.  I like the lay out of each page.  It's clean and easy to read.  Also the way the words are respelled is crystal clear - much easier to follow than other Shakespeare pronouncing dictionaries that I have looked at.  Some of my fellow actors are familiar with the phonetic symbols so it is good that the book includes both the respellings and the phonetics.  The research that must have gone in to this book!   As I was thumbing through it, I was staggered by the specific information that is covered on each word.  The authors must have read, scanned and studied each play many, many times to have been able to compile all of this information.  Another reviewer mentioned wanting to know Elizabethan pronunciations.  I don't know what Elizabethan pronunciations have to do with modern speakers of Shakespeare.  It seems that it is only something that a scholar might find interesting.  As an actor, I need help on how I should be pronouncing these words today and this book has answered all my questions. 
 The mighty lemon drops are good. Ok, now that we've got that out of the way, let me tell you about our trip to Six Flags over Orange Mound. Kroll, Burns, J abs, Terry Tate office linebacker, Former loverboy frontman Mike Reno, Ted Dibiase, Darren Sproles and Me were bored one saturday and decided to head to Libertyland for a little amusement park fun. So we head out and sure enough, six buses of hot women started following us. We get to Six flags and the whole thing started off poorly because they wouldn't let Sproles ride the rides because he was too short. Then all of these black women came up to him saying they loved him on Webster. He got mad and went home because he was kind of a weeny. So after teenyman left, we decided it was time to ride the zippin pippin. The Zippin pippen, named after former chicago bull Scottie Pippen is the scariest roller coaster in the world. What makes it scary isn't the speed since it only goes 3mph, but it goes through Orange Mound and yells racial slurs. We had Ted Dibiase with us so we weren't all that scared. At the end of the day we all ended up with hot women except for Reno because he's fat now. I would go into detail about how much better we are than you at this point, but I'm trying to keep your spirits up 
 This record is simply amazing. Very minimal and laidback at times, but  glistens with a quiet, powerful intensity. "Covergirl" will  definitely find a well-deserved spot in many music lover's collections. Do  not miss out on this wonderful piece of art 
 I am a physician assistant in Cardiology and I have put into practice much of what this book teaches. Alot of it is what I've known for a long time but have not had alot of the research to back up my theories. I recommend it to every patient who has the slightest interest in taking control of their own health 
 The New Yorker and The Times of London both called Only Revolutions "gobbledygook" warning their stodgy readerships not to touch Mark Z. Danielewski's experimental new novel. Only Revolutions is Danielewski's feverishly anticipated second novel.  The author, an internet icon, encouraged the frenzy by asking bloggers for historical tidbits and car and plant names for inclusion in the project he ambiguously masked as "That".  "That" turned into Only Revolutions, and followed up Danielewski's cult bestseller, House of Leaves, in which typographical gimmicks like multiple typefaces, vertical and diagonal text, and a two-color format add visual to verbal stimulation.  Only Revolutions is the next step.  Now in a four-color format with 180 words per page printed right side up, and 180 printed upside down, two colored ribbon placeholders and publisher's advice to read eight pages at a time from each side of the book, Danielewski engages nearly all the physical possibilities of his book.  The book itself--a finalist for the 2006 National Book Award--is beautiful, uniquely capable of provoking love at first sight.  Each side of the book appears to be the front cover, and indeed the novel starts from both ends.  Two 360-page narratives (a full revolution) end where the other begins.  The page numbers rotate flip-book style, and the colored ribbons close in as the page numbers approach 180 and diverge thereafter.  The plot, however, takes a back seat to the book's aesthetics.  The loose and at times elusive plot revolves around two eternally sixteen-year-old protagonists, Hailey and Sam, who narrate from opposite sides, starting their stories 100 years apart.  Despite their historical disparity, the two meet, fall in love, and travel across the country in an orgiastic road trip replete with period cars and teenage conundrums. Historical marginalia lines each page, ambiguously pointing to events the story may or may not concern itself with.  Nothing much happens.  Hailey and Sam have lots of sex.  Usually with each other, sometimes with a group.  They find jobs, quit them, and struggle with the law of the land. They narrowly elude their constant pursuers "The Creep" and "Them". Most pages fill up with the characters' interior monologues, meditations on love and liberty and life. These passages can be difficult and mystifying, and always reward a second, closer reading.  Danielewski spells certain words consistently wrong, he ignores rules of punctuation and grammar, and he writes a dissected prose that's almost blank verse. It's hard to read. Images and rhythms flit across the page faster than the reader's mind can catch hold, straining the plot's already thin thread. It takes a few chapters to catch up with the narrators' runaway pace.  But ultimately, Danielewski saves Only Revolutions from Finnegan's Wake-like abstruseness with the enchanting vitality of his words. Within the bounds of the book's tight structure and the author's self-imposed rules (the drop caps of each 1,440-word chapter spell out H-A-I-L-E-Y A-N-D S-A-M A-N-D H-A-I-L-E-Y...for instance), Danielewski injects dizzying energy line by line.  His palpable, rhythmic language whisks Only Revolutions far from the realm of the ordinary novel into something more personal, something between a literary experiment and a vibrant new epic 
 How do you take a book as psychologically nuanced and sublte as Whitley Streiber's 'Communion' and translate it into a successful film? Judging by the reception it received in theaters across America upon its '89 release and again by the numerous negative reviews here on Amazon.com the answer appears to be you don't.  I guess I'll have to disagree with the majority consensus. In my opinion director Philipe Mora has done an admirable job in visualizing Mr. Streiber's disquieting, otherwordly visions, providing us with a disturbing glimpse into the world of UFO's and their occupants.  Much of the disappointment and animosity expressed towards this film is due to the ambigious nature of the UFO phenomenon and the directors insistence on leaving it that way. To try and pin down or label psychic experiences is to lose forever the essence of these primal encounters. In such matters we can only ask the questions fully knowing we will never receive the final, definitive answer. Are they from outer space, or someplace much closer to home? It is left for the viewer to decide 
 If you think you know what this book is all about - think again!  This book definitely surprised me!  Yes, this is a story of three woman (Anne, a writer; Jennifer, a starlet and Neely, a musician), and how they fight and claw their ways to get their dreams in the mist of drugs, sex and betrayal.  However, the characters don't turn out the way you think they will, and the ending is absolutely perfect.  But this book is not just about these entertainers dirty laundry - there are rare and unparallel bits of humor.  The scene with Neely and the flushing the wig has to be one of my favorite parts in any book.  Just that one scene is worth the entire book!  So leave all your preconceptions at the door, and pick this book up with a fresh mind 
 Maybe it's a bit of a cult movie, but I never get sick of it!  I love the music, the characters, the lines, it will be one to watch with my grandkids 
 This film has a lot of info concerning the life of Basquiat I found that the film gave me a visual of who he was and the people who surrounded him.It made it so much clearer 
 One of the pleasures of a small book is the ability to savour the author's writing.  This volume combines Huxley's essay (which makes the startling claim that Piero's Resurrection is the best painting in the world) with Pope-Hennessy's lucid descriptions of Piero's works.  The plates are wonderful and well arranged.   PH's swipes at Kenneth Clark and John Mortimer would seem churlish in a larger, more ponderous volume, but are merely charmingly opinionated here.  A lovely way to spend an hour or two 
 I found this book for my little girl, after discovering a Dinosaur and Shark book for my son. It is so beautiful I sat in awe for about 30 minutes looking at it when I first received it. It's not Disney's Cinderella, so don't look for any comparisons. Instead, it is a beautiful story full of imaginative pop-ups that allow little girls to pretend they are in the story as Cinderella herself. My little girl (2 years) just loves to sit with me and my husband and flip through the story. Even my 3 year old boy loves to look at it 
 yay for this one. its all like good and stuff... and i am glad there are some women out there that express their feelings toward pushy sex driven men. i like it lots. and you should too. she does a good job of screaming. shes got a pretty scream. anyway. buy it. listen to it. like it. then love it 
 At my petshop I found this book It's my Bible and because I'm a devout follower do I get along so well with my rabbit. My only problem is the "Breeds" section. More text than pictures. This is a must for novice rabbit owners 
 With the CD-Rom and the free online subscription, this resource is invaluable for anyone who needs a hands on resource for words, their origins, etc. 
 INTRODUCTION - Assumptions: 1) mind = spirit, mental growth = spiritual growth, 2) process of spiritual growth is a complex, arduous and lifelong task PART  I - DISCIPLINE = Basic set of tools to solve life's problems = means to spiritual evolution. 	Comments - life is difficult, life is a set of problems. Confronting and solving these problems can be painful (often it involves suffering), but doing so gives life its meaning and leads to growth. Avoidance of problems is the primary basis of mental illness. Discipline is a system of techniques; there are no shortcuts to sainthood. Discipline involves four techniques for experiencing pain (suffering) constructively: 	1) - Delaying Gratification - schedule pain and pleasure so that we get pain over with first. The quality of parenting is determinative in children developing this discipline. Irrational or global punishment is undisciplined discipline and worthless. Good discipline requires good role modeling, love, time and genuine caring. Children need self-disciplined role models, a sense of self-worth and a trust in the safety of their existence. 	2) - Acceptance of Responsibility - we must accept responsibility for a problem before we can solve it. Neurotics accept too much responsibility and are plagued with I "ought to"; those with character disorders don't accept enough responsibility and feel I "had to". Escape from the freedom and responsibility of choosing is common to mental illness; adopting a "victim" mentality is far easier. 	3) - Dedication to Truth - truth is the reality map we use to negotiate life's journey, but maps need constant revision. People will cling inappropriately to old maps (transference), but truth must be more vital to our self-interest than our comfort. This requires openness to challenge and seeking psychiatric help is a legitimate shortcut to openness. Lying (either black = whole woof, or white = partial on purpose) is used to avoid the truth. Three considerations help use truth compassionately: a) Never speak a falsehood, b) Withhold truth only in light of moral consequences but never for purely personal needs, just on the basis of the other person's needs (and this requires genuine love for the other), c) The primary factor in deciding to withhold the truth is the person's ability to utilize the truth for spiritual growth; the capacity for doing this is usually underestimated. 	4) - Balance - flexibility and judgment are required in discipline. Judgment must regulate emotion perhaps to express rather than, as usual, suppress. Essence of the discipline of balancing is "giving up" --- sometimes giving up life styles or behaviors (e.g., necessity to win).  Depression is often from the feeling of giving up something loved. Bracketing is balancing the need for assertion of the self with a need for putting one's self aside. Our lifetimes are series of simultaneous deaths and births. Life can be free from emotional pain because spiritual evolution yields extraordinary joy and love. PART II - LOVE = The motive and energy for discipline = the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth. This definition emphasizes that love depends on a conscious or unconscious purpose, includes self-love with love for others, requires effort, requires will (which is desire resulting in action), and involves an active choice. 	What Love Is Not - 1) - Falling in love is a temporary erotic experience involving a collapse of our ego boundaries (this is neither an act of will, nor an extension of one's self and has little to do with nurturing). It can be a trap to marriage. 	2) - Romantic love (a myth, like falling in love) can stultify growth rather than extend ego boundaries (mysticism is the belief that reality is oneness, but we must find ourselves before we can lose ourselves in oneness or in a beloved). 	3) - Dependency (= inability to experience wholeness without being cared about) is a passive, not active relationship (addictive personalities are dependent on externals and unconcerned with spiritual growth). 	4) - Cathexis (= emotional attachment to a person or thing, e.g., love of money or golf or a pet). Only humans can grow spiritually through love; love is not merely giving but judicious giving and withholding. 	5) - Self-sacrifice that is given to meet one's own needs without regard to the spiritual needs of the receiver. 	6) - A feeling; the feeling of love is the emotion of cathecting, not of loving. Genuine love implies a commitment and an exercise of wisdom. 	What Love Is: 1) - A work of attention; listening, total concentration and empathy (non-love is laziness or alternative focus) 	2) - A risk of loss to evolve from mere cathexis, requiring the courage to change.  	3) - A risk of independence in which one must accept opportunities for one's own destiny, i.e., to grow up. 	4) - A risk of commitment to a relationship of constancy, self-confrontation and extension. 	5) - A risk of confrontation; exercising power with humility; self-scrutiny must precede criticism for we must realize we are playing God. 	6) - A disciplined relationship; one's feelings are a source of energy, but an energy that needs to be mastered by constant judgment and continuing adjustment. 	7) - Separateness wherein a distinction between oneself and the beloved is maintained. If the focus is on oneself, then narcissism results; marriage is likened to a base camp for individuals to make their unique mountain ascents. 	8) - A relationship that can benefit from the mutual guidance of psychotherapy. 	9) - A product of grace. Grace is the source of love. ______________________________________________________________________________ {The following are notes on love from an article by Tim Foard which reinforces many of the ideas presented by Peck. Unfortunately, I didn't record where the article was published, nor have I been able to find any information about Mr. Foard (not even on Google!)]:  Many mistake the feelings of, say, kindness, affection, attraction or tenderness for love, but no feeling ever constitutes love. Love is not an emotion, but a will like, say, sincerity, patience, justice or mercy. Every type of legitimate love is rooted in disinterested love; love is good-willing. It is a commitment to benevolence regardless of self-benefit or feelings involved. Love based only on feelings is always self-motivated and is only as consistent as the desire that creates it. So, many supposedly "in love" display jealousy, usury, dishonesty, impatience and fickleness - stronger emotions! When trouble arises true love shows willingness to adjust (make sacrifices, swallow pride, etc.). Disinterested love establishes lasting friendships (that grow in candor and trust). Love doesn't depend on the return one gets. Love provides the basis for a beneficial, reasonable, self-love, a willing of one's own and other's good in balanced proportion.} _______________________________________________________________________________  PART  III - GROWTH AND RELIGION - Religion = our understanding of what life is all about; (thus, everyone has a religion!) 	World Views and Religion- There is an extraordinary variability in the depth and sophistication of religion in the sense defined above; this understanding of religion doesn't require belief in God, insistence on some necessary practices or membership in a given organization.  	Everyone has some implicit or explicit set of ideas about the world; e.g., that it is chaotic and meaningless, ruthless and cruel or nurturing and benevolent, owes them a living, is full of rigid laws that must be followed, etc.  	Our world view (a.k.a. religion) is incompletely conscious and one's real religion may not be what one claims it is.  	Our world views develop in our formative years by what we sense around us (often from others behavior more than what they tell us). 	Since world views are individualistic and fragmentary, conflicts often result; in this sense all wars are holy wars. 	The Religion of Science - Spiritual growth is a journey from a microcosm into an ever enlarging macrocosm. The path to holiness lies through questioning everything! Some find this happens in college where the religion of their parents is replaced by the religion of science. 	Tenets of the Scientific World View (Religion): 	1) - The world is real and a valid object to examine. 	2) - Examining the universe is of value for human beings. 	3) - The universe makes sense.  	4) - The scientific method is a necessary discipline since humans tend to see what they want to and, thus, are susceptible of being biased, superstitious and prejudiced. 	5) - Experience requires verification (preferably by controlled repetition).  Thus, science can be seen to be a religion of skepticism. Science is an improvement over unquestioning faith, but science has difficulty with the reality of God. Science looks at the history of the belief in God and sees dogmatism, wars, inquisitions, persecutions, etc., with those professing brotherhood killing others in the name of faith. In this respect, religion has a pretty poor track record. 	Is Belief in God a Sickness? Freud viewed religion as a neurosis. Clinical data suggest that a therapist may enter a therapeutic alliance to work through church-inspired guilt and sin. Peck cites three cases from his experience with patients to answer the question "Is God a psychopathology?" He concludes that the answer is complex, both yes and no; mostly dogmatism, not religion, is at fault. Perhaps a skeptical agnosticism is needed to go on to spiritual maturity. But carried to an extreme, this results in tunnel vision where evidence for God is neglected by those who forget that scientists now realize that paradox is real and some phenomena lie outside the applicability of the scientific method. PART IV - GRACE = a force that operates routinely in most people to protect and foster their mental health (a phenomenon unexplainable within the framework of modern science). 	The Miracle of the Unconscious - perhaps up to 95% of mental activity is unconscious and we become aware of this activity only through: 	1) - Dreams - are routinely helpful in various forms - guides to problem solving, warnings of personal pitfalls, indications that something is wrong when we think it is right or that something is right when we think it is wrong. 	2) - Idle thoughts - musings that unexpectedly come up with ideas that we may have struggled to reach.  	3) - Freudian slips - unintended behaviors that reveal how we really view apparent situations. 	Our conscious self-concept almost always diverges from the reality of who we are; our unconscious is wiser and more fully aware than we are. Jung's experiences led him to talk of the wisdom of the unconscious and to suspect that we are all in contact with a universal unconscious, a collective store of wisdom. 	Serendipity = a paranormal phenomenon in which highly implausible events occur with no natural cause and with implausible frequency. These events often produce benefits, perhaps, in proportion to the extent to which they are recognized and appreciated. 	Grace = a powerful force originating outside of human consciousness which nurtures the spiritual growth of human beings. Spiritual growth is the miraculous evolution of an individual which counters entropy in that it increases organization. It requires effort, involves all of humanity and is powered by the force of love.   	The Alpha and the Omega - Where does this love come from? No one has come up with a better hypothesis than there is a God who loves us and wants us to grow; God wants us to become God. Spiritual life begins and ends with God. The fact that we are being nurtured to reach godhead brings us face to face with our own worst enemy, our own laziness. 	Entropy and Original Sin - Non-love is the unwillingness to extend one's self; laziness is love's opposite. In the Garden of Eden (metaphor), Adam and Eve failed to obey, but more significantly, they failed to seek from God why they should obey; they avoided the time, energy, suffering, struggle and possibility of rejection that their questioning might require. The original sin was taking the easy way out.  A major form that laziness takes is fear - often the fear of change. The fight against entropy never ends; our healthy self (which we all have) must always be vigilant against our sick self (which we all also have). 	The Problem of Evil - psychology has, up to now, acted mainly as if evil didn't exist. Peck's clinical experience has led him to conclude: 1) - Evil is real - there are people and institutions who respond to goodness with hatred and seek to destroy the good often in the name of some misidentified greater good. 2) - Evil is laziness carried to its extreme; evil people actively avoid extending themselves. Ordinary laziness is non-love; evil is anti-love. 3) - The existence of evil is unavoidable at this stage of human evolution; the force of entropy and the possession of free will make inevitable the existence of those who work against love. 4) - In entropy's most extreme form (human evil), it is strangely effective as a positive social force in that the outrage against it saves many from its excesses. 	The Evolution of Consciousness - spiritual growth is the coming to consciousness of the knowledge that the unconscious possesses - the knowledge which we need is there because God's wisdom is within us, and within the collective unconscious. Our goal is to become God while preserving consciousness.  	The Nature of Power - there are two kinds of power: 1) - political = the power to coerce others. 2) - spiritual = the capacity to make decisions with maximum awareness. The latter power is a factor in the calm ecstasy of being able to feel "not my will but thine". 	The Welcoming of Grace - redefine serendipity not as a gift, but as a learned capacity to recognize and utilize the gifts of grace which come from beyond the realm of conscious will. We live our lives in the eye of God, in God's loving concern. The reality of grace indicates that humanity spiritually, if not physically, has a rightful place at the center of the universe. 
 Champions of the Force concludes Kevin J. Anderson's Jedi Academy Trilogy which began with Jedi Search and built up to the cliffhanger ending at the end of Dark Apprentice before delivering the payoff in this novel.  Luke Skywalker lies comatose in the Jedi Academy hanging between life and death, the result of a battle with the spirit of Exar Kun, the Dark Lord whose spirit has corrupted Kyp Duron, Luke's most powerful student, and led him on the path to the Dark Side of the Force.  Luke reaches out to Jacen and Jaina Solo, his nephew and niece for their help.  Meanwhile, Luke's sister, Leia Organa-Solo, has a fight of her own, as she races to the planet Anoth to rescue her youngest son Anakin Solo before Imperial forces can destroy the young Jedi child.  Kyp Duron is using the Sun Crusher to destroy star systems loyal to the Empire, which he believes to be a noble cause, but this is a heinous act which will continue to have impact decades after the end of this story.  Admiral Daala is still seeking to strike at the New Republic, using her Death Star prototype.  Other Star Wars favorites are included here--Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, C-3PO and R2-D2.  Champions of the Force is a superb finale to Kevin Anderson's excellent trilogy, and I recommend these books for all Star Wars enthusiasts. 
 For the climber, uninitiated or not, Long has given a very practical instruction on building and analyzing anchors.  The first section of the books explains anchors and equipment used to build them.  For a moment I thought I would be relying on translating the text to a picture in my head--requiring multiple reads.  But the second section (pictures and detailed analyses of anchors) brought the entire book and its concepts together as well as any writer could.  It was clear that Long put a lot of thought and labor into preparing the analysis section for the reader.  This is the most you can get out of an instruction book without actually hiring an instructor.  Additionally, Long's prose is very entertaining and witty in a realm where the material could be incredibly dry, keeping the pages turning.  Reason for 4/5 instead of 5/5: there are some concepts, such as the belayer's place in the anchor, that could have been included in this book without consulting another text.  However, more than your money's worth from this book--a must for the trad and aid climber 
 A very fascinating and practical guide to the real authentic chinese cooking. Very well researched and easy to follow. Being an overseas chinese, I only use to hear about these authentic dishes from my  grandfather, today I am keeping the tradition alive by cooking them! Two  Thumbs up 
 This book astrologically chronicles the journey of the soul in a way that encompasses the attributes and challenges of us all regardless of what sign we happen to be. The book shows that we are influenced by a some or all of the signs and further validates the interconnectedness of the universe. The  book is a major star on my bookshelf 
 The engaging pictures, suprise ending and repeated phrases in this book are the perfect way to get young children excited about subtraction!  As a family of five monkeys goes on a picnic, they begin teasing an alligator.   One by one, the monkeys disappear as the crocodile snaps its teeth.   Children can count the monkeys that are left, after each time the alligator  snaps and join in on the "Can't catch me" line that is repeated.   It seems to be a predictable book, slowly loosing one monkey each time the  alligator comes.  However, the ending is suprising, and some children are  able to find clues in the pictures that lead to finding out the suprise  ending.  This book is a great way for parents or teachers to introduce  subtraction in a meaningful way!  I highly recommend it. : 
 Exciting and spell-binding. My favorite Grisham novel. I was sorry when it ended 
 This is a great little taste of what these women were like. It is easy to read and contains just enough info. I checked it out for myself while at the library with my kids. I loved it 
 Although Elisabeth Withers has appeared with lots of well known people this solo album is a rare talent to behold. A good blend of slow relaxing music & mid tempo R n B, she surely will go on to greater things from her 
 I have listened to Guy Clark since his first appearance on Austin City Limits nearly 25 years ago.  Pure, honest, and an unparalleled story teller.  Real life!  If you don't own this album, you are not a music  lover 
 This was a really fascinating book.  It started off slowly (the first pages were tedious) and the writing is disjointed.  The author jumps from time period to time period and network to network almost convulsively.  You'll be reading about NBC in 2004 and then next thing you know it's ABC in 2000 and then back to CBS in 2005.  That said, the story is compelling: networks passing on shows like Desperate Housewives, Simon Cowell doing American Idol in the hope of discovering talent for his record company.  Careers depend on the ability to predict what the public will watch, and what they will and won't watch isn't as obvious as one might think, even to people in the business with years of experience.  If you have any interest in television, personal politics, or the fallibilities of corporate execs, this is an interesting read 
 This isn't a typical O'Reilly book, and it's definitely not an "animal" book. I think that's something that's thrown a lot of people for a loop the first time they see this book. That change is good, however, because what O'Reilly has delivered is a book whose contents will stand up much longer and be more useful than most of the books out there on any technical subject, from any publisher. By having various viewpoints in information rich, managable pieces so well organized, the book itself is usable both as a read through from cover to cover and as a reference.   Security and Usability (S&U) is targeted at two main camps. The usability camp who doesn't quite understand what a security system is. They think in terms of making the user's experience with the software better, and often that means making the design more accomodating. That's great, and very valuable, but sometimes that's been known to compromise the system's security.  The other camp this book targets is a security application or a security system designer. Often this camp doesn't have a great grasp on usability. We (I think I fall into this category) tend to be power users and build systems that work for power users. When regular users (read: "everyone else") encounter such a system they're usually stuck, and understandably so. S&U introduces many usability concepts and paradigms to the software or system designer and provide a springboard for better results.  Make no mistake, this book wont make you an expert in either field, but it will give you a deeper understanding and a strong foothold at improving both scenarios. If nothing else, it gives both camps the vocabulary to start talking and working together.   One of my favorite chapters in the book outlines how ZoneAlarm was designed and implemented, along with some of its issues along the way. This is a remarkably successful application that achieves both good security design and utility while being usable by a large portion of the population. Such a study - and the book has many similar studies to back up viewpoints - is an invaluable aid in getting the message across.   If you write security software, design security systems, or work with a team that does, by all means look at this book. It will improve your product. 
 There are several great cuts on this album, and some incredible playing throughout. In particular, Worried Life Blues sports one of the most overwhelmingly awesome blues solos you'll ever hear.  That one cut is worth the price of admission 
 When Marcus Didius Falco finds himself rescuing the beautiful niece of a Roman Senator he lets himself in for a world of hurt and a very dangerous assignment. But the plot takes a back seat to the character development. By the end of this book, one has become charmed by and devoted to Falco and his friends 
 This is a great book.  The girls of my girlfriend love the book.  As soon as I sit down, they grab a book and jump in my lap.  
 Allen Toussaint is well on his way to becoming a New Orleans icon, but this great record is certainly not as known as it should be. Toussaint's legendary status as sideman and producer is well documented, but he is also  a fine performer. This record contains all the trademarks;  stone funky  vamps, gorgeous ballads, snappy horn arrangements, superb piano playing and  soulful, gentle vocals. Mr. Toussaint is not touring very much, which is  New Orleans' gain and our loss...in a just world he would be a mega  megastar. "Connected" makes a strong case, and is recommended  listening to anybody who wants to know just how good Nawlins pop music can  get 
 This Collection of Madonna's Ballads is much better than you think it is. (well if you never heard the songs on it). I couldnt have imagined it would turn out to be so great, infact A Masterpiece!  It Really proved to me that Madonna is not just a pop star.  This album contains her best ballads from 1985 to 1995. Songs like Crazy For You and Live To Tell are very Popular, But other songs like the Powerful You'll See and the Acoustic One More Chance are album versions and they are nothing but Classics!. I'll remember and the #1 This Used to Be My Playground were songs for Movies and are only Featured on this album for Madonna. They are Fantastic too!. Take A Bow is the albums best track in my point of view. This is RECOMMENDED for everyone who like Ballads, You will like it even if you hate Madonna!!!    
 Just about all the Lew Archer/Mcdonald mysteries have a very nice South Cal feel, circa 1950-1970, interesting characters, often university types, and tormented families with skeletons hidden in the closet. Lost relationships, long past deaths, and folks who do not seem to have a murderous streak, are featured in about all the Archer books. So for a smooth and interesting ride through these parts, one can do a lot worse than reading R. Macdonald. Why only 4 stars? Because there is a formulaic tendency where the books seem very similar, and somewhat dated. And the characters and circumstances are not really fleshed out like many current mystery masters. Even so, you can never really be disappointed with an Archer, just as you always know, and cannot really be disappointed, say, in a Starbucks CoffeeShop experience, and I mean this in the best sense! 
 I purchased the box set after watching on TV and got completely hooked. I live in the UK and couldn't wait for it to relese here and would recommend for anyone who likes a great plot, with twists and turns to make you giddy. The creators of this smash hit show are pure genius. The story line is never dull and draws you in deeper with each episode, you really do get into the minds and lives of all the characters & picking your favorites as you go. I have never been so captivated by a TV series since the X-Files, and would be hard pushed to chose a favorite between the two.. a MUST buy **** 
 This movie shows the real life hell that was Andersonville.  A prison camp that turned into a death camp. Not enough food,water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there. The south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers. Basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them. A well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa

 The paperback and hardback editions of Taylor's Poems are NOT the same.  The paperback has only about half of the poems.  It does not even contain the complete Prepratory Meditations.  Unless you want a "Selected Poems" approach, buy the hardback 
 This entire series should carry a warning label--"Could Cause Serious Dependence."  Impossible to put one down without reaching for the next 
 I have a 41 year old son that loves the stories of Charlie Brown.  He recently mentioned that he had the original Charlie Brown book we gave him as a small boy.  I saw the collection on the website and thought it would make a great Christmas present for him this year.  I can only say that he will love them and when I told his 13 year old son what I had done he said his dad would be really "cool" with them. After Christmas I will let you know how my gift was received.  Charles Schulz has been a favorite of ours since the very beginning. 
 The shipping was fast and I got it within a few days of purchase. Thanks for having such a great movie in stock 
 This concise and well written book is the best kind of polemic; clear, well argued, and designed to provoke debate.  Bacevich is definitely interested in persuading readers of the truth of his views but his calm and invective free prose, insistence on careful documentation, and logical presentation indicate that his primary concern is promote a high level of discussion of this important issue.  Bacevich argues well that a form of militarism based on an exaggerated sense of both American mission and American power, specifically military power, has infected public life.  He views this militarism as both leading to unecessary and dangerous adventures abroad, epitomized by the Iraq fiasco, and corrupting the quality of domestic debate and policy making.  Beyond documenting the existence of this phenomenon, Bacevich is concerned with explicating how this form of militarism, which he views as contrary to American traditions, came to be so popular.  Bacevich argues well that the new militarism came about because of a convergence of actions by a number of different actors including our professional military, neoconservative intellectuals and publicists, evangelical Christians, resurgent Republican party activists, and so-called defense intellectuals.  For a variety of reasons, these sometimes overlapping groups converged on ideas of the primacy of American military power and the need to use it aggressively abroad.  Bacevich devotes a series of chapters to examining each of these actors, discussing their motivations and actions, often exposing shabby and inconsistent thinking.  Some of these, like the role of neoconservative intellectuals and the Religous Right, are fairly well known.  Others, like the behavior of professional military over the last generation, will be novel to many readers.  Bacevich's chapters have underlying themes.  One is the persisent occurrence of ironic events as the actions of many of these groups produced events counter to their goals.  The post-Vietnam professional military attempted to produce a large, vigorous military poised to fight conventional, WWII-like, combats.  This force was intended to be difficult for politicians to use.  But as these often highly competent professionals succeeded to restoring the quality of the American military, the temptation to use it became stronger and stronger, and control escaped the professionals back into the hands of politicians as varied as Bush II and Clinton.  Another theme is that politicians seized on use military force as an alternative to more difficult and politically unpalatable alternatives.  Jimmy Carter is described correctly as initiating the American preoccupation with control of the Persian Gulf oil supplies, which has generated a great deal of conflict over the past generation.  Bacevich presents Carter as having to act this way because his efforts to persuade Americans to pursue sacrifice and a rational energy policy were political losers.  Ronald Reagan is presented as the epitome of this unfortunate trend.   Bacevich is generally convincing though, perhaps because this is a short book, there are some issues which are presented onesidely.  For example, its true that Carter began the military preoccupation with the Persian Gulf.  But, its true as well that his administration established the Dept. of Energy, began a significant program of energy related research, moved towards fuel standards for vehicles and began the regulatory policies that would successfully improve energy efficiency for many household items.  No subsequent administration had done more to lessen dependence on foreign oil.   Bacevich also omits an important point.  As he points out, the different actors that sponsored the new militarism tended to converge in the Republican Party.  But, as has been pointed out by a number of analysts, the Republican Party is a highly disparate and relatively unstable coalition.  The existence of some form of powerful enemy, perceived or real, is necessary to maintain Republican solidarity.  The new militarism is an important component of maintaining the internal integrity of the Republican party and at unconciously appreciated as such by many important Republicans. An interesting aspect of this book is that Bacevich, a West point grad, former career Army officer, and self-described cultural conservative, has reproduced many of the criticisms put forward by Leftist critics.     Bacevich concludes with a series of interesting recommendations that are generally rational but bound to be controversial and probably politically impossible.  Again, this is an effort to change the nature of the discussion about these issues.  
 My daughter loves this book even though she is not adopted.  I am a single mom.  We read this book and talk about how parents really want to have children and how there are different types of families 
 ... so stop trying.  Dave Attell is dirty, dirty fun.  Attell is ten times dirtier than anything Andrew Dice Clay ever even considered, but he's at least one hundred times funnier 
 I love the new crop of comic artists in this country - the ones considered a little too subversive for mainstream media.  And Cartoonist Jen Sorensen is one of the best.  Her latest book is the perfect read for a politically burnt-out world.  Sorensen's observations, both political and social, are spot on.  Hilarious 
 I love this movie. I seen it when it first came out in 90 and fell in love with it. So I bought it. The music itself will make you get outta your seat and start dancing right then and there. But the Lambada dance itself is enticing and will have you craving for a dancing partner at the very moment. I give it 4 stars, also it sends out the cheezy cliche message about "if you want something bad enough, go and get it" 
 Best movie I've seen in years.  Typecast dwarf emerges as big complex character as he moves from big city to small town and we find out who he really is.  Big hearted small movie but hardly saccharin 
 I am an undergraduate engineering student, and I use this dictionary often. The entries vary in length from a sentence to a few pages. The explanations are well-written and understandable. All in all, a useful  reference 
 I don't want to spoil the plot of this book by giving away too many details. Basically, "A Kiss Before Dying" tells the story of a very ambitious man who is faced with a problem: he's managed to get his girlfriend Dorothy pregnant, and he'll stop at nothing in order to make his problem disappear...even if it means murder.  This novel is a quick read, and it's very suspenseful. Just when you think you have the whole thing figured out, Ira Levin throws another shocking curveball your way, which keeps you wondering until the very end. If you're a fan of mystery/suspense novels, this is one of the best in its class.  (Note: this is the second Levin book that I've read, "The Stepford Wives" being the first. Even though I think "A Kiss Before Dying" is a great book, I just couldn't get into it as much as "Stepford Wives." That's probably just because of my personal preference, though...and I still highly recommend this book. 
 Naked; excellent, relevant and reassuring! The voices embodied in these pages are representative of how every one of us feels at one time or another. The stories of conflict and resolution provide comfort. We are not alone ... we all struggle with the societal pressures of being a woman ... or being woman enough in a society obsessed with unhealthy, unrealistic ideals. Naked is a refreshing spark that encourages thinking about and discussing these issues, putting aside the Always-Strong-Black-Woman image to really begin analyzing and healing our battle scars. I am thankful that the book's contributors had the courage to put their experiences and fears out in the open for the benefit of us all. This book should be required reading for all women but especially for young women on the brink of full on women-hood and mothers of girls. 
 What a fantastic way to learn about John Adams! What a great way to be introduced to excellent historical biographical writing!  McCullough is a brilliant and exciting writer. He truly makes Adams come alive, and when Adams inevitably dies at the end it is a very sad thing!  Adams is truly a hero of the Republic. A great friend, then a great rival, then a great friend again of Thomas Jefferson, Adams is undeservedly overlooked by many students of American History.  Adams the republican vs Jefferson the populist was the great debate in American history and still continues today. Adams saw the horror of the French Revolution for what it was and predicted that it would end in depravity and violence and likely cause a savage reaction which would bring about the end of the French Republic itself. He was right, Bonaparte quickly followed the French Revolution and war across europe was the result. Jefferson on the other hand embraced the French Revolution as an expression of the people's desire for liberty. How wrong he was!  Adams was a brilliant Statesman, and student of history. A wonderful family man and superb husband Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail is a classic in American literature.  As a youth I spent many hours on the grounds of the Adams Mansion soaking up all the history there as much as is possible. McCullough does so well what so many biographers do so poorly and that is he captures the times of the subject and places the person in his rightful context. He brought me back to the grounds of "Peacefield" through his beautiful evocations of it as it hosted great people and great events.  History is best studied by understanding how historical figures lived and understood their own lives and times, as they lived them. Hindsight is an overrated tool in historiography.  Bringing the past to life in writing is a special gift and McCullough has it. Enjoy his talents and get to know the foundations of the American nation a story that is not fully known by so many. Adams' story deserves to be told. What a brilliant man, and McCullough does him superb justice in this highly readable biography.  So much can be said here about Adams, but it's not necessary as McCullough has written the definitive John Adams biography and says it better than I. Get to know John Adams through this superb book, you will be glad that you did. And your opinions on Jefferson will likely change, too! 10 STARS! 
 As an earlier poster has said, it seems that one chapter of this book is enough to keep you for a few months.  Practice from the book and you'll be seeing the peace that may foreshadow nibbana within the first week.  Describes the methods of practice with precision and is quick and to the point.  Both beginning and experienced meditators will be able to get something out of this book right away. Beginning students will become acquainted with the practice of vipassana meditation both in its spirit and detail, and experienced practitioners will find their practice renewed and with  greater discipline, peace, and well-being than before.  My only piece of advise:  once you are established in this concentrated meditation with peace and happiness as the result, especially while walking, do not let it go, for it is difficult to regain.  As the book suggests, keep meditating throughout the day, noting and being aware and observant of all sensations and movements, e.g. in washing your clothes, brushing your teeth, going out, or returning home.  And don't get stuck on levels where things seem "better," as the book warns, this is an impediment to further development.  Settle for nothing less than liberation 
 It is rare to be challenged by the television.  There are rare moments of interpersonal genius or occasionally a newscast that sheds light on impervious government releases.  This show refreshes the mind and helps us logically analyze things again.  Maybe after college, I slowly let my guard down after not engaging in so much debate.  Maybe the television has been so lopsided, I was complacent.  Regardless, this is one of the most important programs on the air today.  You do not need to agree with the show.  You just need to remember to think freely.  I have only seen two disks of the first season and two disks of the second.  The second season seems to be better paced and slightly more inflammatory in issues.  I'd recommend it initially over the first.  As I write this tidbit, I am buying all four currently available seasons.  Remember, the best way to argue is to know both sides.  Invest a small amount, increase your knowledge a huge amount.  I am so thankful this show exists. 
 Even if you aren't someone who loves the sea and its creatures, you have to love the main character for loving them. It's that contageous, and it is what gives this book its charm. It is superbly written, with depth and humor (recalling the sexually obsessed teen years). It is not a book I would ordinanrily pick, but it was recommended. I surprised myself and really enjoyed it 
 This book is timeless.  What transpired in the Nixon era is no different than what surely happens with every administration: legal issues, political adversaries, government policy and more. When you finish it, the odds are great that you'll want to pass it on to a friend 
 The Aquaclear power filters are the best in the market. These filters provide a HUGE surface area for an efficient biological treatment of the aquarium water. I own four of these filters and have been running continuously for more than three years! They are extremely quiet. I have experienced only two problems with these filters. First, the filters drain into the aquarium during power outages and will not restart on their own. Second, if not cleaned frequently the foam blocks will be pushed upwards and displace the cover. Overall, these are great filters and I would not replace them for another power filter 
 This right here is another instance of Disney finding spectacular literature, watering down its content, creating beautifully animated visuals and catchy songs to accompy the overall story, and packaging their final adaptation of the work into a wonderful product for the family-focused public.  Talk about a winning formula.  We can see that the cornerstone of this formula is "finding spectacular literature."  Milne's creation of Pooh and his buddies definitely fits this description.  Boy, can Disney pick'em or what?  About three minutes into this book I was laughing.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate humor that can stand on its own without constant references to celebrities or sex.  I also noticed that the dialogue was VERY Lewis Carroll-esque in nature with its non-sensical approach.  Then I found out Milne went to college on a mathematics scholarship.  I knew something was up.  Heck, one of the chapters even has a proof in it, entitled "Plan to Catch Baby Roo."  Don't rely on Disney to give you the whole Pooh story, check out the original for yourself by purchasing this first book of the series.  Heck, I might get me the entire Pooh literary collection now.  I was that impressed 
 I received my DVD in a timely manner and was package so it would not get damage, i would differently order again from the sende 
 The book is well documented and follows a logical approach based on a business project life cycle. It covers in fair detail a large number of issues that are faced by entrepreneurs. It can also be used as a general reference book for actual entrepreuneurs and businessman. The password of the OLC/PowerWeb card that came with the book was used and I could not register. Amazon is providing me with another copy of the book and a new OLC/PowerWeb 
 The story is wonderful and keeps the reader wonder to the last page of the story.  Even at the very end there is a small complex that rise, eventually everything get solved but with open questions.   For myself, the only question left to answer is, How come that Thomas' grandfather knows that Thomas is his grandson at the same time the grandson realises that?  I mean the grandfather was the one who wrote the story and he added the last bit after forgetting German, but he still knew about his grandson from Joker's note before Thomas got to read it! 
 I received everything in perfect condition and at a reasonable time. No problems here 
 Excellent product for those on a wheat free diet.  Have a hamburger again with a REAL bun!  Even better if you microwave for 20 seconds prior to eating.  Enjoy 
 One of Peters's best plots. Despite Cadfael's absence in the middle of the narrative, this chronicle kept my attention.  This is a deeply religious experience as Peters examines some of the origins of Christian dogma through her characters. As always it is Peters's style that sets it above the common mystery. Trurly one of the best of the Cadfael series 
 George Howe Colt has written an amazing book of a family hoping to hold on to the past through a home that truly is a "time machine." Things don't get fixed, or picked up or even updated for fear of changing what was into what could be. I loved this book and highly reccomend it to anyone who longs for the simplicity of childhood. 
 The title of this book is entirely misleading.  There is nothing whatsoever in the book pertaining to the politics of the playground, but a great deal of very good sense pertaining to how parents can assist their children to surmount developmental challenges.  Apart from the usual North American neurotic attitude towards sexuality (that surfaces in Chapter Seven) this book is sensible and instructive.  It avoids useless platitudes and instead provides parents with hands-on guidance that is neither foolish nor redundant.  Even those parents whose children are progressing satisfactorily will find much here to prompt their thinking in ways that will lead to even greater richness of parent-child interaction.  Along with "Siblings Without Rivalry" this is one of the must-have books for a parent's library 
 The detail Alton Brown goes into in this book can sometimes seem like too much if you have any idea how to cook.  Mostly this is a book on how to cook and the recipes really are not anything to special.  There are some interesting facts and stories in this book, but mainly it is all pretty basic.  Check it out if you like Alton Brown 
 Al pacino plays a detective who comes to nightmute alsaka to investigate A murderer then the shoot out incident detective dormer by mistake shoots his own partner and he tells them the murderer did it. He has real bad insomnia because of the everlasting daytime which he is not quite use to and with alot of guilt of shooting his partner. He creates fake evidence so they will think that the murderer (robin williams) did it. Very good movie 
 This book was written stunningly well with incredibly detailed descriptions.  I myself loved it and think that anybody with a taste for legends would love it themselves. The story is of a boy named Medraut.  Despite being the High King's first son, he is not heir to the throne due to an unfortunate birth.  Medraut grew up to be a strong, healthy young man with a head for politics and an arm for hunting.  His arching skills best even his father's.  Medraut thinks himself best to rule the kingdom, but his father thinks otherwise.  Medraut's sickly, weak half brother Lleu has stolen the king's heart away from Medraut. At first Medraut thinks not much of this as his father promises him to be Lleu's first hand man - even the High King knows that Lleu is arrogant and doesn't think things through.  Then Medraut's mother comes with her other four sons and corrupts Medraut's mind to doing the unthinkable. Medraut has always feared his mother - the physical and mental harm she had done him when he was young could never be forgotten. However, his mother has promised him kingship if only he will kidnap the High King's most beloved child, Lleu.  They plan to keep him as a ransom, so that the High King Artos will give in to Medraut's mother.  He complies, but Medraut had always taken care of sickly, pale Lleu.  Can he bear to harm him?  It's hard for him to kidnap Lleu and scare him so badly, but he does it...  However, if he can go through with it and demand kingship is for you to find out.  Read "The Winter Prince" and I promise you won't regret it 
 I have just finished reading this book in january 2006. I have read almost all of Clive Cussler's fiction books which are far better than his non fiction books. What I found interesting on this last few books I have read is that he mixes true facts with fiction. I have checked the concepts involved in this book in www.google.com and was amazed to find out that they are all true and exist and that is what makes this book so interest to read. I encourage reading it 
 I live on the Island of o'ahu and I found this book to be very helpful. I use this book to help name all five of my children. You can find all kinds of names in this book, from names for people to names for your pets and  even names for boats. There is even a section to translate your english  name into Hawaiian. This book is well worth the money!!!! To: Eileen M.  Root     A JOB WELL DONE!!!!!! 
 I hope the John found the closure he was looking for through the writing of this book.  May he rest in peace 
 This is awsome!!!! I play the piano all the time now. Stick to the status quo is the most fun to play. Here's a ranking list of the four main people in this movie ranked on their singing ability.   4: Lucas Grabeel - he's good but no wow factor  3: Ashley Tisdale - She's pretty good  2: Zac Efron - great  1: Vanessa Anne Hudgens - amazin 
 In this story, the fox has his tail cut off by a woman who is angry because the fox drank her milk.  The fox asks for his tail back and the woman says only if the fox returns her milk. Herein lies the tale.  The fox  embarks on a journey taking him to the cow who will give him milk only if  he is fed, which leads the fox to a field who will give up his grass only  if he receives water, which leads the fox to the ....and the tale goes on  and on.  The fox does eventually get his tail back.  My 3 year old son is  perplexed by this story and his listens with rapt attention. It is a good  bedtime story because the story builds on itself and the phrases are  repeated again and again and again.  This book also won a Caldecott Medal  for illustration.  Recommended 
 I will say I lied on the rating. It isn't a five star book. but they didnt have +10000000 stars, so i went with the highest. lol :) I love this series. I can't explain... But I have a need for this series. It is definitly my favorite series ever. The last one that was written the Sixth left off on this major cliffhanger.  But this series is excellent. It should be the first thing you read. It would be a great summer series, if you don't read a lot. you may finish it in a week though, because it is that addicting. trust me. a great series you don't want to let slip through your fingers. It's mainly about this teenager who has to save territories, which are like planets, from this villian named Saint Dane. it's not about dragons..so don't get thrown off by that if you don't like dragons. 
 I absolutely loved this book... it was so funny and amusing. Some parts were absolutely hilarious, especially when Liz overheard Jerome talking about her, and got so insaulted she picked out her gun, and when she signed up as Moses at the pilatesinstitute lol. Her weird thoughts reminded me a bit of myself. Anyway, i couldn't stop reading this book, and i recommend it highly to everyone 
 When Jordan Glass, a photographer known for seeking dangerous assignments, finds the lifeless form of her missing twin sister depicted in one of the paintings that are part of an exhibit of "sleeping women" in Hong Kong, little does she know that she is about to embark on a perilous journey searching for the connection between one or more artists and a series of kidnappings of women in New Orleans, including her sister.  Having been stonewalled by law enforcement personnel when her sister first disappeared, Jordan insists on being an integral part of an intensified investigation now conducted by the FBI. Through her eyes, the reader is treated to an inside look at FBI processes, including psychological profiling and the identification and questioning of suspects.   The characters are well sketched, including the suspects. The peculiarities of the art world and the predilections of its inhabitants is well explored. The dialogue can drag a bit, but not to the point of distraction. Jordan is a compelling character with the edge taken off her tough-girl routine just enough in her relations with FBI agent John Kaiser. The book does generally have a good pace with the ending flowing well from what has transpired. This book shows why Isles is regarded as one of the better writers in this genre.  
 How's this for a first? The first album in the "Essential" series consisting of various artists. Of the 41 tracks on this double-album only two of them were performed by Gershwin himself and one of them , the almost-fourteen minute "Rhapsody In Blue" was partially recorded some forty years after his death. The performers on this compilation read like a who's who of artists inspired by Gershwin's brilliant compositions. Singers like Billy Holiday have two tracks here as well as Tony Bennett, Fred Astaire and Andre Kostelanetz and His Orchestra. Georges Guetary has a song "I'll Build A Stairway To Paradise" which he performed in the 1951 film "An American In Paris". Oscar Levant also performed "Third Movement" in that same film though it had been recorded years earlier. Finally, Michael Feinstein who co-produced this album has a beautifully performed rendition of "Home Blues" which closes the second disc. There's an insightful essay by Tim Page and one by songwriter Diane Warren about the legacy he left behind. Although he passed away on 7/11/37 of a brain tumor at age 38 he left behind a huge body of work that continues to inspire today's musicians. This album can truly attest to that 
 I KNEW BARNEY ROSS WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAD GROWING UP IN THE SUBURS OF NEWARK NEW JERSEY.  BARNEY SUGERMAN Z'L, MY FATHER AND BARNEY ROSS WERE CLOSE CLOSE FRIENDS.  SUGIE AS MY FATHER WAS ALSO KNOWN WAS IN THE JUKE BOX AND GAME BUSINESS.  HE CAME OUT OF THAT VERY SPECIAL WORLD OF PROHIBITION, ROARING 20'S, PROUD JEWS INCLUDING MOBSTERS AND PRIZE FIGHTERS.  POP HAD HIS OFFICES AND BUSINESS ON JUKE BOX ROW, TENTH AVENUE AND 43RD STREET IN MANHATTAN.  BARNEY ROSS WAS AT THE OFFICE TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK AND AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK, THE TWO BARNEYS WOULD MAKE THE ROUNDS IN THE CITY.  DOUGLAS CENTURY DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF CONVEYING THE TRUE PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER OF BARNEY ROSS. THE BOOK IS OUTSTANDING.  IT CAPTURES THE TRUE SPIRIT OF BARNEY ROSS.  I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN BARNEY ROSS WOULD SAY HELLO TO YOU, IT MADE YOU FEEL YOU WERE SPECIAL.  HE HUGGED YOU, KISSED YOU, AND HE BLESSED YOU IN PERFECT HEBREW AND IN PERFECT YIDDISHE.  HE WAS A REAL PROUD JEW AND HE KNEW THAT HE CARRIED ON HIS SHOULDERS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF JEWISH PRIDE TO A NATION THAT HAD NOT YET FULLY ACCEPTED THE JEWISH PEOPLE.  IN FACT GROWING UP, ANTI SEMITISM WAS NOT A RARE OCCURENCE.  BARNEY CARRIED THE CROWN OF JEWISH PRIDE WHEREVER HE WENT.  I WILL TELL ONE STORY.  IN THE MID 50'S I WAS A STUDENT AT BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY WHICH WAS A SCHOOL ASSOCIATED WITH THE BAPTISTS.  IN THOSE DAYS, THERE WAS A LIMIT ON JEWS GOING TO BUCKNELL, WE HAD A 5% QUOTA.  SO WE HAD ONE JEWISH FRATERNITY HOUSE.  IN MY JUNION YEAR, 1958, WE HAD AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THE ANNUAL SPORTS EVENING.  ALL THE ATHLETES OF THE SCHOOL WENT TO THE ANNUAL DINNER.  SOMEBODY KNEW THAT MY FATHER AND BARNEY ROSS WERE CLOSE FRIENDS, AND THE SCHOOL BOXING COMMITTEE ASKED ME IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO INVITE BARNEY ROSS TO COME UP TO THE SCHOOL TO GIVE A SPEECH.  I CALLED POP.  HE SPOKE TO BARNEY ROSS.  BARNEY RIGHT AWAY SAID OF COURSE HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO IT.  THAT WAS BARNEY ROSS.  THE WORD "NO" DIDN'T EXIST IN HIS VOCABULARY.  I TOLD POP TO MAKE SURE HE WAS UP BY 4 OR 4.30 BECAUSE THE DINNER WAS SCHEDULED FOR 6 PM.  POP PICKED BARNEY UP EARLY IN THE MORNING.  IT WAS NO MORE THAN A 4 HOUR DRIVE UP THROUGH ROUTE 22 TO MAKE IT TO LEWISBURG PENNSYLVANIA.  BUT NO SIGN OF THE TWO BARNEYS AND BY 5 PM. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE SCHOOL. FINALLY AT SIX PM ON THE DOT THE BIG BLUE FOUR DOOR CADILLAC PULLED UP AND OUT CAME BARNEY ROSS WITH BARNEY SUGERMAN.  BARNEY ROSS SMELLED LIKE HE FELL INTO A BATH TUB OF WHISKEY.  I ASKED POP WHAT THE HELL TOOK HIM SO LONG.  POP EXPLAINED THAT BETWEEN NEW YORK CITY AND LEWISBURG PENNSYLVANIA BARNEY ROSS INSISTED ON STOPPING IN EACH TOWN AND HAVE A DRINK.  AS SOON AS HE WALKED INTO A BAR  IN THOSE LITTLE BLUE COLLAR TOWNS IN NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA, GUYS IMMEIDATELY RECOGNIZED HIM AND BEFORE LONG, "BARNEY HAVE ANOTHER DRINK ON THE HOUSE, AND TELL US ABOUT THE FIGHT WITH TONY CANZONERI, WITH JIMMY MC LARNIN, ETC."    WE BROUGHT BARNEY INTO OUR SAMMY HOUSE FRATERNITY.  HE WAS SURROUNDED BY ALL THE GUYS IN THE FRATERNITY WHO WANTED TO SAY HELLO TO BARNEY ROSS AND SHAKE HIS HAND, ETC.  BARNEY ROSS HOWEVER WAS THREE SHEETS TO THE WIND. I WAS WONDERING HOW THE HELL HE WAS GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH AT THE SPORTS NIGHT EVENT.    WE WENT TO THE DINNER.  THE PLACE WAS MOBBED WITH ALL THE JOCKS AT BUCKNELL.  NATURALLY, THE VAST MAJORITY WERE NOT JEWISH.  BARNEY GOT UP TO SPEAK.  HE HUGGED THE MICROPHONE AND HE STARTED TO SPEAK.  HE SPOKE SO QUIETLY, BUT SO ELOQUENTLY AND SO PASSIONATELY ABOUT HIS LIFE GROWING UP AS A JEWISH BOY IN CHICAGO, HIS FATHER'S TRAGIC MURDER, HIS ENTRY INTO BOXING, HIS CAREER, HIS FIGHTS, HIS WAR TIME EXPERIENCE, HIS DRUG ADDICTION AS A RESULT OF THE WOUNDS HE SUFFERED DURING THE BATTLE AT GUADACANAL AND HIS STUGGLE TO BEAT THE HABIT.  THAT EVENT TOOK PLACE NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AGO.  I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT HAPPENED TONIGHT.  BARNEY ROSS WAS A CHAMPION AS A FIGHTER, BOTH IN THE RING AND IN THE BATTLEFIELD BUT THAT NIGHT HE WAS A CHAMPION OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE.  KOLHAKAVOD TO DOUGLAS CENTURY.  HIS BOOK IS A TRIBUTE TO THE TRUE CHARACTER OF BARNEY ROS 
 Roger Volkema's book about leverage provides an excellent overview of the many types of leverage involved in the bargaining process, with exercises and examples to illustrate the concepts and teach the reader how to master the art of negotiation.

The methodology and principles outlined in this book can easily be applied to any situation. By providing the reader with a broad scope of information regarding leverage and negotiation techniques, and exercises with which to develop proficiency in managing power and advantage, this book is a superb and insightful resource for professionals at all skill levels.  
 I bought this book together with McKay "The Definitive Guide to Plone" and all I can say is that they fit together nicely.   In the old days when software was delivered to you in a nice box with accompanying manuals, one of them was hopefully titled as "Getting started...", "Introduction to..." or "Quick guide to...".  Julie's "Plone Content Management Essentials" is by all means *that* kind of the book in a 'missing box' for Plone.   As a complete Plone (Zope) newbie on my way to migrate some stuff from Movable Type intranet site, I needed quick, concise guide to get the general feeling about Plone features and the level of complexity involved (I already knew that Zope behind the Plone is a "beast" in it's own if compared to simple packages like MT) . With just 200+ pages this book helped me grasp the basic concepts behind the Plone CMS in a way, that I could build my prototype site in a few days. The chapters that I liked the most are chapter "4. Additional Plone Elements" describing Plone add-ons of immediate interest to me (CMFBoard, CMFPhotoAlbum and CMFWeblog)  and chapter's 5 and 6 on customizing plone and implementing custom skin. The only objection that I have about the book is Appendix A., imho it's completely useless attempt on introduction to python language (it would make more sense to just publish the links to python online resources).  Book is geared towards complete Plone newbie's, even non-techies will not be easily lost, thanks to step-by-step approach and numerous screenshots. Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend that you also consider McKay "The Definitive Guide to Plone" which is in my opinion the most complete book about Plone on the market (but you'll certainly need more than a few days to digest it). Thank you for reading this review 
 I enjoy Howare Shore's brilliance when it comes to music and  this soundtrack was a must have for my collection after I saw the movie.  The quiet, subtle yet hauntingly chilling songs are yet another masterful work of art created by Shore.  This CD is well worth it 
 This movie works on many levels, and is a lot more sophisticated than one initial viewing might indicate. As a Marketplace seller, I was planning on selling it. But I am going to add this little gem to my collection. Highly recommended 
 Haven't seen this yet - Christmas gift - but am sure it will be enjoyed by our grandsons 
 I probably can't really add much to the nearly 300 reviews before me. This is the most comprehensive cookbook you will ever own, I imagine. The quality of the book seems fine to me, and I am most definitely a book person. Usually I don't buy cookbooks because I create my own recipes or find them online, but this is so much more than just a cookbook. If you only buy one, this might be it 
 Action packed and fun to watch.  My kids loved it 
 This book is a little weird (to me) in concept but it works out really well in the end. The book goes from Bill's early days in Nazi Germany all the way to his death with no major stone left unturned. Lots of great stories with very little in the way of punches being pulled. I mean Bill really tells you what he is thinking. Very uncensored. Covers the drugs and the behind scenes stuff with no BS involved. Shows the guy for who he was, warts and all and lets him and the people he is talking about retort one another which I thought was weird in a good way. This book is of great interest to anyone who has probably gotten to this point in reading reviews. If you are interested in this type of subject then this book is a must. 
 Growing up, all I knew about legendary college basketball coach Bobby Knight was that he would rant and rave, throw chairs, get arrested, scream in his players' faces and snap at the media. During college, upon taking a class called "Moral Reasoning In Sport," I conducted research on Bobby Knight and got to know Bobby Knight as a person better. The ironic thing was that he stood for good morals but what he practiced as a coach boardered on the immoral at times. I saw how wonderful a man he could be and how badly he could cut a person down. I was fascinated by his style.  My curiosity about Bobby Knight led me to "A Season On The Brink;" a book which describes the full 1985-86 season with Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers. Author John Feinstein, who trooped along with the team complete with notepad and tape recorder, crafts this book in amazing detail with all the trimmings. We are given a real life look at the pressures that college basketball can bring to both coach and players, the trials and tribulations. We are given a taste of how addictive competition is and the emotional effects it can have.  "A Season On The Brink" describes Bobby Knight in a way that begs you to love him and begs you to hate him. Passionate about not failing, Knight pressures himself to succeed and is quick to think himself a failure each time he does not reach certain goals. His characteristic short fuse is always there to represent this. After the disastrous 1984-85 season where he performed the legendary chair throw that got him in trouble, he vowed not to go through a repeat season in 1985-86. He constantly reminded his players of that terrible season as fuel for them to create a better season in '85-'86.  We are literally taken to the "brink" of Knight's sanity at times as Feinstein describes Knight's techniques for getting his team prepared for games. The saga continues before each game for the Indiana players, from studying hours of opponent game tape in "the cave," to "walk-throughs" on the court of what will be conducted in the upcoming game, to appetizing pre-game meals of spaghetti and pancakes in the early morning. Practices are grueling as the players are screamed at by Knight; virtually every four-letter word flying in their faces each time one fails to get a certain rebound, set a certain screen or make a decent pass.   Then of course there are always the Bobby Knight mind games present, a term that Feinstein calls "B.K. Theater." Players like his all-stars, Steve Alford and Daryl Thomas will be targets of his ranting and raving of how horrible they are, how they don't care about playing and how he should never have gotten players like them on his team. You did not want to land in Knight's "doghouse" as Feinstein describes it. In fact, on some of Knight's worst days, the whole team is in the doghouse as he throws all of them out of practices while yelling his questioning of their commitment to the game.  Feinstein does an excellent job of describing the games themselves from the tension in the locker room before the game, during halftime and after the game, to the crowd noise and chants, to the arguments Knight has with officials. As for the players themselves, Feinstein chronicles virutally every key shot, mistake made, rebound and beautiful pass. As you read the book, you'll find your heart pounding as Indiana fights for the lead or fights to keep their lead as the clock quickly winds down to crunch time. You'll find yourself cheering for star players like Steve Alford when he drains another key shot and for Cinderella players like Steve Eyl when he makes two clutch free-throws.  But you'll also feel the despair the players feel if a win has not been grasped or a goal has not been reached, from the chilling silence of the locker room, to Knight screaming and storming out of it only to come back in and talk calmly. Sometimes Knight will resort to taking off to fish or hunt with friends, attending other basketball games or letting the other coaches run the team for a while, while he watches from the stands. And of course there are the situations that the players bring on themselves that creates tension and stress such as Alford's posing for a calander, Daryl Thomas's injuries and Andre Harris's skipping of classes.  You'll find out what Bobby Knight goes through with the media; how his past record continues to follow him and how the media jumps to conclusions and exaggerating. You'll also see Knight's recruiting process (players from high school and junior college) and the ups and downs that come with it. You'll hear Knight's own insecurity through talks with his other coaches over meals at late-night diners, on the plane trips and before games with words like "Do you think we're okay?" "Will we win again?" You will see Knight marking up important words on the chalkboard and trying different defensive and offensive set-ups that he wouldn't have done in the past. In short, you'll hear it, you'll feel it and you'll see it all.  But one thing that Feinstein enables us to see is the loveable Bobby Knight; he Bobby Knight who doesn't forget past players that he has befriended such as Quinn Buckner. The Bobby Knight who sympathized with a deaf kid and gave he and his family tickets to the basketball game. The Bobby Knight whom past players and friends call upon for advice or to have some strings pulled. As Feinstein pointed out in the book, nobody could have a more loyal friend than Bobby Knight. You ask him to do something and he would do just about anything for you. And granted we see plenty of Knight's softer side around his players from Steve Alford's final game as a Hoosier, to the heartfelt goodbye to Delray Brooks who would transfer to another school. And of course you'll really get a taste of Bobby Knight's sense of humor and quick wit. When times are going a little smoother for the team, you'll read of Knight making cracks with his coaches and players.  Feinstein even takes us right down the path to the crucial tournament games with heated rivals Ohio State and Michigan. The read is quite a nail-biting experience. Feinstein follows the chronicled 1985-86 season up with a fairly quick but detailed overview of the 1986-87 team on the way to a championship against Syracuse, where you will again start getting onto the court with the players as the key plays of this amazing championship game are described by Feinstein. Headed by new recruits such as a kid named Smart, the Hoosiers took home a championship and rendered Knight literally hoarse with emotion in the end.  Indeed, if you are a fan of sports and you love the game of basketball; especially the thrill of college basketball, you will love this book. Even for those who may despise Bobby Knight, I would still recommend you give this book a read. It's a wonderful basketball story and a read that gets you right into the heated games and the hardened practices with the team. It could quite possibly be the best trip to the brink a sports fan could want. 
 Richard Webster has written some of the best books available on metaphysical subjects.  This book is no exception. Palm Reading for Beginners is a great way to learn the basics of this ancient craft, from the shape of the hands, to what can be gleaned from the lines of the palm, and how to approach a hand reading in a professional manner.  I highly recommend this work to anyone who wants to learn the correct way to paractice palmistry 
 I read this book when it was first published in 1961.  I loved the stories in it then, and I still re-read it every couple of years just for the sheer pleasure of it.  At one point in time, I had two copies because I kept loaning it out to other people who also became devoted fans.  I am not a pilot, nor ever wanted to be one; but I came close just by reading this book.  Even now, since considerably downsizing my library upon retirement, this remains a permanent fixture on the shelves.  I urge everyone to read this book at least once just to discover the enjoyment of great storytelling. 
 Read this before you go to the doctor! It explains how to work with your doctors, rather 	than against them, to get the care you need.   It points out why the red tape exists, why the 		doctors are bound by  it, and how the two of you can get around it.  This book should be issued  to every patient.  It will benefit doctors and patients alike 
 A friend of a freind of a friend passed this book to me.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  The book is not just for those who are caring for elder parents or grandparents.  It is beautiful literature.  The story  called Margie's Discount was beautifully written, insightful, and moving.   (This is the second thing I have read by BK Loren, but cannot find a book  by this author.) Though it was so different, I also liked To Kill A Deer.   It was funny and sad and right on target about parents.  I recommend this  book as general reading.  I do not have aging parents, but if I did, I  would think this book would be essential.  I think it is essential already,  as just the stories are beautifully told 
 I think every young child should see this wonderous film. I am 59 and want to see it again. It really humanizes milo and otis. The photography is fabulous 
 Many people who grew up or lived through the 70's gender identity crisis here in the US have adopted certain kinds of stories about the relationship between men and women.  Women are the victims of male oppression.  Women need to be protected from men.  Often cited in support of this view are studies that show girls don't get called on as often as their male classmates, women are discriminated against in the workplace and suffer from unfair expectations about the division of labor at home.  While it is true that we can improve the lot of women in society, Gurian makes the argument that we should avoid thinking that because society has been unkind to women, it must be nice to men who are the villians of society.  Society isn't very kind to boys either:  Boys, not girls, are more likely to be victims of violent crime in school; on average, girls today have higher educational aspirations than their male classmates, as many boys aspire to manual labor jobs like carpentry or plumbing; girls, not boys have better self-esteem through most of their school years; girls, not boys tend to get better grades overall; in total, there are more women in graduate programs in the US than men.  Even today, when we send citizens to fight in wars, those armed forces are predominantly male.  Lastly, societal expectations and norms both at home and at work prevent many men in the US from enjoying fully who they are as humans... rewarding them for being the "strong silent types" who deny their emotions and are not allowed to develop fully their social skills in a way that expresses their unique qualities as men.  Society isn't treating most men very well either.   Gurian's book makes the case that the path to a healthier society involves improving conditions for boys as well.  For both men *and women* who are interested in improving gender relations in their community or even just understanding the male half of the population, this book is a well-written, thought-provoking read. 
 The instructor I took field biology with in college highly recommended this book.  He thought it was by far the best guide for identifying trees.  Now, years later and having used (or attempted to use) many different field guides, I know why he was so crazy about this book.  Winter or summer, if you are looking at the bark, leaf, or bud, the very clear and detailed pictures and unambiguous text will allow you to identify any tree with certainty.  
 Alfred A. Cave presents us with a quick moving, concise, and interesting narrative of the Pequot War.  This is significant in and of itself since it is the first notable narrative of the war in almost a century.  Cave attempts to correct the early historiography that was very sympathetic to the Puritans, and also tries to temper the interpretations of later historians that viewed the conflict as being caused solely by Puritan greed.  Cave argues that the latter interpretation wrongfully diminishes the significance of Puritan ideology as a cause of the war.    Economics did play a role, but it was not a simple case of Puritans versus Pequots.  Instead, there was fierce competition between various tribes, as well as the Dutch and English for control of the trade in the Connecticut Valley.  Essentially, English plans to extend into Connecticut conflicted with Pequot desires to defend their interests.  However, Cave sees that ideology, not Puritan greed or Pequot aggression caused the war.  Puritans viewed the natives as "savages" and "children of the Devil," and, therefore, were the Devil's earthly servants deserving destruction.  Cave argues that this worldview served as the catalyst for provoking a war with the Pequots.    Cave tends to take this interpretation a little too far.  His efforts at correcting the excesses of past scholarship is appreciated, but leaves one wondering why a people so bent on the destruction of Native Americans, allied themselves with the Narragansetts against the Pequots.  Nonetheless, this is a very good and interesting book. 
 You will laugh yourself silly!  I was laughing so hard my kids wanted to know what I was laughing at.  They joined me and now we walk around saying many of his punchlines. Billy Graham says on the back of the DVD "You will be blessed.."  He was right.  
 Fox has announced that the DVD of "Bedazzled" will be released in the US on April 3, 2007.  No word yet on extras.  Problaby none. 
 This is my favourite book. I had to pause after reading each story, to let  it's full meaning and beauty sink into my soul 
 YO check out the sound clips off this CD..  For those of you who have never heard LPG; These guys represent tha REal HIP HOp.  Forget that secular stuff, JUrny and DAx are 2 of the illest  battle rappers to date.  Although they  may seem underground these guys are worthy of acclaim in the rap industry game.  Every song on this CD is off the hook and will blow you away.  Just listen to the lyrics...closey and u will see that thes guys make MTV "rappers" looks like nobodys!  Although these guys have taken a lot of heat in the christian industry... they keep true to the word and u will never question their sincerity.  Do yourself a favor and cop this album. it will be the one cd you won't stop listening to! 
 The "Governator" shares his bodybuilding secrets while offering inspiration, not just for bodybuilding, but also for life 
 Man! Is this the greatest record or what!? I've never heard singing (and  sometimes yodeling) that's so authentic and deeply felt. I've never heard  acoustic country guitar playing that sounds so pure despite the very  formidable technique used. Doc is very much a 'progressive' musician,  strongly influenced by blues and jazz players; yet he never strays too far  from the DEEP ROOTS which are his foundation. These roots are 'backwoods'  country, but as unmistakably American as Mark Twain, John Wayne, Apple Pie  and Norman Rockwell combined. The songs here run the gamut from the most  beautifully and heatbreakingly sad possible ("Alberta"), to the  most peaceful and mellow imaginable ("Southbound"),' to joyful  instrumental odes ("Nashville Pickin',""Sweet Georgia  Brown,"), and a stoically triumphant and hilarious yodeling classic  ("Never No More Blues.") All in all, one of the best records in  my collection and the ABSOLUTE ANTITHESIS of all the garbage peddled by the  millions in country music today 
 I really enjoyed this book because of its fast pace and very involved plot.  Philip Marlowe is really at his best here.  By the end he has been beaten, manipulated, and framed for murder but manages to solve the mystery and come out as clean as a fat man's plate.  One major element of the plot was a bit obvious however, namley the identity of the lady in the lake.  There was still much to be revealed and discovered.  This may be my favorite of the Marlowe series thus far.  They are all great, so that is saying something 
 A very beautiful album of Johnny Mercer musi 
 This book of Helen Levitt's brilliant color photographs is a treasure.  I grew up in the city, and looking through this book, I was immediately transported back to the sights, smells, sounds and feelings of my childhood. These sensitive street scenes are wonderful social documents and pure poetry. 
 I purchased this book for my husband who had injured his back lifting carpet from our family room. The book had come highly rcommended by our neighbor who had restored her back from long-time pain using the techniques and zones of this book. My husband also successfully found the trigger points that lifted the localized pain and he began the process of healing. We are very grateful to our neighbor and very happy to recommend this book to others! 
 This book "Achieve Sales Excellence" provides pragmatic, real world perceptions of customers about the sales professional and the selling process. For years, we have emphasized the importance of understanding customer needs, while striving to exceed their expectations.This book defines with great clarity what is really important to business customers. It highlights the significance of the sales professional and provides a roadmap for establishing priorities........both for the sales professional and their company. It's great! 
 Brought back some great memories of my childhood that I want to share with my own children. Made me want to start my engine....Anyone can ride on the see-the-same thing interstates, but riding along Route 66...now thats entertainment, thats a feast for your eyes, thats a great ride! 
 20 years latter after the The King's Buccaneer we return to Krondor to find a brand new cast of characters that won't disappoint you. The start of a new campaign to stop the evil that is across the ocean. Another Feist 5 +++ star book 
 Clayton Riddell, on his way home to surprise his family with news of his first financial success as a graphic artist, is thrust into a fight for his life when terrorists (presumably) send a "pulse" through cell phones that make anyone who hears it...well...a little weird. Clayton and a small group of other survivors must start a journey home to find Clayton's son and resist the calling of the "Raggedy Man" and the other "pulsed" zombies.  What a joy to have Stephen King come back to his Horror roots.  The frights are not nearly as scary as his past novels such as "Carrie", "It" or "Salem's Lot", but there was more gore than any book since "Pet Semetary".  Using technology to terrorize or attack a society is not a new theme, but leave it to Stephen King to twist the theme into a zombie story and the fear of society turning on itself.  The Cell could have easily been a 1,000 page epic like "The Stand", but Mr. King purposely kept it light at a slim 350 pages to keep it fun, and fun it is.    There were many parts that I wished the novel would spin off into Mr. Kings famous detours from the main story.  For instance, a back story on Jordan and the Head would have been entertaining I am sure.  Also, some of the leaps of faith the reader has to make is much more abrupt than other King novels, such as when Clayton sketches his dream and how quickly the "survivors" understand the nature of the "pulse" and its effect.  Overall a fun book that seems to harken back to Stephen King's roots 
 I found this book very wise. I especially appreciated the biographical information provided, taking us on Mr. Dispenza's spiritual journey from his early life ephiphanies to decision to enter a monastery to his departure and ongoing evolving spirituality outside of "organized" religion. Historically people are always seeking to understand our place in the universe and to find meaning. Life, especially as we age,  is a personal "mine field" and these days, given what's happening in our planet both good and bad, there is a hunger for ways of reaching God and or/personal meaning in our lives. It's a search for roots and connection and an evolving evaluation of our own unique narratives.  Mr. Dispenza did not merely "dispense" with organized religion, his path was an evolving one, as are so many of our journeys, requiring as it did, his own changing consciousness. He writes with wisdom about other paths, such as the path some people took in the sixties and beyond toward spiritual enlightenment through mind altering drugs like LSD and through mushrooms. I could relate to this having lived through that sixties time of turmoil and I was fascinated by the study of people who took mind altering drugs in the spiritual environment of Marsh Chapel, how this affected their future spiritual outlook. I am living in the house Dr. Timnothy Leary lived in years ago when he was doing these Harvard experiments so I found this research particularly interesting.  I want to laud this book for both its honesty and its truth and also in providing some answers to seekers along the path. There are many forks in the road. Mr. Dispenza provides a nourishing book for those among us who  are not sure they want to continue with traditional structures, but who are, nonetheless hungry to find others like them, who have chosen a different, and equally valid route toward this difficult quest for meaning, which of course begets, answers and ongoing questions.  I enjoyed this book so much I wrote to the author and he responded in "kind" 
 This latest effort from the "post-Bruce Hampton"-ARU is a magnificent effort by a greatly overlooked band that managed to produce some of the greatest and most inspiring musicians of their generation.  Jimmy Herring (The Dead, Phil And Friends), Oteil Burbridge (Allman Brothers), Kofi Burbridge (Derek Trucks Band), along with vocalist Paul Henson and drummer Sean O'Rourke just kill from the opening track throughout.  Great songs, great performances.  Highlights?  All of 'em!!  Guests include Derek Trucks and legendary percussionist, Count M'Butu.  This is an AWESOME c 
 This is a great collection from one of my favorite bands. It has all the hits. A new version of "Some Velvet Morning." There is a bonus remix disc that looks promising. I prefer the albums themselves. Primal Scream is a band that doesn't have a lot of lousy songs. This is a good CD, but I suggest listening to the whole story. This is only the beginning 
 Cameron Crowe, Rene Zelleweger, Cuba Gooding and Tom Cruise were all at the top of their game. The superlative fluidity and cinematic thrill of this successful feature was facilitated by experienced actors in sync, and guaranteed by superb production and studio crafts. A timeless classic - In a class of its own. 
 Missionary Stew by Ross Thomas is a wickedly irreverent satiric novel that is both fast paced and hilarious. There are two main characters, Draper Haere and Morgan Citron.  Haere makes his living in the world of politics.  He's not a politician himself.  Rather he operates behind the scenes to advance the agendas of politicians he works for.  Morgan Citron is an investigative reporter who has been traumatized by a rather unpleasant 13 month stay in an African jail and is conflicted about returning to work. An incident of some sort has ocurred in a Central American country.  The details of this incident are sketchy, but it seems that whenever someone learns what has happened, that person winds up dead.   Haere's current client is Baldwin Veatch, the governor-elect of California and a presidential hopeful.  Haere has reason to believe that the incident being covered up constitutes an embarassing scandal for the sitting President.  Therefore, if he can expose the secret, his client's chances of becoming President will be greatly enhanced. So, Haere hires Citron to use his investigative skills to unravel the mystery. The plot of Missionary Stew is exceedingly complex.  As the narrative advances, the reader learns of all manner of complications.  Playing key roles are: a redneck Floridian drug runner, the CEO of a National Inquirer type tabloid who happens to be Citron's own mother, a corrupt Central American general, as well as various and sundry members and ex-members of the intelligence community. Suffice it to say that the book's characters are all very interesting and delightfully eccentric.  Moreover, the dialogue is quite snappy and has an understated wit about it that is genuinely entertaining. If you like your political novels to have byzantine plots, quirky characters, clever dialogue and cynical points of view, by all means read this book.  You'll love it.     
 80 pages, 121 beautiful color photos, some black & white photos plus four do-it-yourself projects.  An excellent reference for design ideas.  Covers basic elements of Japanese design to include entryway, veranda,  interior space, tatami and shoji.  The pictures alone make this a good  sourcebook 
 This book is a complete sacred sex course in itself. With lots of meditations, activities, and exercises, it is particularly suited for couples who want to open up to each other emotionally as well as physically 
 I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part. The first thing you'll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is.  This is a slider phone, and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys. The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number that's not in your contacts and to text message.   Next, we go to the features.  So we got a 1.3MP camera, camcorder, music player, 1GB microSD card, bluetooth support, and infrared port..and *drumroll please* an FM radio.  Now, the FM radio isn't satellite based, so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the U.S., just those stations local to you.  Now I will go into the good and bad things about each feature:  1.  Camera - Impressive picture quality. Yes it's only 1.3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras, but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does? 5/5  2.  Camcorder - Not all that impressive.  While you are recording, the quality seems perfect.  However, once you play it, it turns a bit distorted.  Plus, it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card. 3/5  3.  Music Player - Impressive.  The speaker is of good quality, and very loud.  However, I still could not find a way to change the order of the songs without making a playlist.  There's play, pause, next song, previous song, fast forward, and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures. The buttons must be pressed fairly hard, so your music won't start playing spontaneously in your pocket. Also, I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds. 4/5  4. FM Radio - I bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement.  Well, the truth is you don't need to buy anything extra.  Just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone, and this will serve as an 'antenna' and will allow you to hear stations. And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio, yes the sound will go to the earbuds. However, there's a 'loudspeaker' option that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker, but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in, as it serves as the 'antenna'.  This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone, you NEED to have the earbuds with you. You may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna (or you may have to move) in order to get clear reception. 3/5  Misc. Info:  Only two games to included, and both trials. (Lumines, Texas Hold'em)  You can't transfer games from another phone. You must pay and download them again.  You can't delete the pre-created profiles (those that come with the phone). You can just create your own.  In order to change the phone to vibrate, you must make a vibrating profile. Then to use it, it takes several steps, which is not hard, but inconvenient.    The interface shows the month and date, but not the day of the week.  Only two face templates included with the phone.  That's all for now.  Overall: 4/ 
 Listen to this CD and re-discover why Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers are a quintessential American band on par with Bruce Springsteen & the E-Street Band, the Eagles, the Byrds, the Doors, or any other rock titan you care to name.  Forget the fact that TP&H are a superb album-rock outfit that never loads an album with filler...forget the fact that this one disc cannot possibly contain all of the great TP&H tracks...what this disc does showcase is a phenomenal lineup of classic rock songs that keep coming and coming and coming at you, like waves at the seashore.  A little bit Florida redneck and a little bit California cool, Tom Petty embodies a coast-to-coast-to-coast ethos that appeals to folks from everywhere--everywhere geographically, spiritually, socially, vocationally, and musically.  This one disc contains old-time rock and roll, blues, country, soul, psychadelia, jangly pop, Beatlesque songcraft, Elvis-like swagger, Byrdsian harmony, and Stones-ish ragged glory.  And it's all owned by TP&H...these guys aren't imitators as much as they are a repository of the great American/British jukebox.  Included are most of TP&H's biggest chart hits, plus a few of TP's solo songs from FULL MOON FEVER and two new recordings available only (when it was released, anyway) on this set.  From the "Byrds Go Punk" gallop through "American Girl" to the New-Wavey "You Got Lucky" (the Cars meet Dylan) to those classic TORPEDO tracks and the fantastic Jeff Lynne era, it's all pretty much represented here.  PLAYBACK, the epic TP 6-disc box, covers the band more fully, but for a succinct overview of the band up through the early 1990s, it's tough to beat this gazillion-selling HITS collection.  
 A very creative way to teach money concepts.  I liked the way the book reviews the way to make change.  I read this to a group of 3rd graders.  I don't know that they found the book entertaining, but it did help them review money.  I think 2nd graders would probably enjoy the story more, but may not understand all of the math concepts as well as the third graders. I thought the part with the pigs trying to figure out what they could buy etc was a great way to show children how important it is to understand money.  Coin especially can be difficult for children (a quarter is the same as two dimes and a nickel, etc). I would definitely use this book as a review, or an extention to a lesson, not an introduction to money 
 When I first began homeschooling my children I came across this book. Since we were to soon see a high school production of Midsummer's Night Dream I read the Lamb version aloud to them before seeing the performance. The results were amazing.  My children had no previous exposure to Shakespeare. The Lamb's ability to retain some of Shakespeare's original language greatly enhanced their comprehension. They loved the story and we able to follow the play with ease, laughing and clearly enjoying themselves much to the frustration of some nearby adults who were completely lost.  This book helped begin their love affair with Sir William.  I am of the opinion reading a well summarized version of his plays and then watching a well done performance will make any child appreciate the genius that is Shakespeare's work 
 This a great photography book, but the parcel in which it was sent was not strong enough, and the book arrived a little bit damaged 
 Modern phsyics gives us Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.  For the lay reader, the plethora of popularizations out there can be daunting.  But, having read the lion's share of all of them myself, I'd recommend to you only a handful:  QM: Nick Herbert's "Quantum reality" Strings: Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe" Everything: Roger Penrose's "the Road to Reality"  Relativity: This book by Einstein!  Einstein's presentation is so clearly stated and concise.  His presentation of what he's thinking is so simple that you'll find you too can visualize just what he's explaining... at the end of the book, you'll find that it actually makes sense... not only that, it makes perfect sense and you'll understand just why the theory had to come about.  The beauty of relativity (as opposed to QM and Strings) is that it IS accessible to us mere mortals and it IS a sensible and beautiful theory, once you strip away everything else and just think about.  That's what Einstein brilliantly helps you to do here. 
 For a novel without much action, intrigue or romance, "One True Thing" catches your attention and holds it until you turn the last page.  This skillfully woven drama tells of the evolving relationship between a young woman, her ailing mother and emotionally detached father.  Ellen Gulden unwillingly gives up her life and career to return home to look after her mother, and finds that there are many things she never knew about the deceptively strong and proud woman.  During the caring and bonding process, Ellen learns to cook, craft, and generally take over her mother's role in the house, while her cynical and sharp edges are unobtrusively smoothed away.  The death of her mother brings a new set of problems, and while Ellen insists on her innocence, she is accused of a terrible crime. During this trying period, her relationships with the people closest to her change considerably, leading to an unexpected ending.     Amanda Richards, December 26, 2005 
 Enlightening. Mind shifting. A great book if you want to look at your life different and take some of the lids off of your beliefs. Worth the money for anyone who wants to live financially free without someone trying to give you some kind of formula to follow. This book is all about finding the financial freedom through yourself. 
 Once in a while, a movie with a lame story line will be elevated by the tremendous efforts of one of the cast members. This is the case with Ace Ventura, a film about a pet detective hired to find an abducted dolphin who happens to be the mascot for the Miami Dolphins.  The movie is silly, and the story line (and its conclusion) is utterly ridiculous, but Jim Carrey is so darn funny that you don't mind that the script writing is inept and juvenile. So is Carrey, and he is great!  If you like Jim Carrey, you'll love this movie, which turned out to be his breakthrough into cinema stardom. If you hate Jim Carrey, then you will hate this movie as well.  
 It is great that he strives to revive the so called American Dream and inspire more people to adhere to the traditional values and principles. I am not sure whether he has potential for the White House but he is successful enough, influential enough and I think that his book adds to his current work. After all, you cannot really understand someone's point of view just by listening a speech. This book allows me to fully understand what he stands by and I respect him even more now. I am glad and thankful for sharing his philosophy about politics, life, principles-centered living, etc. This is a valuable and inspiring book which I am sure that many people will find interesting and helpful at times of moral degradation and disconnectedness from one another 
 This book is a must read for pastors and all believers who desire to have a church centered around biblical, Christ exalted teaching.  Dr. Lawson brings the bible to life by expositing four passages that are centered around teaching the Word of God to convert sinners and strengthen believers.  Isn't it amazing how the Bible can speak for itself when it is interpreted through expository preaching!?  If you are interested in learning the importance of teaching the full counsel of God and the Bible in it's entirety, and not just the popular teachings that tickle the flesh; this book is exactly what you've been looking for 
 i've been falling asleep to this disc for more than 10 years - can't sleep w/o it -- i've gotten my husband hooked as well, and just bought another to bring with me when i'm on the road!   often, when nature sounds are coupled with music, they become obscured by the instrumentation playing along with it.  also, i have found it hard to fall asleep to this 'nature music,' as with repetitive play, i begin to memorize the melodies and become distracted by them. this cd is the perfect remedy -- just bare nature, ideal white noise.    
       Lee gives a six star performance by improving on what was already a five star performance in the third edition before Kerlinger's death.This is a must have book for anyone planning to do statistical analysis ,not only in psychology,but in the social sciences as well(especially economics).For example,Lee points out(pp.265,863)the importance of doing some type of test for goodness of fit(Chi- Square test,etc.)BEFORE a researcher assumes that he can make use of the normal probability distribution as an approximation of the data set at hand.This has not been  the case in econometric time series studies of (a) financial markets(financial economics,portfolio analysis)or of(b) real,durable investment over the business cycle.The Black-Scholes equation and the CAPM model,both used as foundations in business finance courses in all countries worldwide, just assumes normality.The famous Keynes-Tinbergen debate about the logical foundations of econometrics in the Economic Journal of 1939-40 reveals that the founders of econometrics did not test the data correctly for normality.Keynes's comments about the necessity to demonstrate the uniformity,homogeneity,and stability of the time series data before any multiple regressions were run was ridiculed as the foolish ,out of date utterances of a once magnificient mind that had deteriorated by the late 1930's.Benoit Mandelbrot's massive data analysis,replicated by many different researchers in many different countries since the early 1970's,shows that the assumption of normality ,underlying statistical price data analysis done by economists in practically all financial markets(stocks,bonds,money,currency,exchange,commodities)over the last 60 years,is all wrong.There is one minor oversite in the fourth edition.There is no discussion of Ellsberg's paradox and/or ambiguous probabilities.Lee does ,of course, discuss Keynes's concept of the weight of the evidence and probabilities that have low weight.Both Lee and Brady had agreed 15 years ago that Keynes's w,defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,was practically the same as Ellsberg's rho,defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1.In real life,most of the probabilities will turn out to be ambiguous(plus being underweighted).In such situations it will not be possible to treat probability according to the Kolmogorov axioms.The experimental-empirical work of Tversky-Kahneman demonstrates that the vast majority of real world decision makers are rational(contrary to the conclusion drawn from the evidence by Tversky-Kahneman)but are working with ambiguous or underweighted probabilities 
 I thought I wasn't going to like it, because my daughter went to go see it, and she said it was corny, NOT! I saw it and I absolutely loved it, although it didn't have Ernest, Shelly and the other cast from the first one, but it was definitely a winner.. Hats off to the remak 
 Based on the actual events that took place in 1985, The FBI Murders chronicles the events leading up to the largest FBI casualties ever suffered at one time in the history of the agency. Two well trained ex Green Beret buddies (played by David Soul & Michael Gross) team up and start robbing armored cars in Florida. Eventually they raise the stakes and start killing people during these robberies. The FBI tails these two and while attempting to arrest both men, one of the worst shoot-outs in law enforcement history ensues. When it's all over, several FBI agents are dead, there are several agents wounded and both suspects are shot and killed. This movie is made-for-tv, but it is still one of the hardest, most intense I've seen on network television. The ruthlesness and violence of these men is not toned down at all as in one scene, David Soul literally walks around looking for the surviving/wounded FBI agents and begins executing them on the ground. Highly recommended for fans of true stories or crime 
 Ernie Paniccioli has given Hip-Hop fans a treasure of photographs of nearly everyone who has been involved with Hip-Hop. His collections feature Old School Stars such as Grandmaster Flash and goes up to current stars such as Mystikal, Nelly, Nas , JayZ ,Common, and Talib Kweli. It will bring back memories of how some stars looked back in the dayz (Mary J. Blige in her classic ghetto fabulous style of jeans, boots and baseball cap). In addition, it will give a glimpse back in time at forgotten groups and rappers(Ultramagnetic MCs, KidnPlay, Jungle Brothers, Roxanne Shante etc.) The only slight I have with this book is that it did not have a picture of my old schoolmate DJ Scott La Rock (You will see KRS-One in a picture over a mural featuring Scott's name). A must buy for all Hip-Hop fans 
 Raymond Chandler certainly has a flair for terse dialogue and hardboiled metaphor, as well as knack for quick-sketching believable characters. But the active Philip Marlowe is the presence in THE LADY IN THE LAKE that kept this reader on the case. Reason: For me, narrators who seize the initiative are better in mysteries than narrators who are saved by dumb luck or the deus ex machina of improbable intervention.  But let's be honest. Hasn't Chandler been surpassed by others writing in this genre? I read very few mysteries--only three in the last three years according to my Amazon.com reviews. But two of these mysteries show Chandler's limits. For example, NIGHT TRAIN (Amis) certainly surpassed this book in sparkling dialogue and metaphor. And, TELL NO ONE (Coben) has characters that are just as well drawn while its plot (admittedly farfetched) is just as surprising but never hard to follow.   What THE LADY IN THE LAKE says to me is that an above average author can write to make a dollar and still do good work. I suppose the key is to work within a genre. Then, the genre keeps a middling author from overreaching, while making him mind his Ps and Qs. Such discipline enables a modest talent, like Chandler, to produce something beloved and lasting.   
 I personally thought the book was a great read. I just started reading Zane's books about 2 months ago and I have to say that she is a great author.  This was one of the best books I have ever read.  I had all my emotions come out in this book. The only thing is I wish it had a happier ending, but overall I would recommend this book to anyone 
 I just recently got done doing a run of "Women and Wallace" as Wallace, and it was one of the most amazing shows I have ever done in my life.  I can't believe how much this show got under my skin and is, now, forever embedded deep in my soul.  Not a day goes by when I don't think about how this role changed my life and not only strengthened me as a performer, but most of all, strengthened the relationship I have with my parents.  Johnathan Marc Sherman has this uncanny knack at bringing out the deepest emotions in every actor that touches his work, just by the way he writes.  This is an absolutely amazing play and I reccommend it to everyone who wants to find out something new about themselves.  Thank you Mr. Sherman for this amazing piece of theater 
 i got this as a gift and it is really good. my 2 months baby loves this . during first month she didnt show interest and look little frightened, but once i sat with her and slowly introduced , then she started loving this , now iam putting her atleast for an hour everyday,she is listening to the music and sound and trying to touch the fishes.   but when she moves her hands and  legs so fastly the strong plastic materials, and so i cant leave her alone in this and also i removed the toys which are in sides  but overall this product is good and attracts her concentration , she happily smiles and coos in this. she also make sounds with the music. 
 This book is easy to understand.  It gives a view of what happened at a critical time with a new technology. (1980 - 1990) It has a timeline and explains all those acronyms you hear but never knew what they were.  Here a man was clearly building an empire and it was not simple or easy.  You can see how just a small thing affected all our lives.  It continues today 
 We ordered this book as a reading for our 'Old Curmudgeons Book Club'. The book club is made up of a small bunch of 'older guys', i.e. in their 50s and 60s. We get together once a month and disucss non-fiction books. We've been doing this for about 15 years now. The book has to have something important to say about the human condition. Since nations and nationalism play such an important role in the 20th and 21st centuries, we thought it important to get a better handle on this.  Hobsbawm's book helps us to understand the incredibly short time that nations and nationalisms have played a big role in the human experience.  It is essentially a 19th century invention and yet it has become such a part of our thinking - e.g. the notion of the inviolability of national sovereignty, the whole business of being an 'American', Briton, Australian, etc. which is such an important part of self identity.  One piece of information I found to be astonishing is the statement that at the time of the founding of modern 'Italy',in the mid 19th century, only 2.5% of the population in the territory now known as Italy spoke Italian.  Hobsbawm's book then, helps to put into perspective the whole notion of nation and nationalism and helps us to be a bit more critical and more sceptical (suspicious perhaps) when political leaders appeal in language such as 'My fellow Americans', or 'Canadians believe that...', etc. Oh yeah? (What's America? What's Canada, etc.?  It helps us to recall Samuel Johnson's famous and useful phrase 'Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel'.  Of course, we can get into debates about the difference between 'nationalism' and 'patriotism' but, for my money, they're pretty much the same thing and both are based on unexamined assumptions.  Hobsbawm's book will get you thinking about these issues. Jim War 
 In the 8th book in the Scumble River mystery series, Skye Denison, has inherited a large home in desperate need of a makeover.  She hires Beau Hamilton, a good looking "bad boy" type based on good looks, excellent recommendations, and evidence of his handiwork around town.  Right from the beginning, however, Skye questions her choice of contractor when the work progresses slowly and with large errors.  After giving Beau adequate time to fix his lax work ethic and sloppy carpentry, Skye finally decides to fire him and find a new contractor to remodel her home.  Coming home late one evening, she hears what she believes is moaning and investigates.  Thinking it could be her missing cat, Bingo, Skye roams around in the woods only to discover the badly injured and bleeding Beau in a boat.  After diving into the chilly water and struggling to pull the boat to safety, Skye arrives back at the shoreline to discover her relatives and the authorities have arrived on the scene.  Her old nemesis, Sheriff Peterson is there to accuse her of murdering Beau over shoddy workmanship, and her new love interest, Chief Wally Boyd, steps in to defend her.  Working to clear her name and find a killer determined to make mischief in her new home, Skye must also decide whether to give old flame, Simon, a second chance, or to move ahead in a new relationship with Wally.   This is a fun, interesting series!  I adored the last two installments, and cannot wait for the next book!  The only issue that I have with the premise is the fact that the ending of the relationship between Skye and Simon seems to be a bit juvenile (which is the case in many relationships).  While reading the book, I just wanted to scream at them to discuss the "other woman" episode, and for them both to stop being so stubborn.  I personally don't believe that trust means never having to explain yourself.  If Simon had nothing to hide, then why was he so reluctant to talk about it?  In any case, this added to the suspense and the drama of the book, and I am hoping to see a resolution in the next installment.  However, I vote for Skye to pick Wally...Simon seems too straight-laced and boring for the fun-loving Skye.  I am really looking forward to seeing which man Skye will choose...  The first book in the series is called "Murder of a Small-Town Honey".  Enjoy!  
 Carmindy, from "What Not to Wear", goes details for creating your own five minute face, but the book goes far beyond that.  She breaks down makeup application by skin colors, age, and special events.  She gives product suggestions so you can find the exact makeup and color she uses based on hair color or age.  She even gives the brand name for both an expensive and inexpensive spray foundation.  I enjoyed reading the book as an addition to the show, which often only devotes a few minutes to makeup.  This expands what she does in the show and is well worth buying.  I really enjoyed reading it.  This is practical approach to applying makeup. I'm glad I purchased it. 
 I can't tell you how much money and personal emotion I've wasted on the new high protein and low sugar diet books that everyone is buying now. These scam books all enabled me to drop about 10 pounds, but then I'd gain  it all back and end up depressed and miserable. Thank God for 1001 Simple  Ways to Lose Weight! It is slower going at the start, but after a few weeks  you really do start to lose lots of weight. You pick and chose strategies  that you like and then you slowly make them part of your daily routine and  it's the ONLY thing that really does work! I lost over 90 pounds and have  kept it off for a year now. I can't tell you how happy and healthy and  energetic I now feel. If you're truly serious about losing your weight  forever, then look no further than this awesome book 
 Barry Hughart's Bridge of Birds is a beautiful fantasy of ancient China, a wonderfully complex and satisfying tale of a peasant village whose children are struck by a mysterious plague. Number Ten Ox undertakes a mission for his village to find a wiseman to save the children and finds Li Kao, a scholar with a "slight flaw in his character." Together they quest for a cure but discover a greater design behind the mission that turns into a battle between immortals over the missing Princess of Birds.  Ox and Li encounter an invisible giant hand, an immortal and evil emperor, a labyrinth of death (several in fact), ghosts, ingenious scams, and people who are far, far more than what they appear.  I love the story for many reasons. The story is wonderfully complex, but everything is so neatly tied up at the end, everything makes sense. There are moments where you will find yourself laughing and other scenes of such poignancy you will wipe a tear from your eye. And of course, it is all wrapped up in the wonderful land of ancient China where magic and the marvelous have always walked hand-in-hand.  I strongly recommend Bridge of Birds. 
 Mr. Mettee's book is practical, concise, readable, and attractive. My success will depend on how thoroughly I combine the advice contained in these pages with fingers-on-the-keyboard persistence. 
 I am a diehard AITF fan since it first aired so I don't care about extras or digital remasterings.  What is being shown on the DVD includes the footage that hasn't been aired in thirty years because it was trimmed out so they could show more commercials in syndicated reruns.  This series was a seminal piece of television history. In the current political climate of hypersensitivity and political correctness a series like this could never be produced and it is a sad commentary on how low American culture has declined.  I don't know what is holding up the DVD releases but I would snap up the entire series plus ABP in a boxed set in a second and I wish that is how they would just release this series 
 BUT, if you take anything out of this book, it's the fact that Jordan works harder than his peers, whether it was basketball or business.  His inner drive and desire to succeed and give it his all is what I took away from the book.  I would skim the parts on shoe design and focus mainly on his words and advice, especially on work ethic.    Note:  I finished the book in 1 1/2 hrs in the bookstore 
 I chose to read this book not because of 9-11, which I didn't find to be a central topic at all, nor any stance of mine regarding the preservation of wildlife habitat.  What interested me was a review I had read somewhere which described the Capgras syndrome Mark Schluter suffers from after his auto accident.  Having a son with an autism spectrum disorder which apparently causes him to feel/process emotions differently from "normal" people, I was intrigued with the idea of somebody failing to recognize a person merely because their mind lost its ability to make a connection to some stored emotional memory. (due to a physical injury to the brain)  This leaves us at the old thought that the entire world really is just sitting on our shoulders and so our perception can't be real; it's just a kind of delicate, shaky rough draft of the real world which depends way too much on some delicate wiring and isn't at all immune to modification and interpretation.  Our mind will happily fill in gaps and actually lie to us in order to keep us happy or at least feeling "normal."  I finished the book and remained pleased with the entire novel.  I thought of the habitat conservation topic as a good backdrop to further discuss the human mind and its place in the ecology so I was not disappointed that the author didn't focus more on the conservation of the cranes' habitat, as interesting as that actually was.  I wonder whether or not Barbara decides to help with the refuge and what happens with Weber and his family but I didn't think the book needed to tell us the details there.  Had I bothered to take notes while reading this book, I would have quite an interesting list of thoughts which jumped through my head at one point or another.  I definitely recommend the book especially if you have an interest in the human mind and how it maps/stores/processes the data it gathers from our environment.  This is the first book I've read from Powers although I've been wanting to read the Gold Bug Variations for a while now.  I'll certainly be reading it in the near future now 
 Some great songs, delivered in a low-key but satisfying and convincing way.  Enjoyable right away, but grows on you with repeated listening 
 This is a great snack to carry around for those in-between-meal blood-sugar crashes. Also a great healthy alternative to candy bars...the natural dates will satisfy any sweet tooth. It only has a few natural raw ingredients and tastes pretty good too. No preservatives or refined products 
 WWI !!! .... The war to end all wars!!  David Lloyd George (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - Chancellor of the Exchequer), Georges Clemenceau (France's President of the Council and Minister of war - doctor and journalist) and Vittorio Emanuele Orlando (Prime Minister of Italy - Professor of Law)   Lloyd George also found in WWI England's outlet to avoid in house rebellion against possible autonomy for Ireland.  During that period schism ruled the country threatening to expand to the rest of the British Empire.  LG talked `about the gravest issue raised in this country since the days of the Stuarts', the words `civil war' and `rebellion' was mentioned to describe the grave situation in Ireland. As Exchequer LG was afraid that post war period would breakdown the whole credit system with London, as world power, at its centre. A wave of financial panic that had started in New York engulfed the main Capitals all over Europe. At Versailles, Lloyd George had good ear for melodrama, and at 56 by 1919 he looked years older.  Orlando headed the Cabinet after humiliating defeat of Italy's armed forces at Caporetto (Slovenia) on the Austro-Italian front when Austro-Hungarian troops supported (of course) by German units, routed the Italian army and immediately broke the entire Italian front. The word `Caperetto' gained its defeating resonance in the Italian parlance. (Even Mussolini used it later to describe - and dismiss - any sense of defeatism in the Army - or anywhere within his administration) Orlando rebelled furiously at such `stigma' and at Versailles demanded (begged) to know if Italy were to be treated as `subordinate' - a point that caused lots of frictions within Italy - or enjoy the spoils of war with proper amenities. Acting as Catholic chaplain he relied on the Holy See to convey the gratifying news that Italy, although vanquished and tired to the bones, deserved just and fair treatment. His paroxysm of passion burst him into tears many times. At Versailles, Vittorio Orlando was 59 and came to the meeting overwrought, pale cheeked and white faced; he too looked years older.   Doctor Georges Clemenceau - the Tiger of France - was deluged several times before the WWI broke that Germany was premobilizing its forces at times France was utterly unprepared. (Some French troops were carried to their HQ by taxis) GC was also obsessed by the civil strife that engulfed Paris in 1914 - when many foreigners suspected of being German spies were arrested and troops came in to control the situation - The events developed violent temper in GC, on several occasions he was heard uttering words like `an idiot ...' `fire the guy...' `He should be torn to ribbons....'. At the terrible cost of draining French manpower, CG knew well that was an error that would never be repaired. The culprits were the Germans. The wrongdoers were the Germans; the greed came from Germany, expansionism was Germanic. To put an end to this deadlock, Germany ought to be penalized.  At Versailles, George Clemenceau was 79 by 1919 he acted much younger than his age.  The three didn't listen to Woodrow Wilson 14 points; a formidable man of principles, Wilson puritanically attached to neutrality, criticized the Treaty of Versailles that they drafted based on `Revenge. Hate. Fear. Desperation'  It is strange how the three musketeers couldn't perceive how war stifles reforms - greatness at the world stage had been their aim.   
 Although the story was somewhat predictable, it was a heartwarming account that left me feeling lost for the characters when I finished.  I enjoyed this quick read 
 This encyclopedia is a powerful resource for everyone. It's my first stop for treating a condition. With all of the harmful side effects of drugs and the state of health care in America, it's nice to know that someone like Dr. Null has taken the time to research and gather all of this information in one - easy to use -place. It makes a great present for anyone you love and care for 
 A Quantum Leap of reading.  How his man managed to take old pictures and form a believable, and personal, story around each one is an amazing feat.  I found myself wondering if he did travel back in time - was it possible - could I do it?  I even tried the self-hypnosis he told about - picking the civil war as my target.  No -- didn't work for me - yet!  Would I love to do it!  The ending of this book shook me - he turned a time travel into a mystery and then the last pages shake you around the other way.  It's amazing.  Read "The Mirror" , read Diana Gabaldon's time travel series -- but please don't miss including this book as your number one, best dog eared copy of your library.  You won't be sorry 
 The people who are knocking the Boondocks for being racist seem to ignore that McGruder is often just as harsh about the failures of the African-American community as he is of white people.  I find the comic to be a fairly intelligent examination of the issues of race in America that just happens to be funny.  In particular, I like that fact that McGruder is willing to risk offending people of all races.  He is merely pointing out the situations that exist in our world, calling attention to them by making us laugh at them.  Furthermore, Huey and Riley are characters; therefore, they need to have their own views on issues.  If these views sometimes seem harsh to whites (or people of any other race), the reader still needs to remember that they are only two characters.  There are other characters who offer different viewpoints from time to time.  This in my mind is very different from the kind of material that many conservatives like Rush spew that is constantly being pushed on the audience as "the truth."  Boondocks doesn't claim to be anything more than a politically aware cartoon.  How is that the same as Rush spreading opinions as "the truth" or Mancow telling us that "we will have to extriminate all Muslims who oppose Israel."  The Boondocks is funny, smart, and politically aware, but it doesn't claim to be more than entertainment.   
 I have just watched a lengthy Book TV interview with Susan Faludi on  C-Span. It was astonishing.  I give the book 5 stars (have not read it) to invite Susan and the sisterhood to read my review.   She was seamlessly "catty" and snide throughout--the very stereotype of the unhappy upper-class matrons I recall from my youth. She tagged almost every comment she made with a world-weary rush of fake snickers to, one gathers, prompt the uninitiated to understand the inside humor.   Her comments were peppered with smarmy jabs and snipings at enemies both cultural and personal as if to invite the viewer in to a private world of victimhood in which the sufferers were all women and all hip to their  situation yet, after all, powerless to grapple with their actual tormentors.  She needs some coaching.  
 You won't be dissappointed if you buy this book. It covered many (if not all) areas of life! Leslie is so motivating and inspiring! I could not put this book down! I read the whole book within 2 days! I have been going by this book this past week and have already lost 2.6 pounds! This is the best book anyone could ever buy! I can't wait for the next book she has coming out next January! 
 This is a fabulous product.  I use the whole Mustela line.  This is great for sponge bathing when your newborn arrives home.  I also use it on a cotton ball after baths to make sure my baby is extra clean.  This is great for helping babies complexion 
 This cd is hillarious!! Lewis is my all-time favorite comedian even before I got this cd!! This hillariously funny cd moved Lewis up a notch in my book. I cannot believe the bad reveiws just because of language, I find that ridiculous, considering this is one of the best comedy albums ever! 
 For my book I read the Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. I thouhgt it was a very intersting book. In thr begning they moved to this professor house because of the war. He lived on the country side so it was safer there. Lucy the youngest one found a wardrobe. There was something unusual found in the back of the wardrobe. It was another world called Narnia. Lucy made some friends and so did her symbolings. One of there frinds got in trouble. Could the save him befor the white which turned hin into stone?  I thought the book i read was fantastic. All of the characters fit perfectly for the part. There was a evil which. Also a lion who saves the day sometimes. This book will help you keep your interst. This book relates yo Watership Down. If you would compare them i would give both of then a ten 
 My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a great movie! My mother loved it when we saw it in theaters, and I got it for her for Christmas and she still loves it. Great movie 
 This is the ultimate book for any experienced C++ programmer who is new to the field of multi-threaded application development. If you are the kind of guy who learns by writing or reading lines of code then this book is not for you but if you want a solid foundation to build future multi threaded applications then look no further. The authors take you through all the concepts and the philosophies behind robust multi-threaded application development. I wish the authors had not included any APIs from any specific platforms. The building blocks and the techniques are all that are needed and you get them in abundance in this book. That would have reduced the price of the book. All the same money well spent 
 Spooky, emotional, sometimes funny stuff. "Your Amazing Life" is gorgeous, and "Astronaut" should be on the radio. This is a fine album that should be heard 
 oh, it is still lovely, but the first one is soooooooooooo much better to me.  i agree with one of the reviewers about doing too much.......way to much.  however, it is still an enjoyable listen.  i love what he did with showbiz and a.g.'s FAT POCKETS on FATBACKS.  that blew me away and made me blow the dust off RUNAWAY SLAVE.  there are some welcoming listens on here, but i strongly recommend THE UNSEEN 
 A, E, I, O, U, SOME, TIMES, Y. FISHHEADS FISHEADS, ROLLY POLLY FISHHEADS. FISHHEADS FISHHEADS, EAT THEM, YUM.  If any of you out there remember these lyrics from two tunes put out in the 1980's, you probably also remember WHERE you heard them. These two songs,(which in my opinion are some of the most lame ever), were popular on MTV.  And if A E I O U Sometimes Y, and Fishheads can make it on MTV, surely to God, anybody's music can!!!!!!! 8 to 80, blind crippled or crazy, PUT IT OUT and see what happens! You never know till you try. Forgotten felon or soaring saint, anyone can put out music and it be listened too. And don't worry about what individuals say, listen to what the masses say!!!!!!! They are who count. So often so many people are discouraged from their work, their art, by so called "friends" who's full intention in telling you that your work stinks, is due to their jealous minds. And while true critic friends do exist, it is rare. In other words, don't base your sellibility(is that a word?) on what a few individuals (even yourself) think, but on what the masses think. Ever heard of the term "regional sales"? Some things sell better in other places than where they originate from. What you can't give away in some sections of the country, might abound in other areas. In other words, even "if" your critic were actually expressing what they thought was the truth by saying you stink, in other portions of the world, people might think it's the best thing they ever heard. But you'll never know until you try. Years ago, I, and my friends had a bedroom band( bedroom, because there was no garage attached to the house), and we were our own worst critics. We thought we stank, but we kept playing, at least until we were distracted by things (girls), then we quit playing together. It wasn't long until people of the neighborhood were coming up to us and asking why we had STOPPED playing!!! You never know until you put it out. And note this: I took a writing class in the early 90's under a well known author who told us that the average manuscript gets about 70 rejections before it's published. The same holds true for music. As for this book, It is published by the same fine folks who publish the Writer's Market, a company that has existed for many many years. It has an outstanding reputation for providing both aspiring and well known writers the most updated information on book and magazine publishers, and has the same reputation for music companies and the like. There's lots of practical information contained in these pages. There are music publishers as well as producers and record companies. Each has the name of the business, their address and/or website, and often lists email addresses and phone numbers. The information can help you find someone to at least look at your work. If the Songwriter's Market publishers, find out a company has a pattern of ripping people off(a rarity), they stop listing them in their guide. If you want, need, a publication that can be a stepping stone to stardom, order this fine publication today 
 This books stands apart in autobiographies. Unlike autobiographies written in vanity at the crest of success, this one is written as a melancholic meditation on life, at the crest of what Henry Adams thought was his failure. Adams always refers to himself in third person and in the humorous and abject epithets giving the autobiography the character of a novel or a biography.  Henry Adams, was a historian, journalist and political private secretary, with intrests as varied as physics, chemistry, geology, evolution, mathematics, politics, history, and diplomacy. He was the son of a diplomat, Charles Francis Adams. His grand-father was John Quincy Adams the 6th president of USA and great-grand father was John Adams, the 2nd president.  Despite being one of the greatest American historians, with a successful career in history, journalism and literature, Adams regarded himself as a failure because he was inconsequential in politics and society as compared to his forefathers and his education based on eighteenth century principles of the founding fathers of USA, imparted through his relatives, peers, school, socity and the Harvard College, was unsuitable to meet the challenges of the world he was to grow into - the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Adams believed that the law of acceleration of forces in history lead to a situation where a person trained for a certain level of complexity finds himself at the mercy of forces of a higher complexity as he grows up. This was his theory of history, intimately derived from his experience of life.  He felt that all education through parents, school, college, work or life can never in its entirety prepare a person for life, because the society around you changes at an accelerating pace while your education rooted in your parents values and the value of the soceity of your childhood becomes obsolete by the time you need to put it to use. So at each stage of life man always needs to begin his education anew.  The merit of this books goes beyond just and insight into education, life or failure. It also illuminates the time from 1838 to 1905. Adams was close to political, literary, artistic and scientific circles in Europe and America and travelled far and wide visiting England, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Egypt, Mexico and Cuba, some of these countries again and again.  The books is rich in literary style and historical, literary, scientific, cultural, economic and sociological insights as it analyzes self, peoples, times and cultures 
 It was a great time in the late history of big bands and Basie was enjoying his popularity.  It also had to be a high working with Sinatra.  This collection was recorded live and definately swings 
 The Epson PictureMate is easy to use and the colors are the best!!  Many options for editing the pictures before printing.  Would recommend it highly. 
 I finaly got this knife so I could figure out how they open :D. The knife is pretty good, especially for the price. It is a little hard to open, though that might be the same with any paratrooper dagger 
 I came across Linda's book after months of looking for a resource that integrated Eastern wellness and nutrition principles into the Western lifestyle realities. Linda's book was a blessing! One month after taking some of the suggestions in the book, I was finally able to get rid of a respiratory condition that my  Western-trained physicians had simply labeled hayfever and prescribed an allergy pill. The usefulness of Linda's book didn't end there, though. I find myself regularly consulting it as seasons change from damp to dry, hot to cold, etc. It's an excellent resource for anyone who likes to be aware of how their food and lifestyle choices affect moods and wellness. Highly recommended 
 Oprah has long been maligned in literary circles as a lightweight talkshow host who dishes up weepy, sentimental, "women's" novels.  Farr does a great job of poking holes in this stereotype of Oprah.  She shows Oprah's thoughtfulness and intelligence, and the service that she has done in getting Americans interested in reading.  She explains how a voice like Oprah's is needed in the literary world, which tends to be dominated by men. She outlines the historical context in which Oprah's bookclub operated -- how it was a continuation of the "mass book club" tradition from the turn-of-the-century.  This book is a quick read, but there is much in it that can be referred back to later.  I recommend this book for anyone who is in a book club, has worked at a library or bookstore, is an English major in college, or who simply loves to read 
 Hello everyone. I put Sieze the Night down about five minutes ago. The book is quite a good read for fans of the author, or of the first book, Fear Nothing. The characters are great, very easy to come to love.   The plot line is much better in the second book, elaborating on many aspects of the first installment. I found it hard to put down.  However, the ending left room for another book. I began my search for the elusive third Christopher Snow book and have found nothing conclusive. Please.if any of you fans know if there really is, or will be a third book, let me know. I have started a discussion below, I would very much appreciate any helpful information 
 A rare book.  Zelinsky tells the story of "Rumpelstiltskin", evoking a story most American children will know.  Especially impressive is his tiny details.  A good example of this is his spinning wheel.  Many illustrated Rumpelstiltskin stories show the spinning wheel as something that Rumpelstiltskin throws straw towards, causing golden coins appear.  In this edition the spinning wheel is technically correct.  The miller's daughter is given empty bobbins, onto which Rumpelstiltskin spins golden threads.  Zelinsky's accomplished paintings show the golden bobbins gleaming, one on top of another. The portrayal of Rumpelstiltskin himself was described in one review I read as "Rackhamesque".  I don't know if this was the illustrator's intent, but he certain does seem culled from a classic European fairy tale book from the early twentieth (or even nineteenth) century.  The oil paintings look Southern European, and though a story with an odd moral (if you can outwit your opponent by cheating, you're in the clear) it is an excellent book for children.  Like its companion book, "Rapunzel", this too would be a promising book for storytelling 
 this album not only celebrates the art of turntablism but also black music in a positive light. They perform beat juggling and lots of unexpected delights. Check out Musica Negra which is one of their highlights and you will see what I mean. Of course, one looks forward to their next album and hope that they produce a solid album with unique beats as before.. 
 One of the previous reviewers asked "how many people have actually sat down and tried to read this stuff?"--I have, and millions of others.  I despise ADD wannabe literature experts.  Have you ever read "Howl"?!  Each word is musical and sparks with the electric elegaic style Ginsberg has perfected.  I frequently explore this book and never put it down disappointed.  It is true that some poems are better than others, but you'll have that in any great poet's repertoire.  Get this book.  You will not be disappointed 
 American Reformers is a wonderful resource book.  Walters has done a beautiful job blending information with anecdotes.  A great book for anyone interested in reform movements of the 19th Century, and their infuence on contemporary society 
 I never understood the title of this album. A spleen is an internal organ no matter how much poetry you read. Nevertheless...: This album from way back in 1985 was a big underground hit in England at the time which I'm sure was a big help for them. A credit to British forsight and taste if not humility. Usually this is thought of as a transitional album for them as while they still had some post-punk..or...um...goth?..elements going on with the bass guitar and the doom doom dish dish dish drum machine (they would use drum machines latter but the "world" sense would be dominate)..drum amchines DO have soul by the way, esp. here. This release also streched foward...and more so than I thought when I first heard this back in '89 or so. I just got this again in 2006 and it has been a lot of fun to rediscover. The group here are stretching further forward than I thought atb the time with the big timpanai drums and the trombones.  I turns out to be a very fun listen and the dramatic intensity of the first two tunes shows that this group had an extra level of talent and was destined for great things.  This album has a foggy, mukery and sombre quality. It takes alot of listenings for me to pick out the lyrics. It almost gives me a headache..bu the kind of headache one might get if a spirit was entering ones' body which I think might even be happening here. This group is THAT amazing. That said..I listened to this album 9 times in a row yesterday as if I was starving for some aspect of it. I expected this to be a pretty-cool transitional album bya great band..but it is kind of an underrated masterpiece. It's just that on the next record they would really explode... 
 I am a child of an alcoholic Mother.  I try very hard to avoid books that talk about adult children of Alcoholics becuase they usually make things sound very over technical and impersonal.  I am not a very emotional person and I know the decisions I make in my life are because of my families alcoholic issues.  However, this was a book that was not very hard to read and I would highly recoomend it.  After reading the very first story and bawling my eyes out about that little family princess who never understood and was always trying to make it okay,  I knew the book was for me to read.  That's ME!!! That's ME!!! I kept saying over and over. Ironically I highlighted every sentence and passage that had to do with my childhood and feelings in the book and I believe I ended up with 90% of it highlighted.  I couldn't help to think that someone had a hidden journal on my heart and feelings growing up.  If only that person had stepped in when I was young what a difference it would have made.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!! 
 there is none that doeth good."  Jorge Luis Borges is thought by many to be the 20th century's greatest Spanish-language writer.  Borges was a poet, essayist and short story writer. Although born in Argentina in 1899, Borges spent most of his early years in Europe until his family returned to Buenos Aires in 1921. "A Universal History of Iniquity", originally published as "A Universal History of Infamy" was published in 1935. The stories represent a collection of stories originally published in the Argentine newspaper Critica between 1933 and 1934.  The stories were a huge success for the newspaper and established Borges as a writer of the first rank in Argentina.  Each of the stories in Universal History of Iniquity was designed by Borges to give his newspaper readers a small glimpse of the evil that men (and sometimes women) do.  They vary from slave owning states in the pre-U.S. Civil War south in "The Cruel Redeemer Lazarus Morell", to the China Seas in "The Widow Ching - Pirate", to feudal Japan in "The Uncivil Teacher of Court Etiquette Kotsuke no Suke", Turkistan in "Hakim, the Masked Dyer of Merv" and the mean streets of Buenos Aires in "Man on Pink Corner".  Borges acknowledges that these stories were all loosely based on little known historical treatises, the Arabian Nights, and other pieces of fiction.  Lazarus Morell was clearly an homage to Mark Twain's Mississippi River stories.  Although this is Borges earliest work one can already see the creative, almost whimsical approach he takes to the art of telling a story.  He constantly throws the reader off balance and engages in little acts of mis-direction, perhaps starting a story by telling the reader he will not set out the facts behind a story and then proceed to do just that. In the Preface to the First Edition, Borges writes that certain techniques are "overly used: mismatched lists, abrupt transitions, the reduction of a person's life to two or three scenes."  While these are certainly valid self-criticisms the reader should remember, as Borges was no doubt aware, that these stories were written for publication in newspapers with severe word limitations.  I thought the condensed nature of the stories heightened their impact and think that perhaps Borges was engaging in yet another act of misdirection.      I came to this book after reading Danilo Kis' "A Tomb for Boris Davidovich". The structure and theme of Tomb for Boris Davidovich was intended by Kis to be part of a literary polemic between Kis and Borges, specifically concerning the title of Borge's Universal History of Iniquity. Kis seven stories all involved iniquities performed by those involved in the Stalinist purges of the 1930s, a horror that Kis felt made Borges' iniquities look quaint by comparison. Kis asserted that the universal infamies related by Borges were those of gangsters, pirates and highwaymen. Kis argues that as far as infamy was concerned, "infamy is when in the name of the idea of a better world for which whole generations have perished, in the name of a humanistic idea, you build camps and destroy both people and their most intimate drams of a better world." Now that I have read both books I think this may be something of an apple and oranges comparison.  Nevertheless, reading one book enhanced the experience I got from reading the other.  If the reader likes Borges' stories they might also enjoy Kis.  I think "A Universal History of Iniquity" is a wonderful entry point for anyone wishing to discover the work of a wonderful, compelling writer. 
 This book is the best thing for kids since peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were invented. It is illustrated, amusing, and fun to read even for adults. It's a complete short course in how to think, and how not to be fooled. Its advice applies to evaluating advertising, pseudoscientic claims, and what your teachers tell you. Hey, kids! Grownups can be wrong! Kids are encouraged not to accept everything they hear at face value; it is empowering to kids to know that they can use their own "baloney detectors." BUY IT! For your children, your grandchildren, to donate to the nearest school or library, or to read for yourself 
 When it comes to film adaptations, most films fail in some way.  To think that a Japanese film director could transform one of the greatest plays written in the English language and mke it his own, is quite tremendous. To think that he could use Japanese Noh theater images to enhance the adpatation is a stroke of genius.  Mifune is one of the greatest actors to play Macbeth, and dare say maybe the best.  Akira Kurosawa directed a masterpiece and proves why he is at the top of the pantheon of great world directors.   And, of course, The Criterion Collection folk out do themselves, again.  Thank goodness for them, because of it wasn't for them, we all would be missing out on great films.   
 Finally, at last, a book about the financial market that combines great advice with true wit and common sense. I've bought it for everyone I know. (Including my three year old son... A must for every Mom who'se thought about entering the market, but has never quite felt able to trust it before. With these chaps you're in safe, informative, entertaining hands. Alison Larki 
 An extremely entertaining and readable book. A pleasing eye for the small detail, an efficent prose style. He has extreme selective memory - the Spanish Civil War or Castro's Cuban revolution with no mention of crushing poverty just one example. In some cases he's flat out wrong - Cuba a 'rich country' under Batista. His dismisal of Ghandi smacks of racism. In general he has come to praise the colonialist English, Vichy France, Franco and Nixon; to savage FDR, JFK and labor unions.  Much of his savaging is Monday morning (or Wednesday afternoon) quarterbacking. He claims 'moral relativism' as the scourge of the twentieth century while turning a blind eye when events don't fit his 'white mans burden' theory of post-colonialism. He blaims Leninism for everything but earthquakes and is ruthless in his hatred of state communism, state capitalism. He swings numbers around to trash post-war labor enough to deserve Twain's over used saw: Lies, damned lies and statistics.  Blind of course to the morally relative shenanigans of Reagan and Thatcher, he doesn't come off as a revisionist so much as a self important old man settling old scores (take that, Roosevelt!) while remaining blissfully ignorant of the grey areas around his heros.  However, he can write and he knows his subject. With less axes to grind, this would be a great book. He's unrelenting in his hatred of the Bolsheviks and Nazis, and as I agree I find much of his real-politik analysis very interesting and in many cases accurate.  There are much better surveys of the 20th century, Martin Gilbert's comes to mind as his right wing spin doesn't kick in until 1968, but for the flavor of the times this is a tasty read. Just don't take his opinions, or even some of his 'facts', at face value 
 the greatest come backs of the year I like about every song on this one it had gotten a whole lot of replay from me hot music!!! 
 I currently have two of these KVM switches (one at home and one at work) for switching between a desktop running WinXP and my laptop (Fujitsu Lifebook T4210). It seems to work just fine, both using the keyboard hotkey (press scroll-lock twice) and the button on the KVM switch. My desktop computers are always on so no problems have come up with regards to power. My mice are the standard three button optical mice with the scroll wheel. There are only a few things I can complain about, 1. no extra USB port to serve as a printer hub (which is really only an  inconvenience if you don't have a network printer). 2. the effective footprint of the switch, with all the cables sticking out is close to 10 inches by 7 inches. They should have made it wall mountable so that it can be set aside more nicely. 
 "The Marines Of Autumn" by James Brady. St. Martin's Press, New York 2000.   On the very last page of this fiction book, the author, James Brady declares that the main character, Thomas Verity, was modeled after Brady's rifle company commander in the Taebeck Mountains of North Korea.  That commander was Captain John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, later U. S. Senator from Rhode Island, and Secretary of the Navy.  It seems to me that this novel is a character study, where the author, James Brady, presents a portrait of the ideal Marine infantry officer, with both good parts and bad parts.  Captain Thomas Verity is different, if not unique, as a Marine officer because he was born and raised in China, speaks Chinese, because he has seen combat (e.g. Guadalcanal) and then, because, after the War, he had gone to college.  As the Korean War begins, Verity is teaching at Georgetown University.   His ability to speak Chinese was the main reason that Captain Verity was recalled to active duty, as the Marines needed someone to monitor Chinese Communist radio traffic in China just across the border from North Korea.  Probably, the author has given this linguistic ability to his main character so that Captain Verity can be privy to the meetings of higher level officers who believe that the Chinese Army is coming.  This permits James Brady to make comments about the U.S. high command's pig headiness about the ability of the Chinese to invade Korea to support their Communistic allies.  It also allows Brady to zap General Douglas MacArthur who repeatedly denied the presence of the Chinese Army at the borders of North Korea or inside North Korea proper.  It is apparent that James Brady does not care for MacArthur, for, as an example in Chapter Two, (page 22) he has one person calling MacArthur, "The Mikado himself".    On a poignant note, the main character, Captain Verity, had lost his wife.  Now, with the death of Captain Verity, the young daughter, Kate, will be an orphan.  She asks, "And who will take me now to France to see the bridges".  
 I had seen this books literally dozens of times in the "Games" section of my local book store, yet had never given it a look, despite being a former (mediocre) college bowl contestant and (small-time) Jeopardy winner.  I assumed it was another boring autobiography from someone trying to capitalize on his newfound fame.  I got an email from a fellow trivia fan who told me to give it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The book is less about Ken Jennings and more about trivia as a whole. Jennings focuses on its history as well as its popularity in certain pockets of today's society.  Jennings takes an indepth look at an annual trivia contest which completely consumes Stevens Point, Wisconsin as well as the bar trivia scene, the quiz bowl circuit and much more.  Of course, Jennings also gives a look into his amazing streak on Jeopardy and an inside look at what goes on behind the scenes.    Even though Jennings peppers his text with facts and "trivia questions", one need not be a trivia fanatic to enjoy the book.  It's surprisingly well written, and even funny at times.  The history of trivia and an examination of how it pervades our culture is will interest most inquisitive readers.  
 I would like to thank reviewer Bruce Kendall for pointing out this book to me. This is a great book.  By the way, I have one reservation about this book: it has seven chapters, one on each of seven novels, and do not read a chapter on one of the seven novel until you have read the novel. He gives lots of details and it will ruin your reading experience. Just read one novel at a time and then read Nakobov's lecture notes on that particular novel. The only exception might be "Ulysses" where most readers need help and often use a reading guide. He gives a very detailed analysis of the plot and characters for all seven works, and for one book - "The Metamorphosis" - the comments are almost as long as the 55 page story.  It would be quite an experience if one could sit in on the classes of say Saul Bellow in Chicago in the 1930s and 40s when he taught literature. He recommended Flaubert, Dostoevsky, Lawrence, Joyce, and Dreiser, among others. Anyway, this is the next best thing. It is the course notes with an introduction by John Updike on the course taught by Nabokov at Cornell around 1950 or so.  He was born in Russia but learned English and French at an early age. His father was murdered in Russia, and was carrying a copy of Madame Bovary at the time of his death.  He went to university in England but then lived in Germany for 15 years, and then came to the Boston area where he taught at Wellesley College as just an Assistant Prof. teaching Russian 201, a survey of Russian literature. He worked simultaneously at Harvard for about 10 years, but not in literature. He then got a position as Associate Prof. of Slavic Literature at Cornell.  Nabokov's main love was literature, but since he was not in the English Department, he could not teach American literature, so he gave courses on European literature. This book outlines course material prepared by Nabokov for courses 311-312, Masters of European fiction.  If you read this book, it is similar to taking his course. His approach is to examine a small number of books and look at each great detail. There is lots of analysis plus some sample exam questions at the back of the book.  His seven books are:  Jane Austen - Mansfield Park Charles Dickens - Bleak House Gustave Flaubert - Madame Bovary Robert Louis Stevenson - Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Marcel Proust - The Walk by Swann's Place Franz Kafka - The Metamorphosis James Joyce - Ulysses  This is an excellent lecture series prepared by Nabokov with his handwritten notes and sketches.  There is a note from him that he had more fun looking at the literature than the students. He was working on Lolita as he taught, and actually threw out the manuscript. His wife convinced him to continue and publish, and he was able to retire with the income from that book 
 This book should serve as the freelance writer's dashboard guide to all that is writing. As a veteran journalist, and "backseat writer" this book is the only one I would recommend to all levels of freelance business writers.  It is a veritable feast at the table of not only how-to in writing but how-to succeed and be "well-fed."  Nettie Hartsock 
 Hank Snow found fame hard to come by, but when it came, it came in a big way, with the phenomenal success in 1950 of I'm moving on, a song that dominated the country charts and also made the American pop charts.  Following that success, Hank had many more hits on the country charts during the fifties and sixties including Golden rocket, I don't hurt anymore, I've been everywhere and Let me go lover, all of which made number one. He surprised everybody by returning to number one in the mid-seventies with Hello love, but was unable to capitalize on it and only had limited success thereafter.  Hank played a key role (with Colonel Parker) in establishing Elvis Presley's fledgling career before Colonel Parker took full control of it. Elvis remained a fan of Hank's music and had a major international pop hit with Fool such as I, a cover of one of Hank's country hits included here.   This compilation contains all of Hank's really important country hits though it would require a double-CD to include all his top ten country hits and more than that to provide an in-depth retrospective. Inevitably, fans will argue about some tracks they'd like to have seen included but this set will satisfy most people's needs.  It is worth noting that all these tracks are available on the Australian triple-CD, Legendary Hank Snow, which contains a further thirty of Hank's songs - however, the re-mastering and liner notes are superior on this single CD. You must decide what is most important to you 
 This book is humorous and written so that a newcomer like me can understand. I still look foolish out there on occassion, but...what the hell....it's fun 
 I just finished reading Jennifer Huntley's "Eight Days in Provence", and I must admit, pacing myself was actually my biggest challenge, I just did not want to reach the end. The details were exquisite, like the breathtaking landscapes, "Red poppies, iridescent and translucent in morning sun, slashed across the fields every now and then." The delectable and not so delectable cuisine,  "like black mud from the bottom of the salty sea." They were sprinkled throughout in all the right places. There were so many moments throughout the story when I felt as though I had been in those same situations, and I could really relate to the characters.  I loved the idea that although "Eight Days in Provence" was a true story, it had fairytale like, qualities that enabled me to be drawn into the experience. The point at which I truly appreciated Jennifer's writing was on the day that her travel group visited St.-Paul-de-Mausole, the asylum that Van Gogh had gone to recover; the place where he painted more than one hundred fifty paintings during that year. When "Jenny" stood at the window and "saw" what he saw, it was like reality seeing fantasy as reality. I fell in love with this book and wished for it to be "Years in Provence!"  I am an avid traveler and Jennifer brought to life again, the many James' I have encountered throughout my journeys. More importantly though, she helped me to see that they all have a place in my heart and will now, probably soon be characters in my books! Thank you for the inspiration and for sharing such an intimate encounter. It was delicious, as are most things French!  
 This book is sooooooooo good. i would defff. suggest ready it, because it is soooo awesome and soooo good, however, i am realllllly sad that the girls are there own ways now and growing apart. However, the end is good. I cried. It was sad. :( BOOHOO 
 I am a non-Christian and read this book after reading about Nouwen in Tim Madigan's book on Mr Rogers. Nouwen sounded like a man who lived his faith in a beautiful and attractive way, and I wanted to read the writing that so inspired Madigan and Mr Rogers.  As another reviewer pointed out, as a non-Christian I did get the distinct impression that Nouwen didn't think I was going to burn in hell, which is at odds with what I have read from every other Christian writer besides Philip Gulley and Anne Lamott. So if you are trying to convert someone, this is a loving and appealing book to give someone that will showcase the faith in a light that would attract a non-believer. However, don't be surprised if that nonbeliever feels led to live in a more attractive way but does not embrace Christ, since the book doesn't try to convince one in that direction.  Because of this, I found it a great read. I usually put books down if I feel they are pushing the conversion angle too hard, because I am not converting, I am just finding out how other people think and exploring different belief systems. This book gently nudges people towards feeling embraced by God and led to lead a life of service and care to others. There were many parts that moved me to tears. Nouwen has a quiet way of speaking and I found his religious philosophy and example inspiring and open enough to include me and other non-believers.  
 Set in 17th Century India, this sequel to The Twentieth Wife continues the story of Mehrunnisa, the beloved wife of the Emperor.  It tells the tale of her power and how she manages to actively participate in a man's world. She's very political as well as beautiful and it helps that her husband adores her.   This was a world where the Emperor and his court had everything.  Precious jewels decorated garments and furniture.  There were lavish gardens and fabulous food.  (They even ate sherbet made from ice that was carried down from the mountains.)  There were hundreds of women in the Emperor's harem, each one wanting to give him a son.  As only one son could become emperor, these young men competed with each other and also with their father.  Their lives were about combat, death or cruel punishment.   Mehrunnisa had no sons, only a daughter from a former marriage.  She therefore had to make choices as to who to support.  Mostly, she was smart and made wise choices.  But her political ambitions grew too large.  Eventually, things changed.   I enjoyed this sequel as I had enjoyed its predecessor.  It was really a pleasure to read about Mehrunnisa's life as a mature woman who thrived so well in a man's world.  Her husband counted on her for everything and she was really the power behind the throne.  Of course, as I read the book I was also completely turned off by the excesses.  These people at court led lives of splendor while the rest of their country starved.   Women could become part of the harem and lead a life of luxury.  But if a man wasn't born into the right family, there was no hope for him.  The wars were deadly.  As many as 2000 or more men would be killed in a single battle between competing brothers. And yet I was caught up in the story and the authentic historical details.     Later, Mehrunnisa's niece became the woman for whom the Taj Mahal was built and she was the one who will be remembered from that period of time.  But as this book clearly points out, the woman with the political clout was really Mehrunnisa.   The Feast of Roses is fine story well told.  I was swept up in it.  Read it for what it is and enjoy 
 I found the book full of refreshing information and advice that I can easily follow - and have.  I already do a lot of what the book suggests, but it helped me to be a bit more thoughtful about how I deal with emotions at work. As a bonus, I also find the strategies to be very helpful at home with my two children.  By chance, I read the first appendix which had some fun quizzes and ideas.  These should be part of the regular book since I almost missed out on the material.  The stories are quite interesting - the `good guy' doesn't always finish first - and that is what the book is about - doing the right thing, not becoming king of the hill. All in all, easy to read and extremely helpful to me. 
 This is about as good as it gets in terms of an overview of Armenian history. Armenia is an incredibly fascinating study in the context of the Middle East, and the world's history at large. Containing a series of  contributions on various topics by leading scholars in the field and edited  by one of the foremost scholars, Hovannisian, this is an outstanding read  and should be on any Armenian or history scholar's shelf 
 I very much enjoyed this book.  A very conversational style.  The parts about Billy the Kid (a small portion of the book) seem a little out of place and forced, because they are not first person accounts, like the rest of the book.  Those parts are interesting, just not as engaging as his first-person accounts.  I enjoyed that he tells the reader that his motivation in writing is to make a few bucks 
 This book is a great, fun to read biography on Diane France. It would be a very good book to read if you are intrested in science. It is very well written and it explains Diane France's life, her career, and what a forensic anthropologist is.     
 I was looking for activities related to black bears.  This book includes black bears, panda bears, grizzly bears, and many other bears.  The activities target grades 2 - 5 
 Wow what a great book to read to the two - five year old set that they can look back on at an older age with fond memories.  Cute story but the illustrations are what will keep kids looking through the book for years to come.  Sendak does a great job of creating "wild things" that are somehow a little bit monster like yet cuddly and loveable.  And of course our Max knows the magic trick of how to become king of them all. So let the wild rumpus start.  You'll still be home in time for a hot supper!  
 A thoroughly charming read.  Was sold on this one by Marcia Brown's "Strings Attached" story on the sneak preview.  She must have a colorful family indeed!  Also enjoyed the Mandela piece.  Great fun, even if you're not a gardener 
 The machine is very quiet and the construction is solid so it should last for many years.  I like the fact that it also tells you how many calories you burn -- the calory-burned count is more motivating than the number of steps taken 
 These books will change the way you pray!  While it took me a couple of chapters to really get into it, once I did there was no laying the book down.  I was able to "see" the powers of darkness that we, as Christians, fight with daily.  Yes, it's a fiction novel, but it is based on Scripture.  My whole prayer life changed, and has become more effective.  
 When I first bought this CD, I have to admit that I just bought it because I thought the cover artwork was kinda cool. I buy music on the spur of the moment am always kinda hoping that I can find the salvation of rock music. I think I found it. This CD is a awkwardly experimantal blend of rytham and feeling. The vocalist is very expressive and the guitar riffs are amazing. The bass player is audible (which doesn't happen too often any more) and there are guitar solos. Guitar solos! That's almost unheard of in metal anymore. (...) Anyways, the tracks progress in a very melodic method with a flow and purpose. They are as follows:   1. Do you Call My Name: the opening of the album rates a 4/5.   2. Rectifier: The second track calls for change and a 5/5.   3. Fallen Rock Zone: Weird and interesting lyrics. Good music   though, but the song still rates only a 2/5   4. Only: One of my favorites about losing control of yourself after a terrible end of a relationship and/or friendship. Gets an overall 5/5   5. On My Side: song about being alone with no one to care and no way out. Music and lyrics are both excellent and get another 5/5 for Ra.   6. Violater: this song is okay. Gets a 3/5   7. I Believe: Song about religous convictions and the way the world should be. Good song deserving a 4/5.   8. Parole: Violent song about bleeding your ex after you get out of prison. really messed up and only gets a 1/5.   9. High Sensitivity: an okay track. Gets a 3/5.  10. Skorn: A song about the pain you feel after someone you love leaves and didn't feel the way you thought they did. Also covers the anger felt in this situation. Excellent music and lyrics deserving a 5/5.  11. Walking and Thinking: This song is pretty much a spacer between Skorn and the last track. Isn't the best but still gets a 3/5.  12. Sky: This is it. The one that stands out above the rest. The song of the album. This one is my personal favorite. It is musically amazing. It is lyrically moving. The vocal sound is very painfully amazing. If possible I would give this song a 10/5 but I can only give it a 5/5.  There's my report on Ra's From One. If you like it then you're gonna be really disappointed with their second album Duality. But anyway, this one is amazing. Pick it up and at least try it out. If you don't like it send it to me because one of my friends scraped (not scratched, but scraped) the CD and it doesn't play the good songs at the end anymore. Anyways, these guys are also good live so go see them. I want to know if this review helped you at all. See ya. 
 I read Love, Stars, and All That for a class at the University of Virginia.  The entire class seemed to really enjoy this book.  I absolutely adored it.  It is warm, funny, realistic, and not only intellectually stimulating, but emotionally fulfilling as well.  It is about a girl named Gita who leaves India to attend college at Berkely.  However, you don't have to be from India, or female to enjoy this book.  I feel this book transcends any specific gender or nationality, and finds a common thread to relate to everyone.  The characters are very realistic, and the plot moves with ease.  It is such an intimate reading experience.  You will find yourself laughing, and at the end, you will have found you have learned as well 
 Bogle, Bob Brinker, and Jane Bryant Quinn sold me on the idea of index funds. There are some who believe you need to stick to actively managed funds to, as one money manager told me, "be there to steer the plane away from the mountain at the last minute." Hogwash, especially when you consider a lot of blend funds have 95 percent the same allocations as comparable index funds, only you pay the higher expense ratios.  I've done very well with index funds covering the S&P 500, as well as the European and Pacific markets. I'm just now breaking into the index fund's conceptual spawn, the ETF.  One complaint: the book is indeed repetitive. The major selling points (e.g., expense ratios, tax efficiency, market allocations, etc.) could have been stated as well with half the text. It's also a somewhat tedious read, but still worthwhile. (I'm a CFP in training. 
 This is the best country in the world to live in. The problem with many people here is they are entirely oblivious of this fact. For people like me who come to America from the non-free parts of the world this is as obvious as it can be. For most Americans who have never fainted from hunger, been oppressed or abused, all of this is a big mystery. It's impossible to appreciate anything as long as it remains a given. They say ignorance is bliss. Well, not really. The end result can be deadly. The choice is yours.  Although I find Michael quite radical on certain points, the book does a terrific job exposing the modern American revolutionaries. People who are ignorant to understand what's going on in the country or those who are deliberately contributing to the collapse of America will all have their bitter remorse should the Socialist revolution succeed in the US. The problem is it'll be too late to she tears on that day. Wake up, America and save yourself while there is still a chance. What else can I say? 
 This is the bible of Wastewater Engineering.  I'm currently a student studying Civil/Environmental Engineering and every professor I've talked to in my department has recommended this book for any type of Wastewater Treatment Plant design.  If this book doesn't have the information you want (unlikely), the WEF MOP might 
 This mystery got off to a slow start by taking a few chapters to even delve into the murders. However, after the first crime, the book was up and running. I enjoyed it a lot, and I loved Abby. I really didn't know who the murderer was until the end, and it was such a shocker. The author threw in some pretty convincing red herrings. The motive was also a  suprise and very well done. I hope there is a sequel. 
 Set in the 1850s and based upon true events through the tiny community of Bethel Missouri and its people, A Clearing In The Wild by novelist Jane Kirkpatrick is the engaging story of Emma Wagner. As the young Emma becomes less and less restrained by social barriers in an evocative tale of a young woman standing up for her individualism against the social, cultural, and religiously based strictures imposed upon women of the era. Jane Kirkpatrick's epic novel is characterized by memorable characters embedded in an original and engaging plot that rivets the readers total attention from beginning to end. A Clearing In The Wild is a welcome acquisition for any community library, and will result in readers seeking out Jane Kirkpatrick's many previous novels including A Land Of Sheltered Promise (1578567335), and her three volume "Tender Ties" series from WaterBrook Press. 
 It's not only a good book to read for interviews, it is also a good book to review basic programming concepts, which you can easily forget.  I recommend this book and I wish there were similar books specifically for Java, C++, and C# 
 So far I have read Elijah, David, and Moses.  All three are excellent, but Elijah has been my favorite.  If you are a Christian looking for a way to have more of God and draw closer to Him.  Elijah will be of great benefit to you.  Elijah was a man with a great annointing on His life and was selfless and dedicated to obedience.  Charles Swindoll does show a balanced view of Elijah's weaknesses and strengths.  Swindoll has a way of getting into the skin of each person he is studying.  It was easy for me to relate to Elijah on a personal level because Charles Swindoll has a way of reflecting the human qualities of this giant for God along with the supernatural nature of God that lives within each of us.  I enjoyed reading this book slowly so as not to miss one drop.  : 
 My 8 year old boy read this and immediately asked for more like this!  He loved these books.  They take the kids into the Middle Ages with three fictional kids from our time.  Plus they fill it with fun facts from that time period.  A great book, for learning and for fun reading 
 My wife wanted this movie, and I was surprised to find it on DVD. Was I glad! If you've forgotten about how good movie musicals can be, give this one a try. With Rita Hayworth, Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers at the top of their form and with words and music by the Gershwins, this is about as good as it gets. Of the great female dancers in movie musicals, there is Rita Hayworth, Cyd Charisse, Leslie Caron and a few others. Trained as a dancer since childhood, Hayworth always was right up at the top of the list. This movie shows why. And of course, she's drop-dead gorgeous and a darn good comic actor. Gene Kelly's dance with his alter-ego in this movie may not be as famous as his Singin' in the Rain number, but it should be!  Try it. You'll like it 
 If you find yourself in a position where the individuals in authority over you are, in the actual state of affairs, your moral inferiors, then on this level alone you will be able to appreciate this book 
 Any collection that has The Lost Patrol has got to be worth the 40 bucks.  That movie and Boris Karloff alone is something to behold.  But this collection also contains Sgt Rutlidge which a movie way before its time.  Mary Queen of Scots, I wasn't even aware was a John Ford Movie. The Informer another great and Cheyene Autumn.  I think this set has a little bit of something for everyone. I just wish that we knew if this was the 66 minute watered down version of Lost Patrol or the original uncut version. 
 Good descriptive view of Korean War.  There were areas where I thought the research was a bit sloppy - wish some of the facts had been double checked by a good fact checker or what ever.  I enjoy Toland's work, have read most of it, and enjoyed this one but it was not one of his best works.  Recommend reading but reading with a mind set that not all is written in stone 
 It was a great movie.  If there were such a place as West World I would enjoy taking a vacation over there.  I know I would have a great time. I am sure that all of you who have seen the movie would want to go there also if it were real.  It was a movie worth buying 
 This is the book that puts it all together.  If you have used recruiters before, then this book is a must read.  It has such an amount of helpful information that it is very difficult to call out any one specific point.  If you aspire to be a CEO some day, or are striving towards the top rung of that corporate ladder, this book will help you get there.  You get to see the hiring process for the upper level executives.  And, it is really helpful and beneficial for anyone who has any degree of business experience.  I whole heartedly recommend it 
 I think many of the reviewers here express much better the pros of Plantinga than I could.  The only new thing I coud add is that Plantinga only offers a draw.  I think in the past a reviewer said this is not a 'theodicy', which is right.  My conclusion was that all he was saying is that it is not illogical to give the benefit of the doubt to God for allowing evil.  I especially enjoyed this book because my wife is taking a class in philosophy and we have talked about many terms about false argumentation.  Indeed those who accuse God for allowing evil certainly use false argumentation 
 I totally loved this book...i read it once  but i dont own it and id like to know where i can get it 
     During a time of conflict and upheavel, a wandering story teller is arrested by a perfidious bureaucrat for the crime of appearing suspicious and being in the wrong place at the wrong time (and possible violations of the Patriot Act). Imprisoned, Kai Lung does not languish. Although his enemy has the ear of the local mandarin, Kai Lung is aided by a beautiful woman who possesses the mandarin's other ear. In the tradition of "The Arabian Nights" our hero intrigues the mandarin's interest, spinning tales by turn ironic, poignant and pointed. With each tale told, the sympathy of the mandarin, the frustration of the bureaucrat and the love between Kai Lung and his ally grow accordingly and Kai Lung survives another day.   This story is set in the China of long ago and related through the filter of an early twentieth century english writer. The courtly, overly flowery language is deliciously funny and displays a sly satiricism which reminds me of "Gulliver's Travels". A truly timeless gem which may be read on different levels by different ages.   Will Kai Lung survive? Yes, but you really should see how...  
 This book is definitely the "Part 2" of a series that begoins with Didion's "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" and each time that i return to it I feel like I am sitting down with a dear friend that I haven't talked to in a while. Other reviewers seem to have covered the title piece quite well, but I am intrigued that nobody seems to have mentioned my favorite -"Holy Water"- a fascinating look behind the scenes at the California Water Authority. I assign this essay again and again to my environmentalist students, both for the immediate content and for the intriguing window into the seductive nature of technology -one feels that Didion comes to be horrified and walks away enthralled. You will be too 
 You will find a lot of delineations in this book: all aspects and sun-moon combinations are reviewed. But Lewi Grant goes further. He modifies his delineations according to other aspects that can be found in the natal chart. A venus-jupiter conjunction in your radix will differ if your chart has a venus-mars trine as well or a venus-mars conjunction. This is just not a textbook about two planets in aspect, but about different planets in aspect. That's the way delineations should be handled: all aspects are to be seen and interpreted as a chain. Only Lewi Grant seems to understand this... 
 Really a wonderful book - both beautiful to look at and informative.  Very interesting reading, as well as artistically lovely with wonderful, colorful photography.  I am not a decorator or designer by trade, but go to this type of book for creative inspiration, and this one was a winner.  
 When this album was released in 1987, U2 was already one of the world's most popular bands, even though their previous album, 1984's "The Unforgettable Fire", had been coolly received by fans and critics alike.  Their reputation remained high, though, with the tremendous "October" from 1982 and "War" from 1983 still fresh in fans' minds.  Nobody, however, really expected U2 to put it all together like this.  This album is sheer brilliance from top to bottom in every way.  Young music fans should consider this an absolute essential in starting a collection, because it's one of the few real classics that carry a sound that still stands fresh today.    What is truly amazing to me about this album is that there are so many songs that can stand completely on their own - "Where the Streets Have No Name", "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" and "With or Without You" were all major hits worldwide, and yet so many other songs - practically ALL of them - have become cover targets for other artists and have such striking individual relevance that it's hard to also believe how cohesively they fit together as an album.  "Bullet the Blue Sky" follows an early synopsis of international terrorism, "Running to Stand Still" follows the descent of a heroin addict, and the rest of the album follows topic after relevant topic with "Red Hill Mining Town", "Trip Through Your Wires", "One Tree Hill" and "Exit".    In many ways, I've compared this album as the opposite bookend to the Beatles "Sergeant Pepper", framing 20 years of amazing music from the other side of the Atlantic.  This is the greatest performance of all from the world's most significant musicians of the last 25 years 
 The Bad - Like all of the Portable MBA series, the book provides a limited and somewhat superficial coverage of the topic.  It will not replace a good entreprenuerial course in an excellent MBA program.  The Good - Having been involved in four failed and one successful entrepreneurial ventures in the past 15 years, I can tell you with a great deal of certainty that there are many hidden gems in the book that will save you (potentially) years of wasted efforts and large sums of money.  One example: if you are planning a business venture, and you cannot name specific companies, and specific individuals in specific companies, as part of your target market, then you have not performed due dilegence and are not ready to begin a business venture.  Vague target markets such as "the public" or "somebody and some large telecomm company" are the sure road to failure 
 There are just so many times when it comes to making a good hits package, they can be either good or bad, but the cases with the 20th Century Masters Millenium Collection has been either a considered hit or miss when it comes to showcasing a artist definitively. That has been the case with so many acts like Joe Cocker and Rod Stewart and classic Motown legends like Diana Ross and The Temptations. For The Commodores, the group hasn't been around in years, but there is always the possibility of finding a good hits package all theirs, following the R&B legends from Alabama.   The Commodores 20th Century Masters Millenuim Collection is a simple and convient reflection behind one of the most unique R&B groups of the 70's and 80's. The collection does a really good job at highlighting Lionel Richie and company. The songs here are arguably as simple and definitive as you could expect. The compilation includes some great party anthems like Brick House and Machine Gun, as well as classic ballads like their tribute to Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson on Nightshift, Sweet Love to even simple ballads like Three Times A Lady and Easy. While there are a lot of great tracks here, there are a couple of disadvantages to the record. One of them is that the album overhadows tracks like the Funk track Girl, I Think The World About You and Zoom. Not only that, but the tracks on the collection weren't remastered as well as well as other collections like the 1997 Ultimate Collection of The Commodores.  Despite a few flaws, The Commodores 20th Century Masters Millenium Collection is a very simple and straight forward reflection of one of the best 70's groups of all time. This is a very inexpensive, but mostly well-thought out reflection of Lionel Richie & Company. If you are on a budget and really want to get your groove on, I absolutely suggest this great album.  Album Cover: B+  Songs: B  Price: A-  Remastering: C+  Overall: B 1/2-  
 I first bought this on CD about five years ago.  I didn't like it; I was in the midst of an Art Blakey immersion and found this band's flexibility to be intimidating and unlistenable.  I gave it away to my trumpeter friend.  Five years later, I bought "E.S.P." which is the album prior to this one, and with the same personnel.  It blew my mind, so I went and bought almost everything this quintet ever recorded.  It has occurred to me that this album is the only one I have purchased twice.  It was worth it.  Miles, with Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams, recorded this album more or less straight down without ANY second complete takes.  The result is the closest thing possible to a live performance, and this almost live performance is one of absolute inspiration.  Miles recognized throughout his career that the essence of jazz is in the spontaneity, the way special things happen with the right musicians without warning.  That's why "Kind of Blue" had only one second take.  There are some rough, miscommunicated moments on this album (Miles never really was good at coming back in with the melody at the right time, but he didn't care and the band was flexible enough to recover) but the little failures are nothing compared to the great successes.  The highlights of this album are "Footprints," a classic, meter-shifting, angular blues performance, and "Gingerbread Boy," actually similar in description (it uses a blues form, albeit loosely) but totally different in feel.  "Orbits" and "Delores" are Wayne Shorter tunes with very intriguing melodies and harmonies, and "Freedom Jazz Dance" is funky in the most subtle way possible.  The highest masterpiece, though, is "Circle," a semi-ballad in 3/4 time.  Whether there was a composed melody is a little ambiguous, though if what Miles plays was improvised, it's such a compelling melody that one wouldn't know he was making it up on the spot.  Wayne's solo is very much the same way, completely free of cliche but absolutely beautiful, and Herbie's piano solo is a towering achievement of harmonic, rhythmic, and above all melodic interest.  Perfect.  Okay, so in listing the highlights, I ended up mentioning every tune.  This album is that strong, all the way through.  However, it's not a good place to start with Miles.  Unless you're listening super-carefully (and know what to listen for), most of the tunes seem somewhat formless.  Hancock doesn't play a lot of chords in accompaniment, so there's not much of a thread to hold on to, other than thematic improvisation relating to the melody.  Perhaps "Circle" is the exception; it's beautiful on all levels.  This album is a masterpiece, but it's difficult and somewhat inaccessible (though never sonically offensive).  Get "E.S.P." first; it's every bit as advanced but the harmony is a little more clear.  If you like it, then get this one 
 I am a psychologist myself, and ever since i first began studying psychology, I have been fascinated by the work of Dr. Seligman.  Once I started working as a therapist, I purchased and this book to facilitate my work with clients.  Dr. Seligman is a talented, amusing, and engaging writer who presents an extremely pursuasive review of his research into the effects of learned optimism on mood, performance, health, etc.  Because his research includes areas as diverse as including health (showing greater breast cancer survival rates for those who are more optimistic), sales success (proving that optimistic salesman are more successful), and sports/politics (providing evidence that both sports teams and political candidates are more likely to win when optimism is increased), his methods are beleivable to even the most die-hard psychological skeptic.  Dr. Seligman explains your attribution style--that is, how you explain your successes/failures--can have a major impact on mood as well as all of the other dimensions mentioned above.  He provides the reader with a concrete, easily understandible model to asses their own thinking style, emphasizing that being able to monitor your thoughts is the first step towards changing them.  Finally, he presents a simple plan for changing though patterns which involves easy to implement steps.  This book will definitely help you to better understand how your thought patterns affect your mood and how to go about making changes in order to live a happier, healthier life; highly recommended 
 Wow, I couldn't put the book down.  Another great testament to the grace of God and also His faithfulness.  Another must for reading and also the church library 
 I'm not sure what possessed me to buy this book. I'm certainly past 40 and not in the habit of buying 'self help' books regardless how well credentialed the author is! But buy it I did.  It was an eye opener. Once I started reading it, I was compelled to keep on going. There was just enough of those 'ah ha' moments to keep me interested. And enough of those moments when the world goes quiet and seems to take a pause and you know the author is talking just to you!  Having said that though, this book is not easy. If you want an easy, uplifting read that will stimulate to change your life, forget it! This book isn't about simply sitting down for a few hours and having a pleasant read. You have to 'get involved', take the tests, do the reflection. Be prepared to be scared!  I've got to admit, I didn't do all that stuff, so don't feel I got the most out of the book. I liked the way Barbara Sher admonished me through the course of the book to get with the program. But it didn't work, I just read it for the fun of it and will need to go back and do it properly.  If you are serious about evaluating your life now that you've hit 40 (or past 40 for that matter), go for it. Buy the book. Do the exercises and change your life. This book could well be the thing that's starts the journey. Good luck. 
 We like seeing foreign films (less violence, more human emotions) and this was a treat.  A Swedish researcher perches on a high platform taking notes about the kitchen habits of a Norwegian bachelor farmer.  Both live isolated lives and eventually break through the barriers of observer and observed to form a friendship.  Tenuous at first, the lonely men grow to be close friends.  This disturbs the farmer's friend and the researcher's boss.  There are amusing incidents, but overall it's a quiet film focusing more on personalities than on action.   Set in the fifties, it's an interesting view into Swedish and Norwegian life and thinking.  The Philadelphia Inquirer describes it as "Hilarious!" but I think that misleads people to think it is a slapstick comedy.  The conflict between the two men and the incidents intrigue and entertain, but it's not a rolling-on-the-floor kind of humor 
   A joyous and sexy romantic comedy that manages to insert heavy doses of drama (sometimes quite melancholy) and social commentary into itself without losing its overall playful, upbeat vibe, "Belle Epoque" is a treasure and a fantastic introduction to the world of Spanish-language comedy.  Set in the Spanish Civil War, a concsientious objector deserts the army and ups being offered refuge at the farm of a charming old intellectual, whose four daughters each end up taking a quick liking to the young - and perpetually flummoxed - desserter.  Filled with a large, great cast of diverse characters - including the farm father's eclectic group of friends and his unusual, absent-on-tour musician wife, and spearheaded by Penelope Cruz's smashing performance as Luz - "Belle Epoque" taps into a rich range of material and does it all extremely well.  An alltime winner 
 This is a follow-up to some other books written by Joseph Nevins on East Timor.  I found this book to be even better than his previously-written books, and a bit of an easier read.  In it, he talks about the complicity of many of the world powers in helping to create East Timor's sad recent history. Nevins also talks about what has been happening in East Timor since its new-found independence.  I would highly recommend this book to anybody interested in world politics/history, or people looking to expand their horizons and learn about a little-known country 
 This book is very helpful to any elementary teacher that is looking for ways to improve your reading curriculum.  Lucy Calkins gives plenty of ideas and new approaches to try in your classroom.  I also appreciate how she writes the actual scenario she used in the classroom with real kids.  It is so much easier to comprehend through real life experiences.  Another book that is similar, very informative and full of GREAT ideas is Reading Essentials by Regie Routman.  This is a must read as an educator.  
 Seth Godin has another hit with his latest, Free Prize Inside.  As the old adage goes, the best things in life are free.  Godin emphasizes that the common consumer is more influenced by the promise of something free rather than an advertisement that interrupts our time and that we did not really want to see anyway.  As a consumer, I think this is extremely accurate.  I am always enticed by the thought of a free gift, and I don't think that an ad has ever impacted me as much regarding my desire to buy an item or try a new restaurant.  His example of amazon.com is a great one.  Since amazon.com started offering free shipping, their sales have increased by 37%.  I know from personal experience, that free shipping is always a great way to get me to purchase anything from an online site.  Godin also goes through many ways of selling the idea of the free prize and deciding what that free prize should be.  This is a great book for any entrepeneur or any existing company, for it explains how to reel in the consumer and spend the money allotted for marketing in an efficient and effective way.  Godin really knows the hearts and minds of the American consumer, and this book is a great read for anyone interested in making a buck 
 Jim K. made a great review.....I just wanted to let you know that I agree. This is great. It is very light weight. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is that you need to zoom a bit or else you get a burnout effect (a circle where the corners are dark because it is getting the inside of the lens). That is annoying, and forces you to remove the extender when you want to take closer photos. At a distance though, it is great. Pictures come out great. I highly recommend this.....I would have given it 4.5 stars if it were an option 
 This is a great single disc collection of one of the biggest bands of the early 70s, but it has become outdated with the release of the Complete Hit Singles CD. All 20 songs here were top 40 hits, no fillers! The only hit missing is their last top 40 hit from 1975, Till The World Ends, which is included on Complete Hit Singles. Also, the songs on here are the album versions, not the 45 single versions. You probably wouldn't notice the difference except on Joy To The World, Liar, and Old Fashion Love Song. The album versions are still very good, it's just that the 45 versions were pumped-up a little and are better. If you want the 45 single versions including Till The World Ends, you will need to get the 2 CD collection Celebrate The Three Dog Night Story or their new Complete Hit Singles CD. While this was a good CD in its day, its day passed when Complete Hit Singles was released. Pass on this and buy Complete Hit Singles instead 
 I'm almost done with a recently released book I was given for Christmas, "Ten Hours Until Dawn." I began reading it but two days ago and don't want to put it down! A great read for the winter house-bound mariners up here, or for the most uninitiated landlubber. It's one of, if not the, best sea tales I've ever read.   It's the true story of the disasterous "Great Blizzard of '78" here at Ground Zero on the North Shore of Massachusetts, the grounding of the oil tanker Global Hope about two or three miles from us, and the rescue attempt turned disaster in the worst winter storm in over 100 years.   Between the herculean and selfless efforts of our local Coast Guard out of Gloucester and pilot boat captain Frank Quirk and his volunteer crew of his Can Do, the nail-biting descriptions of the almost unbelievable conditions out there in my sailing grounds, histories of similar marine crises, and the detailed but easily comprehensible explanations, it's one of those books that keeps you awake after midnight to read "just one more chapter."  This story holds a special significance for me not only because I'm so familiar with the locale and sail it every weekend during the season. During that historic storm I was living-aboard an old wooden 46' power boat tied up to our slip on D dock at Beverly Harbor Marina. Conditions got so bad by early evening that a group of us live-aboards got together with all the lines we had among us and we could get our hands on, tied off our dock to pilings and telephone poles and buildings in the parking lot above us. Above us, until the high-tide surge, when our floating dock rose above the hinged ramp, above the stationary wharf thereby stranding us on our boats, above even the sea wall and parking lot. We watched helplessly from our "island" as the rollers swept across the parking lot to our snow-buried cars! Two of the nearby boat-laden docks broke lose! The snow was so deep that if you didn't walk carefully down the very center of the rolling dock in the howling wind, it'd tip and dump you off.   Word had passed around in our marina that an oil tanker was aground just outside Beverly Harbor and that a rescue effort was underway. We saw the Coast Guard's 41-footer make it in to the Jubilee Yacht Club just next door. But we didn't learn about the tragedy just a few miles out until a day or two later; we were too busy ourselves that night to think to turn on the VHF radio. This is the first time I've learned the details -- and they were incredible, horrific!   I probably knew a few of the Coast Guardsmen quoted throughout who were out there facing death. During the summer of 1977 the Coast Guard used to love "boarding" us. Our boat had become a magnet for some of the ladies of an all-women's college just up the coast, and we four young live-aboards usually had a contingent of them aboard. When off-duty, a few of the Coasties would sometimes come down to the boat for a visit and a few brewskies, hoping we had company aboard.   Reading the details of what happened that night is chilling even almost thirty years later. I clearly recall how bad things were that night, but had no idea how much worse they were just a couple miles out in Salem Sound, or the life-and-death drama that was taking place. That *anyone* survived out there is a miracle -- that anyone *went* out there is unimaginable. 
 As a beginner, I am so glad I found this DVD.  I don't even mind the hour and a half long workout!  The movements are easy to understand and follow and Qigong has "kick-started" my body back to health! When I don't have time to practice all 18 movements, I do the short version that is provided at the beginning! Thank you Garrapolis 
 I have two boys 11 and almost 17 and both my boys loved it. and is a very great buy 
 If I were to recommend one diet book of the dozens I have read over the years, this would be it.  The book helps break down the day into about 6 smallish to medium meals, which is in stark contrast to the 3 large meals most Americans eat while snacking on junk trying not to starve in-between.  They lay out all of the healthy foods, including plenty of snack choices.  While a lot of this is basic info for the experienced dieter, actually putting it to use gets plenty of results.  For the first week or so of following the new meal style, I felt so full (a feeling I was unaccustomed to) that I was almost queasy.  But after a week, your stomach adjusts and you'll never have that empty gnawing hunger feeling again!  I started working out two weeks before I started following these diet layouts, so after 6 weeks of exercise (4 weeks on the new meal plan) I have lost over 15 pounds and 6 inches off my waistline.  I'm still a big girl, but I've already dropped 4 pants sizes!  I have my favorite 'fat jeans' set aside for one of those annoying after pictures - where I'll look like someone trying on MC Hammer pants.  For an easier change to the plan - start small, adding snacks like apples and baby carrots with peanut butter and have a small salad right before dinner and there's no way NOT to lose weight.  The only disagreement I have is in the way this diet views fat, I allow for a bit more in my day (but limited to the days I work out).  If anyone else out there is having success with this book, leave a review - reading them is not only fun but inspirational 
 I have been Dj'ing for over 20 years now. I have listened to a heck of a lot of Hip-Hop music over the years. I have the wax on this as well as the tape(and now the CD!) There are 10 tracks on this album and 7 out of them are simple classics. Of course, some of the tracks are not top notch but the lyrics overshaddow the track on most if not all Eric B and Rakim songs anyway. How this MC is not reguarded as the best of all time by everyone is beyond me. There are not many tracks of others that to this day you can go back and say 'damn, he said that!' This is a must have to anyone who gives a &$%# about hip-hop 
 College senior Phoebe Wycherly has gone missing and her wealthy father, California oilman Homer Wycherly is desperate to find her.  So, he hires veteran PI Lew Archer to track her down.  Most of the narrative unfolds in northern California, many miles away from Archer's home base in Los Angeles.  Reading The Wycherly Woman is a real joy because the plot, though complex, is smoothly laid out with each chapter logically leading to the next.  Also contributing to this novel's enjoyment quotient is the smart and plentiful dialogue Macdonald provides his characters.  As Archer steadfastly pursues the facts behind Phoebe's disappearance, the suspense builds and builds.  This has the effect of making The Wycherly Woman one of Ross Macdonald's most engaging mysteries.  I do, however, have to deduct one star from the rating.  The plot device on which the solution to the mystery rests, is based on one character assuming the identity of another with the use of a rather transparent form of disguise.  Though one could believe that some might be fooled by this, Macdonald has structured the plot such that Archer himself is also taken in.  And that goes against everything we know about the ace detective's ultra acute powers of observation, especially when it comes to "reading" people.  A flawed yet extremely well written example of hardboiled detective fiction 
 The key to change managment is communiation. A point jeffrey illustartes perfectly in his book.   Very helpful to any organisation or individual who is struggling with the concept of communicating change.  
  I would like to highly recommend the book "The Art of Urban Cycling:  Lessons from the Street" by Robert Hurst.  Not only is it delightfully written (with a sense of humour and a relaxed style) and absorbing ("just a second, dear, I'll take out the trash after I read about curbs"), but it's *dead on*.  I've been riding my whole life, never having owned a car, to get everywhere from school to grocery shopping to Canada.  And he's *right*.  Nevertheless, I've learned much from reading it.  Hurst advocates a practical and well-considered (not to mention well-tested and developed by very experienced riders), safety-oriented, philosophically coherent approach that I find very appealing.  He draws the best parts of Forester's well-established "vehicular-cycling" philosophy but drops the impractical and dangerous aspects of any strict adherence to it.   He advocates awareness, a consideration for others, and responsibility for one's own safety, above mere blind rule-following.  The book starts out with a history of cycling and the role it played in the development of our automobile society.  He shows us that the ties are deep and tangled, and encourages us to embrace the complex world that is the city street.  He then discusses the history of and previous philosophies of urban cycling before getting into the equally fascinating details of riding style, dangers, accidents, equipment, etc.  It's a wonderful book, both to read cover-to-cover for interest, and as a reference with a detailed index. 
 It's a great book that gives briefs, but very good comments, about the artists and their work

 This album, as almost everyone knows, is one of New Order's least critically acclaimed albums. The reasons are very simple--aside from a few more experiments with drum machines, there seems to be virtually no new territory covered from their time as Joy Division. And when you have Barney taking Ian's place, it only seems to get worse.  But you must consider that this was released a year after Closer. Of course, Joy Division grew by leaps and bounds from their punk days to Unknown Pleasures, and thence to Closer, but this level of growth could not be maintained by any band, especially one that lost their lead singer only a year before. They should be applauded for "moving" on--what Movement is all about.  And what about the music? If you are a fan of Joy Division's music, you will likely be a fan of this; I hear distinct echoes (but not rehashes) of "Atrocity Exhibition," "Komakino," "Insight," and "Decades." And if you are a fan of New Order's early singles or Power, Corruption & Lies, you will probably like this, too, with certain tracks looking forward to "Blue Monday" and "Age of Consent."   This album is very, even surprisingly, enjoyable despite its historically lukewarm to negative reviews--it has both Martin Hannett's atmospheric, moody mix and some of the experiments with electronica that Joy Division was already starting to experiment with. If anything, the energy and brilliance of Movement should convince anyone that Joy Division was not Ian Curtis's solo act (as undoubtedly important as he was). And if this were viewed by critics as a debut (which it arguably is) instead of as a disappointing follow-up to Closer, it would have had the fair reception it deserves 
 Alice Morse Earle has written several books on life in Colonial America.  This is the first one of her books  I've read, and I am eager to move on to another volume, perhaps Child Life in Colonial Days. Mrs. Earle's  "Home Life" is a fascinating description of everyday life --- the  chores, the tools, the dwelling places, the foods, the sights and sounds  --- that Colonial Americans knew.   Have you ever seen a strange tool or  implement in a museum, an antique shop, or hanging on the wall at a country  restaurant, and no one seems to know exactly what it is or what it was used  for?  Read this book: its many illustrations will more than likely include  that mysterious object; and Mrs. Earle will describe clearly what it was  and how it was used.  This book should be in the library of every  enthusiast of American antiques.  Without a doubt, this book contains  information found nowhere else in a book now in print. This is not a  history of Colonial America --- although it contains many interesting  tidbits about our country's earliest days.  It is, however, an excellent  description of everyday life in  America, 1600 - 1800, with special  emphasis on New England and Virginia.  As such, this book would be useful  not just to historians and antique collectors, but to writers, museum  curators, and anyone who wants to understand Colonial America 
 I was recently enlightening by finding the series involving the Moosepath League, and enjoyed Fiddlers green as a wonderful summer read.  The characters and story developed by Mr. Reid are rare in most of the books I have read recently, and I sincerely hope he plans to continue the series with its charming characters and stories that I would describe as good, clean, fun 
 The episodes continue Samurai Jack's quest to return to the past and defeat evil super demon Aku, but what makes the series enjoyable is the different styles and how each story is told.  Each of the characters has their own dynamic personalities that liven up each episode.  One episode is told in a bug's life/ Alice in Wonderland Theme (excellent use of music to pace the story), another describes what goes into hagas, and the finale has biker go-bots as bullies with a Ned Fanders? type character helping Jack. There is also an episode that honors the 300 Spartans.  Jack being the learning hero, learns new skills from different characters and goes out of his way to help those in need.  He makes friends and comes to their assistance for it is the honorable way of the Samurai.  Once the action starts flowing, the scenes move in the artist's own unique style.  Each episode of the series seems to pull the view more and more into watching the series.    The two disc set is very fun to watch and is presented as a quality product for the fans to enjoy.   
 No matter how many times I hear it, "Not Ready To Make Nice" sends chills up my spine and puts a tear into my eye. Off the top of my head, I cannot think of a more powerful song. This CD has heart, soul, anger and politics all rolled into a musical package that sometimes sounds more like "Rumours"-era Fleetwood Mac than anything country. But make no mistake, the fact that it is a country record is what gives this CD even more legs. It's been said that the best music is made during periods of Republican leadership. Look no further than this CD to see the truth of that statement. Not ready to make nice, indeed.  And see the movie 
 This book was required reading for an undergraduate sociology course for Human Relations majors (sociology course for sociology/education/psychology). It was an eye opening experience because the readers/continuous learner is encouraged to step inside the corporate framework that directly affects our ideas and acceptance of an ideology of busines, etc based on the McDonald's corporate culture.  Our class found it powerful reading and most were challenged to think about and ask, "what are we really doing to improve our lives, culture and global community? 
 At first I was like "um...no," but then I continued watching because I rented the disks from Netflix and then I ended up laughing my ass off. This is a weird comedy show. The timing is really strange, because it is improvised apparently. Now I can't get enough of the show. Larry David is just so...inappropriate sometimes it makes you die laughing. And the cast is just great too. They all play it off like pros. I have ordered the series now and can't wait to watch them all again. One episode was so funny I had to watch it like four times in a row. Maybe that says something strange about my creepy life that I'm watching Larry David so much, but c'est la vie! My advice is to watch the entire first season and see if it doesn't sink into your skin. Larry David's humor is not for everyone, but if you are smart and kind of dorky sometimes with a wicked sense of humor you should like this 
 This book is an essential investment for enabling the inventor to take the right steps, and beware of the pitfalls of rip-off marketing companies and scams, with the thousands of dollars they charge.  The Special Bonus Workbook enables you to get started right away, and numerous Bookmark references refer you to the main part of the book for more detail and with many Words of Wisdom.  Another useful inclusion are the printable versions of the worksheets from the website for proceeding with commercialization of the product.  Valuable contacts of Local Inventors Organizations are also listed to help support inventors.  Finally, quoting from the book, "If you perform the exercises in the Workbook enough times, before you know it the process will flow intuitively. Interviewing people, who you have never met, can actually be fun, and you can make new friends. So relax and enjoy yourself.   
 This Turbo scratcher is appealing to cats, even if they reject most scratching posts.  The ping pong ball adds an element of excitement.  I have 5 cats, and they all like to play with this toy 
 Arsenal's home jersey's are red, but their away jersey's are yellow.  Travelling fans will often wear their home jersey's when following their team on the road, but the team will naturally be wearing their away jerseys.  This is consistent for all teams across Europe - different colour home and away kits 
 this was a present to a cousin of mine that had always wanted to have this movie for the sake of good old times 
 I was having excruciating pain in my right buttock area and an MRI showed a herniated disc.  Well of course after phys therapy, steroids, etc., surgery was the option left.  Just the word surgery made my pain worse and I was really scared.  I first read Mind Over Back Pain, then in chron order, Dr. Sarno's other books, this one being the latest.  I enjoyed how he shared the new things he learned in each book. I then said to myself this could be TMS (tension myositis syndrome--pain caused by oxygen deprivation to muscle or nerve or tendon or ligament due to brain). I decided to see Dr. Sarno and was diagnosed thankfully with TMS.  He did look at my MRI and said the herniation was large, but likely not the cause of my pain.  I have followed his study program which is outlined well in this book and 2 weeks later the pain is basically gone.  I am able to walk or sit with no burning or pain, even drive, which I had not done for weeks.   Dr. Sarno's conviction in what he is doing and saying was thrilling to witness. And unlike other doctors, there is no "it could be . . . " and so "try this . . ." It is "you have TMS", this is why, and here is what to do.  I loved hearing that from him.  I highly recommend all his books.  I am grateful to Dr. Sarno for writing these books and helping me be pain-free and I've told him so! I was NOT a skeptic from the beginning, however, as I believe strongly that our mind (emotion) affects our body.  If you are open to learning how you can realize and accept things about yourself, your life, and your childhood, read Dr. Sarno's books.   I am thrilled I am pain-free with no surgery!     So many people have similar problems and pains, but I have seen that some are not willing to accept that their mind plays a major role and there is personal work involved.  I highly recommend this book.  There is explanation of TMS, whom it affects and what to do about it, other doctors' experiences, history of other professionals (living and deceased) realizing the brain plays a part in our physical health, letters from patients, etc.  It is a great book.  Read it and see for yourself 
 White Women, Race Matters is one of the first books which takes on the monumental task of 'decentralizing' white culture.  Through interviews with white women, the author describes, delineates and discusses not only  'whiteness' but how and why we (they) construct it.  While this is an  academic book, it would be beneficial reading for almost every American 
 The Judas Priest documentary the other reviewer mentioned is Heavy Metal Parking Lot by Jeff Krulik. It's not available on Amazon, or any mass market vendor, unfortunately, but you can read about it, and about his other films, at his website. (Google 'Krulik') I recommend the 'Krulik and Friends' compilation tape, if you can find it. Both Chris Smith films and Krulik's films are documentaries with offbeat humor and a collection of oddball people as subjects, which are treated with love in the final analysis, though you may laugh AT them at first (like Mark and Mike in American Movie). People who enjoy one would likely enjoy the other, I think 
 This is great at keeping my 1 yr old occupied during my big shopping days! I have tried other strollers. Go with the Limited! It has noises on the toys that keep him busy. Not to mention the inquiries I get from other parents!   It is not hard for me to get it in my Yukon. Howver, I have to put it in the front seat in my husband's Maxima as it does not fold real flat. 
 Jim Cramer rules.  Anyone who can mix schadenfreude (German for vicarious pleasure in others' misery), Pangloss from CANDIDE, sports analogies, and pop culture references with a straight shooting approach to finance and investing is cool.  More importantly, he does a better, more readable job of dissecting big bad Corporate America than Michael Moore ever could (Cramer and Moore both got skewed in a bad-guy list of RADAR that stated the scariest facts about both, respectively, were "Is married and has children," and "Won an Oscar").  Jim Cramer isn't a get-rich-quick franchise 
 This novel is superb.  Oh, so Berry may not create hyper plots but then such plots usually numb more than they inspire.  He writes from a deep well focusing on place, person, and love.  Not love in some sappy, sentimental sense, but love rooted in knowledge.  The prose is luminous.  It's like Berry found a way to turn his poetry into a novel.    This is a deep reading experience.  You'll overhear the story of a woman who lost her mother, than her first husband, but found a place in which to make a world, a kind of new world, almost a new Jerusalem (it is sacred ground in the best, ordinary sense).    
 This book is awesome! They are two of the most wonderful and influential yoga teachers in the West, and they're showing that yoga can be fun. The text is so touching and I use it for a "quote guide", pulling some of the beautiful sayings out for everyday notes and letters. I've bought a copy for everyone I know who practices yoga, including myself. It's a refreshing change from the many textbooks available. I recommend it to anyone wishing to perk up their coffee table 
 The recent Ballad of Congressman Mark Foley initiated these comments.  Serge, jaded and driving his Silver Ghost Rolls Royce, with its "Venus of Money of 1910 posed on the radiator," swerves off the road to find a "white skirt tied onto black pants" calling herself "Melody Nelson" with natural red curls.  Evidently Serge wants an English trophy to go along with his fancy English machine!  Her age?  "Quatorze automnes - Et quinze ï¿½tï¿½s - Un petit animal."    Best not translated.  Anyway, this stuff wouldn't pass muster in the USA today.    I give "Melody Nelson" five stars for the beauty of its orchestral arrangements.  Serge really knew how to get the groove out of his session musicians!!  Check out "Requiem por un con" for further grooviness.  Unfortunately this record is only 32 minutes long 
 WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. These are the three slogans that Winston Smith hears every day.  When I first read this book 35 years ago, the threat of such a freedomless world seemed impossible to me. After all...we are not Russia.  Today, the words of the book are dangerously true.   WAR IS PEACE.  Have we not started a preemptive war against another country for the ostensible purpose of peace?   IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.  Don't some of our public schools and libraries censor books or resist the teaching of contemporary biology?  What about the THOUGHT POLICE.  Today in America, an individual can be convicted by introducting into evidence information that he or she reviewed from his computer in the privacy of his home.  The books we read, the videos we rent, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive are all easily accessible by lw enforcement agencies. New technology allows scientists to scan our brains to determine if we are telling the truth. Yes...BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING US.  Listen to this CD, read Orwell, and start a movement that prevents any further inroads into our thoughts and privacy.    
 I've read this book twice already, and will likely read it again. Tobias Wolff is probably my favorite writer, and he is also, in my opinion, the humblest writer around. Humble is a strange word to use, but I think it's true. His prose is distinctly unflashy--very spare and simple. So are his subjects. This is a very quiet book about students and teachers and their love for literature--albeit an awkward, often misguided love. There is no graphic sex, no horrific suicides or car crashes (although there is the palpable thrill of the lie, and the agony of getting caught).  Tobias Wolff chooses small subjects and writes about them with total clarity and total restraint. His words and phrases are carefully chosen: each sentence leads logically to the next; every paragraph begins with a declarative statement and ends with some kind of conclusion. I think this clarity is the reason so many writing students admire him. Wolff is like a magician who does his tricks in the open:  you can watch his every move up-close, with your own eyes, and yet you still can't quite figure out how he pulls it off.   Wolff's deceptively simple style also extends to the form of the novel, which is very linear and straightforward. The plot revolves around a writing contest played out in three acts (the three visiting judges: Frost, Rand, and Hemingway). The setup is so basic, and yet the results are complex and surprising. It reminds me of a musical fugue, with a basic substructure rolled out in endless intricacy. And, like a fugue, the novel ends with a beautifully elegant coda, in the form of a prodigal son story. Many reviewers here have maligned this ending, but it fits perfectly into the themes of the novel--the struggle to be "true" to oneself and the world; the shame of ostracism; and the exuberance of being forgiven and welcomed home. What at first it seems like an arbitrary tangent turns out to be a poetic parallel to the boy's own story. And what a lovely last sentence! I had to read it aloud, more than once.  And have I neglected to say how funny this book is?  It is!  Hilarious! Watch on with utter horror as famous authors--brought to pitch-perfect life by Wolff--take themselves far too seriously in public! Cover your ears while intelligent young students spin out cliché-soaked stories about hunting trips gone awry and alien visitations!  What else can I say? Buy the book. I wouldn't expect everyone to like it. In fact, the first time through I was much less excited about it than I am now. But it is a book that rewards slow, careful reading. If this is your style, I think you will not be disappointed with this (or any other T. Wolff) book. 
 Lantz has created a deck that combines fantasy, goth, magick, wisdom, modern art, and flare to create a new and exciting Tarot deck.  The deck is on the darker side, but in a very natural, non-obtrusive way.  This deck combines traditional Tarot images with new, yet applicable, imagery that gives the Archeon Tarot its own unique readability.    Conventionally, the deck has a very high-gloss finish, and its the perfect size for shuffling.  Because of the glossy finish, the cards are very durable and will last a very long time.  Go for it if your hesitating--you won't regret it 
 Creating A New Old House: Yesterday's Character For Today's Home by Russell Versaci (an experienced home designer and a founding member of The Institute for Traditional Architecture) is an impressively organized and presented guide to recapturing images, impressions, and positive virtues drawn from past traditions of interior decor in today's homes. Superbly showcasing full-color photographs in order bring interior design principles and ideals to light, Creating A New Old House is a simply beautiful concept sourcebook for adding a strong touch of enduring flavor to one's dwelling and a welcome addition to professional, academic, and community library Interior Design reference shelves 
 It doesn't get much better than that.  I still don't get why this is labeled as a book for kids.  In my opinion it stands up with any other Discworld book, and oh yes it is a Discworld book!  DEATH even puts in an appearance.  Who knew you couldn't take mustard with you?  Add in the Feegles, and this book has many of my favorite characters in it.  Mix that in with Terry's usual casual mix of hilarity while subtly saying profound things about human nature, and why would you even need to hear about the plot from me?  You *might* want to go and get The Wee Free Men and A Hat Full of Sky before you read this, if you really want to be clued in, mind 
 I read this book a few weeks ago and it was amazing!! I really recomend this book to anyone who wants to read a good story!! 
 Well written and documented overwiew  But it lacks a bibliography for further readin 
 My interest in the band "Garbage" led me to this book - its title was used by them to create a chillingly magnificent song on their second CD. I found the book itself to be one of the most creative and compelling works I read this year. The story it tells gets under your skin to such a point that I don't recommend it for those already depressed. For the rest of us, it is a chilling look inside a sympathetic character, a young woman dancing around the border between sanity and madness. She knows she is on the verge of losing it all, and knows she is not getting the kind of help she needs from anyone - least of all the mediocre medical personnel who see her as just one more casefile. Yet she's unable to shake the helplessness and displays the lack of will to take control of her own life which is so often found in the insane and/or suicidal. Galloway makes extremely skilled use of innovative page layouts and even unexpected graphics to really show us her character's imbalanced view of the world. We see through her eyes 
 I think that his first novel, although he had written plenty of short stories (and would only add to that number . . . the ten volume series reprinting all his short stories is a godsend, check it out!).  The plot  isn't so much science fiction as borderline fantasy, Horty is a young man  caught doing something disgusting behind the bleachers (you'll probably  laugh when you find out what it is, either Sturgeon was making some sort of  a joke or people were really different back in the fifties) and his mean  stepfather "accidentally" severs three of his fingers (though not  the most disgusting finger severing sequence, the second one is far more  disturbing), so he runs off and joins the circus.  The plot starts to twist  and turn at that point and jump ahead, sometimes not to its complete  benefit, a lot of things either don't get explained or aren't explained  well (the origins of the jewels and what they do does seem to change as the  story progresses) but the thing that hooks you in and keeps you reading is  Sturgeon's overriding compassion and love for everything and everyone.  He  can find something sympathetic is just about everyone (the only character  that I couldn't like even some small part was Horty's stepfather, I found  him mostly pathetic but that was the point), even the dreaded Maneater has  some redeeming values.  There's a lot of touching scenes, especially as  Horty comes to grips with what he might be and the consequences of that.   Really it's just a heartwarming novel written by a guy who had a great  store of humanity and showed it in his stories.  Never dripping with  sentiment to the point where you feel like you're overwhelmed with emotion,  the book remains compulsive reading and just as essential reading as his  other two novels (More Than Human and Venus Plus X), he keeps things brisk  and moving.  Simply put, he showed right from the start that even in the  beginning he was as good as the best.  And he only got better from here 
 This dictionary is not only a great resource for Arabic speakers who want to learn English and American culture, but it is also extremely valuable to an English speaker who is seriously studying Arabic.  Many of the reviews have valid complaints.  If you purchase this book expecting to use it to speak Arabic quickly because you are traveling to the Arab world, this will not be of any use to you.  If, however, you have been studying Arabic, or plan to learn to read the script, you will find this dictionary very useful.  As for this not being "real" Arabic, one needs to know that Arabic is a complex language.  There is a written, more classical standard form and then there are many colloquial dialects that are spoken and not written.  The spoken words can be simliar or completely different from the written form.  What you see in this dictionary is the standard written form.  If you use some of these phrases in an Arabic speaking country a vast majority of people will understand what you are saying.  They may inform you of the spoken form of the word, but they will understand you.  If you rely on phonetic Arabic transliteration into English, then this book will disappoint you.  You must already have a basic understanding of the Arabic script and pronunciation.  There is also no voweling for the Arabic words, which makes it even more difficult to discern.   The Arabic script is smaller than the English, but this is how you will find all type-written Arabic (and even most hand-written Arabic as well!).    My husband and I are using this to supplement our full-time study of Arabic and I also use it to teach EFL to Arabic speakers.  It has been a wonderful resource and I plan to order more to share with family and friends 
 The Skechers Bikers Escape is a veratile option for the sensitive footed. Decent arch support for my tiny, flat feet, with enough cushioning to keep them happy for hours of shopping! Initially, the band across the instep can be a little tight and had a touch of a heel rub, but both have improved during the break in period. They seem to dress up a pair of jeans, and so far have gotten away with wearing them with a skirt...hee hee! Bought a pair in brown as well! 
 The family figures arrived well-packaged and in perfect shape.  My granddaughter will be delighted with the additional family piece 
 Never even knew about this CD,until here recently. A 1985 reunion between two original Blue Cheer members, bassist / vocalist Dickie Peterson and drummer Paul Whaley. They had guitarist Tony Rainier play on this one album. I was a bit caught off guard. I mean,this CD is better than what I expected. Title has several reworkings of older tunes, like "Summertime Blues" and "Out Of Focus", but also good newly penned tracks like the rocker "Ride With Me", "Girl Next Door" and "Heart Of The City". So even though 'Beast Is Back...' is half new, half old material, it's still a worthy pick. Good revived late '60's heavy rock. Check it out 
 Was pleased at the quality and comfort (according to my husband) of these slippers. Would recommend these slippers 
 I use this book annually to introduce tangrams into my geometryunit. The information from the back of the book adds a multiculturaland historical dimension to the lesson while the relationship between grandfather and granddaughter offers an intergenerational link. Reading the book in an interactive mode, I use my own renditions of Grandfather Tang's animals mounted on poster boards and flipped over to be uncovered as the story progresses. The kids are completely engaged trying to guess what the next fairy transformation will be before it's revealed. By the end of the book, they are excited to create their own tangram pictures to form into a class book. The soft watercolor illustrations are a balanced contrast to the energy and enthusiasm Grandfather Tang's Story generates with my class 
 Like Halloween 3, people were disappointed that the famed killer doesn't make an appearance in the film, but people also forget that the original movie didn't have Jason in it either. Overall, I really do enjoy this movie and I found it really well reason. At the end of the film, they actually give a reason as to why all of the killing in the movie happened, and it is very similar to the reasons Mrs. Voorhees had in the original film. No, Jason is not in this movie, but it is still very interesting and good. However, if you are looking for Jason, you won't find it here. 
 My work has provided me with the opportunity to travel a good bit.  I am the type of person who wants to get a working background for my destinations, both in terms of history and geographic layout.  Because I work, I don't have a great deal of time to spend reading and studying different, often lengthy, travel guides before or during my trips.      Because these guides are concise, beautifully illustrated, relatively compact, and impeccably organized, I cannot recommend highly enough the Dorling Kindersley Eyewitness Travel Guides!  The DK Eyewitness Travel Guide is THE guide I buy for every destination.  Not only do I get a quick history and background of the destination, but I also will be provided with a visual guide to everything.  The visual detail is really what sets the DK Eyewitness Travel Guides apart.  The street maps of common destination points are drawn in dimensional detail so you will visually recognize when you "get there."  The regional maps are colorful and concise.  And the drawings associated with attractions like museums allow the traveler who is short on time to quickly see the best of the museum within the time the traveler has to spend.  Each DK Eyewitness Travel Guide has a good summary section in the back with practical information about where to eat, where to sleep, what to do, and how to get around.    While I may supplement the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide with others for a more detailed travel guide, the other guide is only more to read, not more to see.  Buy the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide first for any destination.   
 This book is easy to read, with sensible suggestions that can be incorporated into your life with relative ease 
 This is a great war movie about a Russian unit, it is very detailed 
 Carlotta Carlysle drives a cab, has convoluted love life and precocious little sister, but has time to take on bad guys and lead her reader on a non-stop thrill ride as she ferrets out illegal alien underworld.  A real page-turner.  A must-read if you like Sue Grafton's books 
 This movie is really great. I LOVED IT!! I won't give away any of it because it would probably give away too much. GO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S GREAT and FUNNY!!!!!! DEFINETLY A MUST SEE!! 
 By 1980 when this disc was originally released as an Lp Pharoah Sanders was solidly entrenched with his own voice on tenor. The passing  of John Coltrane and Sanders's  fruitfull years of playing with the prolific saxophone genius resulted with an umistakable influence on his sound and explorations of the instrument. Pharoah Sanders plays both hot and cool jazz on this disc , traditional arrangements as well as experimental passages are woven together tighly for a snapshot of a man who has found his own voice and leadership in the jazz idiom. Beginning with  "Greetings to Idris " the structure of the music is one that follows tradition yet opens up for the musicians to  improvise within the arrangements. "Greetings to Idris " is in reference to the featured drummer  Idris Muhammad who also played with Coltrane during his late period. Naturally Sanders is featured as  the main instrument and his horn can be bold  and demanding of your full attention. Always interested in other instruments from other cultures , much like Trane, he incorporates the Japanese instrument the koto, a beautifully harmonic stringed intrument counter to his soft rich blowing on tenor with only  wind chimes and a harmonium for a delicious peaceful bit of music on "Kazuko"(Peace Child) that has the qualities of  a meditative offering. Most of the music, eight tracks,  is composed and arranged by Sanders  and  demonstrates his leadership. There is one John Coltrane composition entitled "After The Rain" that gets the Tranesque treatment by Sanders that makes it hard for even the most discerning listener to distinquish between the original version and Sanders impression.  It is a bluesy duet  featuring only sax and piano and leaves you wanting to hear it over and over again because of it's simple and haunting melodies. Another song  that Coltrane recorded entitled  "Easy To Remember " has  a gentle swing to it built around a classic quartet (drums, bass, piano, sax) like that employed by Coltrane that results in superb standard.  Pharoah Sanders shifts gears quite a bit on this disc. Sanders incorporates the use of another "foreign" instrument to jazz by working in a tabla and sitar on "Soledad " that takes center stage before Sanders joins in on the music. The result is a thing of genius as the East and West merge and interface for composition that is peacefull. Sanders music on this disc flucuates between the tranquil sounds of his mellow horn to the outer limits where he left off with the explorations of Trane's late period. What seperates this disc from others is that it is a group playing under his leadership where he gives all others close to equal billing. The uptempo, " You've Got To Have freedom " is one such song where Sanders gets out there on some of his solos but works within the group structure as the other  musicians,  most notably  Eddie Henderson on flugelhorn, bring the music back home. There is  a chorus sung much of the time throughout where the the proclamation "Ya gotta have peace and love, ya gotta have freedom"  is presented in Manhattan Transfer style but with much more soul. The use of vocalists is done again  on the track entitled "Think About The One."  The chorus features  voacalese specialist Bobby McFerrin who later went on to work on his own and to colloborate with many other   major talents and is probably best known for the song "Don't Worry Be Happy." The Tranesque tenor of Sanders plays a striking counter to the chorus in the musical statement that begs the  metaphysical question in  a sort of gospel tinged, vocalese thought provoking way. This disc shows the different sides of Pharoah Sanders, a man always willing to explore the music, explore his soul and share it with you. The closing track "Bedria" is a mellow exploration of the various ranges of the tenor. The full, rich tones produced are some of the best I have heard from his horn and I've heard many a Pharoah Sanders number. It is a ten minute song  that displays all the grace of his being, a gentle giant who can manipulate the horn to do extraordinary things , reveberating out and back in undulating waves of harmonic bliss. Sanders on this disc is next to perfect. One of his best recording from  his post  Impulse career. It belongs in your jazz collection right next to John Coltrane 
 I didn't expect much from this book when I first picked it up- I liked the art on the cover and the way the old pages looked.  It sat on my shelf looking pretty for a few months before I actually decided to read it, but once I actually did I couldn't believe I hadn't read it before.  Green Darkness is one of those books that makes you late because you don't want to leave it.  There's something about the way Seton writes her characters that's tangible: as long ago as it was written, as long ago as the events are placed, whether the characters charm or appall you the way they're written you can understand their hopes and plights and pains.  The story deals with the interaction of past lives and consequences on the present, all of this is explained by many of the other reviewers well enough.  But as much as you know what's going to happen in the book you're just compelled to keep reading and see it for yourself.  It's painful what happens, but it really is all right again in the end.  I expected nothing from this book when I bought it and ended up reading the last two thirds of it in a single nine hour session because I just couldn't bear to put it down again.  I've rarely been touched this much by a book about characters I've never heard of before and I can't recommend it enough 
 Hilariously, I found this book in a local library, in the section devoted to primary school and high school maths. I guess the "Algebra" in the title suggested this location to some librarian. Anyhow, not to worry. I informed the library and they will reshelve this book in a better place.  And what of the book itself? It makes an excellent text for an undergrad maths course. In no small part because the authors have stuffed a huge number of exercises into each chapter. An intense workout for the dedicated reader, and a wide variety of choices to the instructor.  Ring and module theories are developed at a fairly rigourous pace. While finite dimensional vector spaces are also covered, as a natural accompaniment. Some readers might be already familiar with its treatment of matrix manipulations and multilinearity. Indeed, the use of matrices may be more natural to you, when modules are discussed 
 The cast may be small, but there's an aura to this juvenile classic, the first in Aiken's long series, that reminds us of Charley D. at his best.  In what seems to be pre-Victorian England, Bonnie Green, daughter of Sir Willoughby Green, the Squire of Willoughby Chase, is to be left in the care of a governess, Miss Slighcarp, while her parents go on a voyage abroad to restore her mother's health.  Her orphaned cousin Sylvia comes from London to keep her company.  What neither girl knows is that Miss Slighcarp has an agenda, and it doesn't bode well for them.  With the help of Bonnie's loyal maid Pattern, the good footman James, and Bonnie's young friend Simon, a boy who lives in a cave in the Chase park and raises geese for sale, they manage to escape from the cruel "charity school" to which Miss Slighcarp commits them, gain the aid of a young physician and Sir Willoughby's attorney, and foil their wicked governess, and all comes right in the end.  There are, however, chills and near escapes galore--an attack by wolves on a railroad train, skulkings through secret passages in the walls of the great house, and an epic journey from the industrial city of Blastburn (possibly an analog of Birmingham) to London.  Bonnie, plucky and quick-tempered, and Sylvia, more retiring and ladylike, are distinct individuals and Simon is a splendid young guardian for them--and not without ambition: he has artistic talent and dreams of becoming a painter.  A delightful book to read aloud or enjoy quietly, this title hasn't been OP since it first appeared, and enjoys the seal of approval of the prestigious Accelerated Reader program.  Every family should own a copy 
 If you have already made it, then pass it on.  Fed up at my possibilities at age 50 and fed up with the system I was introduced in my college years, I have spent thousands of dollars in the past couple of years for the information in this book.  This is an absolute MUST READ for every person stuck in a dead end rut, as well as the young person thinking about life after high school.  All the answers are here for the proper mind set, which is tantamount for harnessing passion for life after high school.  This author has it all together in terms of offering proper advice speaking to passion and not academics!!  I can't say enough about how refreshing this read is.........Go for all he has to share.  So many websites and phone referrals..get your highlighter out.  You will have plenty of action to follow up on.......FABULOUS book for the young person and reiteration for the already entrepreneur......GREAT BOOK!  It will not disappoint 
 Several years ago I lost a lot of weight with this diet. I enjoyed the food and felt very good, with increased energy.  However, it works better for some people than others.  There are a few possible deficiencies - Dr. McDougall is very strict on avoiding fats, and I found that unless I supplemented the diet with ground flaxseed every day (for extra Omega 3 fat) I began to develop skin problems.  Also, it is a starch-based diet, and for many people, even healthy starches can impair weight loss and lead to food cravings and overeating.  Dr. McDougall is also excessively concerned about the consumption of even vegetable protein (which from all I can learn is not harmful like animal protein), so he encourages eating sometimes relatively nutrient-deficient foods like potatoes and limits more nutritious but protein-heavy beans, as well as limiting fruit for fear of causing high triglycerides. (The high triglycerides actually often are encouraged by excessive starch intake.)  He also seems a little too comfortable with the use of overly processed foods like pasta (though not on the Maximum Weight Loss diet) and salty/sugary condiments, which can reduce weight loss for some people.  Much as I admire Dr. McDougall for his ground-breaking research and lifelong devotion to helping people regain their health, I do think that the very best weight loss book available today, based on extensive, thoroughly up-to-date research as well as years of clinical practice, is Dr. Fuhrman's "Eat To Live."  This is the closest anybody's ever come to a diet tailored to the exact needs of the human body, both for maximum weight loss and maximum good health.  I can feel the difference in my vitality and energy when I'm on Dr. Fuhrman's program, which is based on the most nutrient-dense foods available - green vegetables, along with fruits, beans, and a little nuts and seeds.  Healthy starches, although still good foods, come a poor fifth in the nutrient ratings and are limited on this program, particularly for weight loss. After a while, you find that truly nutritious food is much, much more satisfying than anything else. I was really shocked to discover that eating enough romaine lettuce completely eliminated my bad food cravings!  Both weight loss and health benefits on Dr. Fuhrman's diet are if anything even more spectacular than on Dr. McDougall's, and in the long term I think Dr. Fuhrman's diet will result in the best level of health.  I find it also more varied, more pleasant, and more flexible.  Dr. McDougall's program is a huge advance over most diets, and all his books are educational and well worth reading.  However, for the most sophisticated yet simple information on how to reach your highest possible level of health and lose weight the most easily, you should also check out Dr. Fuhrman 
 I really liked this book alot..it was hard to put down. I kept figuring out the mysteries, but knew at the end I would be proven wrong and would have a great surprise..well..all my guesses were right. I would have given this book 5 stars, but because of the ending, I gave it 4. It ended to fast and everything was wrapped up quickly with a nice little bow. With all the drama and suspense in the book, the ending was a disappointment 
 Janov writes a compelling and extremely readable account of the new paradigm in psychology that he innovated, Primal Therapy. This is one of the seminal works in Psychology;  it is very important and I highly recommend it 
 I really like this movie. It is very cute and different from Audrey Hepburns other rolls. I think that she and George Peppard do a great job and I would recommend it to anybody that likes happy, romantic movies.In this movie Audrey plays an escort and George Peppard plays a Gigolo and they wind up living in the same apartment building. Of course I'm sure you can figure out what happens 
 A well known publisher/editor once said, "the purpose of a newspaper is to make money."  In the case of the "Union-Register," the newspaper has been acquired by a large corporation that treats its chain of newspapers like it treats its chain of fast food restaurants.  The newspaper is now being managed by corporate suits whose attention is on the bottom line rather than the local news.  Jack Tagger, a staff writer on the paper, finds himself demoted to writing obits after irritating the corporation's chief executive.  Writing an obituary gives new direction to Tagger's career after the deceased, James Bradley Stomarti, is indentified as the musician Jimmy Stoma, well known by Tagger's generation.  Digging into Stoma's death raises questions.  Stoma's widow, Cleo Rio, does not seem unhappy about his sudden demise, and is using the death as PR for her own career.  Tagger links up with Stoma's sister and others to carry out his own investigation.  Things can be deadly as other people are attacked and/or killed, and homes are ransacked.  Someone is looking for something.  Cleo Rio claims Stoma was producing her new CD, but there is some mystery about just what Stoma was producing.  There is unpublished music involved, and a question about who owns what.  People are maneuvering for control if they can find the music.  Meanwhile, back at the newspaper, there is a separate power struggle.  Foreign corporations are trying to take control.  The newspaper's previous owner has a large block of corporate stock which is key to the issue.  Tagger finds himself in the middle of both power struggles and, in the meantime, is obsessed with finding out what happened to his own father.  This is one of those novels that the reader gets involved in, and it will keep you up late to get to the end.  Just when it looks like a black hat will walk away whole, there is a surprising twist in the tale 
 I confess to be a huge fan of Will and Ariel Durant's work and confess to being fastinated with "lists."  That being said, it is obvious that I liked this work.  It is short and pretty much to the point.  The author clearly states that these are his selections and states "I let the reader, then, to make his own lists, helping himself to what he likes in mine.  Let him try to build for himself another perspective and unity that shall clarify human development for him."  I note that much of the negative comments, here in these reviews, centered on the fact that the particular reviewer did not agree with all of Dr. Durant's choices.  These reviewers need to read the last paragraph in the book.  Anyway, I, like most, did not agree with all the choices, but I suspect that if you picked 1,000 individuals and invited them to create their own list of the categories Durant chose, we would have before us 1,000 different lists.  Durant's writing is as always, wonderful, has a almost musical quality and is quite spellbinding. This is the type of work which should lead the reader to continue exploring history, art, poetry and philosophy on his or her own.  It is a work that should stimulate further reading and study.  As one reviewer pointed out, they were disappointed that the author did not delve deeper into his subjects and subject matter.  Hey folks, this is a short work of short essays.  If you want more delving, then do like the rest of us....go to the library or book store and go for it! I highly recommend this one! 
 The man who walked between the towers is a very good book.It have details and good pictures.I rated it for 5 stars the book was so good. I keep reading it over and  over again.And i never get tired of it.I wish the writer keep writing good book.And i'll always read it forever 
 In a small southern town, a family must fight against rising taxes, encroaching developers, devastating illness and their own demons to face themselves - and each other - and find long-needed forgiveness.    Acclaimed bestselling author Mary Alice Monroe ("Skyward," "The Beach House"), an active conservationist, also weaves into her tender plot and deftly-drawn characters a gentle message about preservation.  A lyrical tale of reconciliation and redemption, set against the backdrop of South Carolina's lowcountry 
 Baldacci shows his storytelling mastery.  Saving Faith will not disappoint with this plot driven race to the finish.  A fascinating look into the world of Washington lobbyists and the interests they serve.  Plenty of blackmail and surprising twists. Top notch elements of suspense and mystery will keep the pages turning. 
 This is one of the MOST insteresting books I have ever read.  I go though several of Ms. Hampl's explorations upon people and life which I found both intriguing and informative.  I especially enjoyed the chapter about Edith Stein.  (Try reading at least that chapter and see if it entices you too. 
 An amazingly good medical thriller. I love a heroine like Ev...strong, sexy, funny. I highly recommend the first novel in the series, Blood Run 
 My husband and I are very pleased with Shawn and Joanna's Couples Ultimate Dance Sampler.  We learned something on every dance that we had not learned yet.  We also learned the differences between some of the dances.  We were very Pleased. 
 This musical is about wanting to get out of the life you live.  In the case of Shirley Maclaine's character, it's about her finally trying to stop compromising on her ideals of love and quit her hypocritical( hypocritical considering her remarks about truly believing in love) job as a dancehall hostess.  In addition to conversely demonstrating the shallow nature of the Broadway musical dream and how even love can seem insincere on a grand lofty scale, they also inject these ideas with quirky humor which distracts from just how insipid these characters would seem if played straight.  The funny thing about this film is that it is both a satire and completely honest in it's depiction of life.  It also contains excellent choreography and music whose flash demonstrates the appeal of such things.  Depicting all of these differing and seemingly contradictory thoughts makes the viewer not know how they feel about the whole thing.  Personally, after the film was over I was left with the callow sense of whimsy and was amazed at how willing I was to be entertained by this.  Apparently the stage version has a different ending so I hope that at some point I'll be able to see it 
 This review is about Disc 2:  I previously owned 1 CD of Seal's and a few CD singles here and there.  I happended to hear the prerelease accoustic version of "Crazy" played on the radio and decided I *had* to have it so I ran out and bought it the day it was released.  I'm so glad I did.  This is a MUST HAVE for any fan of Seal's.  From start to finish every song is perfection except that I found the accoustic version of "Don't Cry" to be a bit slow and swingy.  It doesn't take anything away from the CD though.  Seal is in solid voice throughout and the songs are intensive, reflective, emotional and very well put together.  I play it over and over.  As for Disc 2: I enjoyed this one as well.  This disc contains the full versions of his songs, no radio edits as far as I can see.  I had the chance to discover some other brilliant songs of his that I'm not as familiar with or have never heard before which was great.  If you are not as familiar with all of Seal's work then this is a great way to be introduced to more without having to buy every CD he's got.  If you own every single CD Seal has ever made then Disc 1 won't add anything new to your life apart from having a concentrated collection of some of his best to take with you when you travel or to stick in the CD player when guests are over.  BUY IT FOR DISC 2 - YOU WON'T BE SORRY!! 
 Robert Blees, who wrote this masterpiece of kitsch, had the strangest career.  He was responsible for the screenplays of some of Universal's biggest hits (and biggest duds) and he did wonderful work for Douglas Sirk, including writing THE MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION and ALL I DESIRE.  Among his strengths was an ability to write for women, both veterans and newcomers, in a way that showcased their greatest talents.  Thus, the "aunt" played by Mamie Van Doren in HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL proves to be the best part of the film.  (Blees also wrote AUTUMM LEAVES as a vehicle for Joan Crawford, and gave the young Tuesday Weld a helping hand by showcasing her in his TV version of BUS STOP--where she sings the old standard "Temptation" in an amazing sequence).  He worked for years on a screen version of Tappan's fantasy masterpiece ISLANDIA that, alas, came to nothing.  But it is for films like HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL that he is best known today--lurid, over-the-top potboilers sizzling with kitsch and bad taste, probing into the sick underbelly of American society.  Rather late for noir, Blees' later films are doing their best to invent a category all their own.  Between this and the similarly unconventional SCREAMING MIMI, with Anita Ekberg, there was nothing really left for Quentin Tarantino to do.  And then there was WHO SLEW AUNTIE ROO . . . DR PHIBES RISES AGAIN . . .  Insane 
 An engaging, informative narrative, offering a fuller view of American history than most of us received in school.  I especially enjoyed the convience of listening to it in my car this summer on audio 
 Flying frogs having fun.  We all enjoy it.  Hardly any words, but the incredible art jump starts imagination and sparks long conversations with my boys about what is happening on each page. For ages 3 on up 
 "Dark Tort" is the latest addition in *the* leading culinary mystery series being published today.  The plots are well thought out, the cooking sequences are delightful, and the recipes make for an enjoyable weekend afternoon in the kitchen.  Also, as a native "Coloradoan", hunting for the real-life basis for the various locales Goldy describes adds a nice "side-mystery" to enjoy!  I highly recommend this and the other Goldy Bear culinary mystery books. 
 Excellent movie! Great sound effects! Depth charges shook my room. If you want a good movie to show off your audio gear, this will do it 
 Abouth the King Ben Nawah CD. As a record collector. I must admit I've never before heard the name King Bennie Nawahi, BUT NOW I REALLY HAVE!. Of all the five stars avaiable, I would give this one six ... It proves once again that in the jazz and western swing area of the 20's and 30's you hardly can go wrong at all. I recomend this to guitar lovers everywhere, a real kicker  
 i've read this book to second graders for years. every year, with every new group of students, the suspense about the ending- will sylvester ever become himself again?- hooks everybody in.. 
 I can easily see why Look Homeward, Angel is an American classic.    The story is rambling and diverse, with a host of characters who are strong-willed and self-assured yet deeply flawed.  This strongly reflects the character of the American people, as well as the nation itself.  But the strength of Look Homeward Angel is in the prose.  Wolfe's writing brings to light those passing moments in time that stay with us forever but which we don't recognize at the time as significant - the glory of the air in an early spring morning, the sensual stimuli that are all around us walking down a dark street late at night, and many other unforgetable scenes.  His writing has the power and vitality of Faulkner, without the sometimes impossible sentences that cause one to lose track.  It is challenging and rich.  Look Homeward, Angel is a masterpiece of place, time, and style.  
 The text in the book is very sweet.  However, the best part about this book are the pictures.  They are very vibrant and extremely beautiful.  I read it to my class and they really enjoyed it 
 I am slowly moving through this tome, enjoying every moment spent there. This text, now in 2nd edition (2004), is an excellent overview of many psychological aspects of the human mind. It is clearly written. Articles pertaining to scientific studies of the mind, and psychology of human behavior, are thoroughly researched; helpful bibliographies provide a stimulus to "dig deeper." This book deserves a place next to other psych-related texts in your personal library 
 This fragrance makes people ask you, what is that fragrance you're wearing?  I had never heard of it before, but now it's my favorite.  Great job offering great prices on extraordinary products 
 this is one of the best books i have ever read. slam is a great book too. this book takes us through lonnie's life in highschool and all his problems. dean meyers makes all of lonnies problems seem very realistic. cal, the head coach of lonnies team has a very interseting story to his life too. this book is great for anyone who loves basketball or anyone who loves sports and excitement. actually this book is just for anyone who wants to read a good book. 
 This book is both an indepth study into the Imperial Family as it is Anna Anderson. Lovell is of course like all authors baised, but he does a good job presenting evidence for Anna Anderson being Anastasia.   This book came out before the DNA tests, and actually raises some questions that have not been answered by the DNA tests.  Additionally the Fifth Daughter story, is only a theory, one which even Lovell did not claim was true or false, but rather bizarre.   If your looking for a bibliography of other Romanov books to read on the subject, this book has it. It will also give you information that you never knew before.  Additionally Lovell is Anna Anderson's official biographer.   A Must read 
 This great book is being recorded by Derek Warren as a freely (thanks to Creative Commons licenses) downloadable audio book from Macintosh Folklore Radio at folklore.trideja.co 
 This short, fun book filled with lovely inspirational words and photos can bring a smile to anyone's face.  You'll find yourself re-reading pages to reminder you of all the little things that can make us really happy.

 I have region 1 and region 4 editions of this excellent film on DVD (widescreen Anniversary Editions).  If your player is compatible, buy the region 4 edition.  This plays slightly more quickly (?!) than the region 1 edition: the result is a 10-minute shorter film, with a noticeable increase in the crispness of the dialogue and music.  Also, the region 1 edition suffers from up-and-down volume fluctuations in the dramatic strap-down sequence.  The region 4 edition does not; its music is uniform and superb 
 I love my curiosity Mogu pillow, its very comfortable to sleep with and it is very cute. A must buy for anyone who ever likes Mogu in the slightest. 
 This book edited by Ron Enroth is a good basic overview of religions commonly referred to by evangelical Christians as "cults."  Rather than use this term, however, as the title declares, it uses the term "New Religious Movements."  This is a more recent term which does not carry with it the negative connotation as does the word cult.  (As an aside, however, this term itself can be quite ambiguous.)  The chapters are written by leading authors and provide general overviews of the religions discussed.  This work is best suited for those who are getting their first exposure to these groups.  It is not intended for scholarly inquiry.  Consider the book a small dictionary or encylopedia of select religious groups.  The book can be read from cover to cover or referred to when seeking information about a specific group.  The first chapter (written by editor Enroth) defines the term New Religious Movements.  Chapters two through ten summarize the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, Yoga and Hinduism, Unification Church, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Astral Religion and the New Age, the Dali Lama and Tibetan Buddhism, Neopaganism, the Baha'i World Faith, and the Nation of Islam (in that order).  There is no template the authors follow, allowing them to use their own method in their chapters.  Some offer overt Christian/biblical responses to the faith they describe; others do not.  Yet it is clear that the work is designed to introduce these groups to Christians.  And inclusion of a group in the book necesarily implies that said group would be considered objectionable to Christians.  The last chapter is titled "Evaluating New Religious Movements."  A three-pronged approach is followed. Using the Apostle's Creed as the standard statement of orthodox Christian belief, LaVonne Neff, first, instructs readers on how to identify a group as lying outside traditional Christian parameters (recognizing that not all the religions discussed have necessarily diverged from Christianity but nonetheless present some challenge to Christian teaching).  Second, Neff, instructs readers to evaluate groups on the basis of how it treats its members.  He offers a list of questions to ask a group/religion in carrying out such an assessment.  Third, Neff, offers four ways in which New Religious Movements can help the church. To be sure, he does not mean that these groups can teach the church theology, for that is the primary point of contention between traditional Christianity and the New Religious Movements. Rather, his comments suggest that these groups call Christians/Christianity to instrospection and renewed concern for others.  Again, this book is geared to the novice and can be a good first look.  One would want to springboard from this work to other more indepth works for further information 
 As a testament to my ignorance, I picked up this book without knowing who the author was. I learned pretty quickly about Jack Welch and his time as an engineer, manager, and then CEO of General Electric.  Kudos to Welch for having realized that those companies that do not adapt to new business realities are doomed, first to non-performance, and then to failure. He certainly saved GE, one of America's great companies, from stagnation if not death. He realized GE would have to expand its business to sectors outside of GE's previous operations, and maybe even scale back or sell off the traditional businesses. Many people criticized him for this. Today, those same people worship him. My company now uses software developed by GE for our day to day operations. In previous decades, most people knew they only made refrigerators and light bulbs.  Welch was also criticized for liberally firing people. So many people lost their jobs when GE took over certain companies that he was called `Neutron Jack'. I feel for those people, but Welch calls the firings necessary. Welch also let many non-performing managers go. I don't feel for these people. I wish my company did the same thing. I am tired of having to pick up slack for non-performers.  A frown to Welch for one thing: resisting the government mandated clean up of the Hudson River. Welch was furious at an employee for having admitted that the company was responsible for polluting the Hudson River with dioxins. He should have owned up and cleaned it up.  This book is lacking in that it gives only impressions on how to manage a company. Very superficial. But then it doesn't really promise specifics either, and such a book probably would take several more volumes and be boring anyway. There are many useful insights and take-away generalizations that make this book worthwhile 
 We used this book for our book club. It had practical ideas and was the guide for creating a simple information booklet to help parents work with their children. 
 With this collection of interviews, William B. Styple has done a great service to both James E. Kelly, a forgotten artist and avid collector of U.S. historical memories, and today's readers.  It will be interesting to see how modern professional historians of the Civil War, especially of Gettysburg and Lincoln's assassination, judge the notes taken by Kelly from his conversations with many of the main players of the era.  A book that will be enjoyed by anyone with a keen interest in mid-19th century America 
 Linda Goodman keeps it real, understanding that nothing is definate and everything changes. The reason I love astrology is because I feel it helps me deal with the sometimes social awkwardness of life -- and Linda Goodman's books are very detailed.  You should also try SUN SIGNS by LINDA GOODMAN, it's like this book, but has nothing to do with love.   love her 
 Why Men Earn More is another well researched thoughtful book from this author.  Once again, Dr. Farrell examines issues that the gender feminists would prefer are left solely in their domain.  No doubt his research and analysis will be attacked as flawed by his feminist detractors.   This book makes one think and not only question our assumptions, but the myths promoted by modern feminism. Once the myth and misinformation is questioned, it becomes obvious that on average, women make very different choices compared to men when it comes to earning a living. We are free to make these choices and we do. Not the least of which is to depend on men, to varying degrees, for our income.   Not withstanding that the modern gender equality debate, largely dominated by women and now in its fifth decade, feminists are still frustrated by women's choices.   To blame the other gender for these choices is intellectually dishonest and this is what Dr. Farrell is addressing in Why Men Earn More.  There is no gender based barrier to employment and education for women.    Two difficulties I encountered in attaining my law degree was being able to afford to pay for the education and doing the hard work required to succeed.  These are the very same challenges my male classmates faced.  I did what was needed and I got my degree.  But, I had to make sacrifices.  This is something modern feminism does seem to want to acknowledge.  Making choices inherently involves forgoing other options.  This is precisely what Why Men Earn More addresses.  If mainstream feminism had the maturity to accept this fact of life instead of blaming men for women's choices, there would be no need for Dr. Farrell's book and his advice to women on how to succeed financially in life rather then simply marrying up.  Face it ladies, many of us still think there is some form of entitlement in being female.  Many of us have not taken advantage of the rights and opportunities so many have fought to gain for women.  Yes this is frustrating, but to blame male discrimination for women's choices in light of today's reality is patently false and, in fact, intellectually dishonest.  Why Men Earn More is a must read for any woman that wants to have a successful career and is willing to accept the responsibility of real gender equality. 
 I really enjoyed this book. This is a memoir, not a novel, which explains why reading it felt like reading a journal. I loved Carole's style of writing and the way she portrayed things. I think she wanted this to be just a story of friends, and not focus on WHO the friends were. I think she accomplished this. It did not feel like just another book about the Kennedy family. Even though I knew how the book would end, I cried. It was written so beautifully. 
 I love "Riverdance".  I can listen to it or watch it over and over and still be charmed out of my wits.  It is an excellent escape to another world, albeit for a too short period of time.  For more charming Irish music - see "Ragus" and their dance music as well 
 This is a fantastic book for Middle School or High School soil study!  It is hillarious.   The captions are for the older student, but still absolutely fitting 
 This book is wonderful introduction to Japanese history.  It covers Japan  from the earliest sources through the late Tokugawa Shogunate in the 18th  century.  The sources trace political, social, artistic, philosophic, and  religious trends throughout Japanese history, in the words of the Japanese  of those former periods.  Selections from all the important source material  for Japanese history are assembled in this book 
 This is a fantastic book on palmistry and hand reading. Loads of great pictures and interesting text make it fun and easy to use. If you are even mildly interested in palmistry, definitely check this book out. It's also great to take to parties and family gatherings- people have a good time reading hands, and it's so clearly laid out that everyone can understand and enjoy. Highly recommended 
 I was yesterday in a Jungian workshop when suddenly there was this man who began to tell us a story. I felt like I child listening to the storyteller  of the tribe. He was Gerald, and his story of the arrow from the sun.I love  the story and this worderful person with his own myth behind the books 
 Loren, in his own challenging way, hits us were it hurts concerning our finances. If you want to know how you can be financially active for the Lord then read this book - You will never be the same again. Many of the illustrations are from Loren's own life which make it even more special and real. For myself as a missionary I was challenged about my own giving and also encouraged about going out to live on faith. God asks for our lives, our money is part of that - read and be challenged. Thanks Loren for a wonderful book indeed 
 "Memento" eclipses everything which preceded it, and set the bar so high it may never be topped.  And all for $5 million in production costs. Director Nolan does a remarkable job of juggling the complex plot elements, but sabotages himself with some of his rather ordinary visual schemes.  I refer you to the diner sequence in which characters portrayed by Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano converse over soup.  Given that the film was shot in Panavision's 2.35:1 anamorphic process, the scene would have played more effectively if Nolan had simply planted his camera for a medium shot of two skillful actors as they provided plot exposition.  Instead, Nolan intercuts between close ups of the two, which is a method more typical of and appropriate for the narrower aspect ratio of television.  Close ups work best when used judiciously and to provide emphasis.   I mention this only because this is how detailed I have to go in order to find fault with the film.  If I didn't know better I would swear that Pearce is an American actor--his accent is that authentic.  All of the performances are convincing and it's always fun to see "Eve 6" (Harriet Sansom Harris) from that great "X-Files" episode.   This film is proof of the morally bankrupt notion that movies have to cost $200 miilion or more.  I am SICK of ugly, witless, loud blockbusters which are polluting pop culture.  If the choice is to spend that sort of money making a movie...or allow the movie to go unmade... "Now, where was I? 
 That magicul book seld my fingers on the cover! When I opened the adventures book I felt excited. In scool when I had to write about the book I rememberd the magicul trips they took 
 This is by far my favorite Bob Dylan CD (with The Times They Are A-Changin' a close second).  As you can probably tell, I am more into the folky Bob Dylan, where his poetic imagery shines throughout with a perfect mix of acoustic guitar and harmonica adding to his sound.  Don't get me wrong, I like electric Dylan, just not as much.  When you look at the song titles from this album, you realize how many truly great songs he put out on this record.  My favorites are "Blowing In The Wind" (maybe one of my favorite songs of all time!), "Girl Of The North Country" (amazing!), "Masters of War," "Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" (influenced by a poem), "Don't Think Twice It's Alright" (beautiful picking!), and the laugh-out-loud funny "I Shall Be Free."  As a 24 year old, I am WAY too young to fully appreciate Dylan when he came out (as I wasn't born), but hearing it now, he is still relevant.  He sings with such honesty that you can feel what he is singing, even though what he was singing/protesting about was decades ago.  This is a great Dylan album to start with if you do not have any of his albums and you don't want to get a greatest hits record.  This is pure folk at its best and not many albums can match it 
 This album covers some of the best cuts that Annette every recorded.  Tommy Dorsey once called Annette, the musicians singer.  She could sing and carry her voice like an instrument and would let each musician have his  part in the song.  What makes her songs such perennial favorites is that  listeners love to identify each of the great jazz musicians that accompany  her on these records.  You can hear Eddie Lang, Joe Venuti, Red Nichols,  and the Dorsey Brothers all contributing to her ensembles.  Each of these  cuts identifies a differnent attribute that she could convey.  She could  mimic ala Betty Boop or sing a strong romantic ballad.  Sometimes she just  loved to play with the musicians and remind them to not take themselves  quite so seriously.  Yes, have a listen.  Annette was one of those great  artists that comes along once and while and graces us with her meolodies 
 Easy to use, comfortable stroller but I would say it is better suited for infants, young babies and small toddlers not pre-school age and up because the seat is lower to the ground and very small 
 I have Without a Net and love that, but Live at the Cow Palace is great! Alot of my faves are on here 
 Simply Awesome! I keep having to stop the tape so it can sink in 
 Imagine Jane Austen with a pinch of Harry Potter.  It is witty and has some magic, though mostly it is some wonderful characters interacting, with alot of fun intrigue.  It's the sort of book I wanted to bury myself under an afgahn with, it was just so much fun.  (I've already started reading it a second time while I am waiting to get ahold of the next book).  Its also fun to read as a writer, knowing how the two authors went about writing this.  Perhaps it was where I was reading it ( a loud mall) but certain dramatic moments were slightly confusing to me, the orchestration of various scenes perhaps being not as smoothly written as they could be.  However, the overall effect of the novel is wonderful, a cast of characters emerges that are wonderful to follow the adventures of, each letter brings a new twist. The characters of Kate and Cecy write back and forth so effortlessly, and their male counterparts are very amusing as well.  Anyone who loves Austen and doesn't mind wondering a bit further into the realm of the fantastical, I can't reccomend this book highly enough.  Its probably middle school reading level, but an older audience will also really appreciate it 
 Admittedly, I don't love this as much the original CSI set in Las Vegas, but I don't like CSI New York and don't watch that at all.  I really like this cast (and in the first episode of this season we lose Tim Speedle (who I thought was pretty good in it - maybe a little dull but a nice guy).  That was a sad episode but his replacement Ryan Wolfe (who's so cute) does a good job in filling the void.  He's an ex cop and takes some time fitting in with the team. One thing you'll notice if you watch all three franchises is the colour they use for each show.  I find Miami is the most colourful.  Their lab is sleeker but the outdoor shots are stunning and use vibrant colours - often a lot of yellowy orangey tones (whereas New York is dull and blue and grey and Vegas is somewhere in the middle). There are 24 episodes in this season and I'm always impressed with how they keep it fresh and different.  Someday I'm expecting them to run out of ideas, but in the meantime it's always interesting and really keeps you guessing.  There is a little more personal looks into the lives of the CSI agents which you don't see in Vegas, and it's a nice mix. Overall, this is a great series but I do still prefer the original.  Either way, this is a smart and intelligent show that gets me watching every single week.  I really like it and hope you enjoy it as much as I do 
 Elmer Bernstein's score for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is an innovative and groundbreaking score ringing in a new era not only for the Western film genre but for all film music. Elmer Bernstein's main theme for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN besides being highly recognizable is both rousing and reflective. It is a statement on the nature of bravery and nobility as the seven gunmen go up against innumerable odds for the rights of the downtrodden. The score is pensive yet contains great orchestral movement which not only advances the plot but entices the viewer to become enthralled in the drama. Bernstein infuses both traditional Western and Mexican orchestral flavor into the score, yet rearranges these styles to deliver the adventure and human drama of the tale. However, most importantly Bernstein asks the viewer by the film's finale to fathom the enigma of bravery and self-sacrifice of these seven noble gunmen. This recording is one of a handful of soundtracks that should be classified as essential 
 great in the early-middle section, but dragged a bit towards the end 
 I reeeeally enjoyed this book. Its straightforward talk made it easy to read. Being a women, I read the parts to women, and it really provided some insight to what men expect in the relationship, and how men view themselves. It seems like it is the christian version of Men are from Mars, and Women are from Venus. Each chapter covers areas where I or I have had friend stumble in their relationship with their spouse. The chapter that stayed with me the most is about sex and intimacy. Also the bulleted points really provided practical information to help apply the information provided. More important, the topics were discussed from a christian prespective without an overbearing religious tone. I suggested it to any couple to to read or any single person who is desiring marriage. Also I would suggest it to a divorce person as well. 
 ...combines reviews. One person reviews the CD version of the book, while another reviews a modern interpretation of the middle english. I am here to review the book at hand, which is "Canterbury Tales" by Geoffrey Chaucer, published by Everyman's library.  First off, the book is complete, and rendered in middle English, so it is not for the faint of heart. Notes are given in the margins, although these generally seem useless (if you read the book aloud, you will understand most of the phrases they "translate", even though your eyes won't believe what your mouth just spoke). Of far greater value are the footnotes to many of the lines, which render in a modern sense some of the more obscure greetings, curses, idioms, etc. the reader is likely to find. Unfortunately, looking down at the footnotes will break your rhythm, and it can be difficult to find your place again, with so many unfamiliar words staring at you. I wish the editors(presenters?) would have put THESE footnotes in the margins, instead of the simpler fare found there (however, I understand that some people may not read the book as easily as I did).  The work itself seems complete, however, although I am no scholar of Chaucer. Even the Parson's Tale is found here (it is deleted in many works, since it is little more than a maudlin sermon), although I would skip it if I were you. The poetry is incredibly pleasing to the ear, if offensive to the eye; I cannot stress enough that one should read the book aloud to hear its greatness.  I won't review the work, since I feel I have no right to criticise Chaucer. However, the presentation here is good, with the exception of the footnote problem. While this edition is not for the faint of heart (it takes real work to read), I would recommend it to anyone who wants to actually hear the words Chaucer heard in his own head as he wrote this 
 Dr. Huntington's book caused alot of upheaval in academia because it dared to say what others will not out of fear of disrupting the multicultural establishment. This book asked the difficult questions which demand honest debate and tough answers. I would encourage anyone to read this who is interested in the cultural transformation our nation has undergone over the past fourty years and where we are heading. talkwiseblo 
   I once had this friend in high school, Suzy.  She was the quiet little queen bee of ninth grade.  Her parents had no idea that she snuck out of their home every night and returned every morning with her tousled, perfect curls still in order, undetected.  Eventually her father discovered these midnight trysts and punished her by taking away her makeup for a week. I guess when you are living in a stale household, you are beautiful (and know it), and in need of some stimulation, you can always use your beauty as a weapon - just don't get caught. I loved the Virgin Suicide's character of Lux.  Here is a girl, like "Suzy" who is bored with being gorgeous and decided to use it as a weapon to save herself from her 1970's life of "Not my Girls"- style parenting.  Lux has beautiful sisters as well, but they don't have developed personalities and are more of a character in whole that sympathize with her.  Lux is the queen bee and leader of this family pack of admired beauties. As a young teenager she is discovering the power of her own sexuality.  Her curiosities about boys and the outside world away from her parent-controlled, sterile environment lead her to rebellious behavior and experimentation with the opposite sex.  Lux is one of Sofia Coppola's more shallow female creatures discovering the thrills of her own charms.  She is reminiscent of Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" in her young innocence and ability to indulge in the occasional lack of constant supervision.  Lux and her sisters are desperate for some kind of change, a catalyst, someone to rescue them from their lives after losing one sister to suicide.  They are in dire need of escape before they lose themselves in an ordinary life.  I highly recommend this movie and also suggest: the new "Marie Antoinette" if you are interested in Sofia's continued progress on the exploitation of young , sexually blooming teenage minds allowed to run wild with self-abandon.  It's easy to see Sofia's point when watching both films back to back - Dunst, as Lux or Marie Antoinette is still the same teenager-they are still using their young powers of seduction to tantalize and get what they want.  One happens to be the queen bee of her high school, the other the queen of France - nonetheless, the same desperate girl in need of affection and attention.   
 Steven Van Yoder has done a superb job of gathering a wide range of approaches people have taken to become slightly famous. His compilation of stories provides something for everyone as the reader contemplates the best approach for themselves. The book is an easy and inspiring read 
 A small book for young children containing of four stories told in illustrated panels in which the stories are all interlocked into one set. Beautifully prepared, it was awarded the 1991 Caldecott Medal for best  illustrations in a book for children. Children should enjoy this book time  and time again 
 WOW. So much for so little and in such a little compact book is amazing.  Perfect for a newbie looking to get into Administration of windows 2000 servers or a seasoned MCSE that needs refresher. Excellent book 
 It's a tragedy that when an adopted person speaks, so many people insist he is wrong - even when he is recounting his own experiences.  Thanks to Mr. Green people may now obtain a better understanding of what it is like for a human being to be separated from mother in infancy and grow up in an environment devoid of any true family members. This is very timely information with all the infertility businesses pushing sperm "donation", embryo donation, egg "donation" and surrogacy.   And sadly, there is a continued push to get newborn babies for adoption customers, babies from naive and pressured parents and families that have never been proven to be unfit in any way.       
 I removed links from my new Seiko band. No problem. I can see how a doofus might need the extra parts, while they are learning the proper technique. Press down FIRMLY on the band with your thumb to prevent it from moving while you turn the knob with your other hand. The base under the band is spring-loaded with a Strong spring. If you allow the band to move while you are pushing the pin out, you may break off the part that's doing the pushing. Get the band and pin lined up exactly before proceeding - or - you may break the little pusher part. Good Luck - it's a good tool. 
 One of the sure fire ways to judge a so-called 'punk' record from the late 70's/early 80's is staying power - does it sound dated & stale?  Does it still have appeal & relevance, both lyrically and musically?  In my opinion there are many releases from the UK in the late 70's that of stood the test of time; London Calling, Setting Sons, Machine Gun Etiquette, Rattus Norvegicus, Never Mind the Bollocks, etc.  This is one for the ages, GOF never reached the summit again, this was their debut and clearly the finest release in their up & down career.  All the right ingredients crystallize, pungent biting lyrics with acute social commentary (that ironically still apply today) incredible muscianship, uptempos, clever vocal wordplay, it's all here, obviously, this is one of the greatest albums ever made.  I've owned it for 20+ years and still slap the vinyl on at least when I need to feel charged up about something that sticks in my craw. Indispensable. (Essence Rare & Damaged Goods will have you boppin')     
 This book will astonish you even before you open it. The jacket has the images of two of the most iconic superheroes of DC, Superman and Batman, and below the jacket you'll find an unbelievable piece of art showing almost every DC superhero battling versus their respective villains.  With an introduction from M Night Shyamalan, the book presents Alex from his early beginnings as a child trying to create comic book characters and how his mother kind of influenced him (even though he affirms this didn't happen, take a look at her mom's works and try to believe him)  He then presents the DC characters one by one (the Batman session has some pages dedicated to the Joker only, no other villains are shown), the early drawings, original artwork from classics and the homage he has paid for covers, posters or special editions. Analysis on the symbols and the myths of each character are used to describe what Ross wants to project with his images. I don't think it necessary to mention which character has the larger amount of pages dedicated to himself only. You get to see in drawings the creative process he follows when creating a piece, the ideas scratched on a piece of paper, the drawings and possible posing and then the final image. There are pictures I has never seen until I got this book, when I first saw them my fisrt thought was ` I need to frame these', which came up as a bad idea as I would have had to frame the entire book.  The abandoned ideas for `Portraits of villainy' are presented here in the form of pencil sketches that look pretty well, it is hard to imagine how they would have looked if the project had been completed. His takes on Hanna-Barbera, Mad magazine, Alan Moore, the animated style and World's finest are also present.  Then there are pages and pages dedicated to 'Kingdom Come', from the early concepts and ideas, passing through sketches until the realization of the project. The possible prequel that never occurred, `The Kingdom' is also mentioned and the preliminary sketches by Ross are shown.  Uncle Sam is also analyzed  near the end of the book in the same way the other projects previously were.  Then we have this section called `The process', in which we obviously get to see how Alex works using the book's cover as example. The final part of the book is a very nice bonus, a Batman/Superman special story written by Chip Kidd and Alex Ross created exclusively for this book.  Indeed a great piece of collection, this book is a must for comic book fans. The hard cover presentation, the paper in which it is printed and the bonus stuff are worth the price to pay. 
 Everybody loves this album; why else would you have clicked on the icon in order to view the product?  Everybody knows that the album has been re-sequenced in order to comply with Bradly Nowell's original sequence.  I have listened to this album for so long, that it will take a while to RE-ADJUST to the new sequence of the songs!   Also, everybody knows that this album comes with a supplimental disc with extra goodies!  The second disc contains several priceless songs- especially the accoustic material which has been included.  In my OPINION, the accoustic tracks make the second disc the gem of the whole collection.  This release is a no-brainer for the fans 
 This novel was amazing.  It is just as good as Jurassic Park and I recommend it to anyone who loved Jurassic Park.  This novel is much better than the movie so if you liked Lost World, then you should definitely read this.  Crichton realistially extends this series and keeps you entertained throughout the book.  Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down 
 What I wouldn't give to be invited to Laura Calder's house for a meal.  If she is delightful in person as she is in print, I would be in for a real treat.  French Food At Home has turned me into a fan of French cooking -- at least the way Laura does it.  Who ever would have thought that these simple recipes could yield such succulent results?!  You know a meal is good when you can't help but smile from its deliciousness in mid bite.  But this is French Food At Home throughout.  I've made the Pineapple Tuilles, Summer Lentil Salad, Thyme Licks, Leek Tart, Spiced Almonds, Coffee Chop and all were hits. And remember not to skimp on the ingredients as this is key. Buy the freshest that you possibly can, follow Ms. Calder's witty and interesting recipes and enjoy the deliciousness and compliments that are sure to follow.  Bon Appetit 
 consider this fact about the USA - 13 (now  14)have reviewed this  book in this forum - and all have declared that this book, against almost all  other books regarding the environment, and specifically, wildness, comes the closest to expressing their own hearts, if not before reading it, then because of reading it - yet we are force fed through the mass media that americans are gluttonous and rapacious - well as it turns out, no - just a handful are- and that handful has all of the money and all of  the guns.  the landlady, dear readers, IS strangling our cat.  
 Good Book on principles & practices of High Voltage Engineering 
 Among the various writers who I read, Christopher Moore is a relatively recent addition to the list.  My first experience with him - Bloodsucking Fiends - was fun, so I started picking up his other works.  Practical Demonkeeping - my second Moore book - is also a light, entertaining read.  The novel follows Travis O'Hearn who is around a century old but hardly looks twenty.  The secret of his youth seems to be tied to Catch, a demon of immense power and bad attitude.  To some extent, Catch serves Travis, but that doesn't stop the demon from the occasional consumption of a human being; Travis is at least able to keep Catch's diet limited to criminals, but can do little more to control the demon's appetites.  Both wouldn't mind getting rid of the other, but they are bound together by a magic link that neither can sever called the Seal of Solomon.  Meanwhile, in Pine Cove, California (where Travis and Catch are heading), respected town elder Augustus Brine is visited by the djinn Gian Hen Gian, who happens to Catch's adversary.  With relatively little ability to directly combat Catch, Gian has recruited Brine.  The bulk of the novel - which takes place over one weekend - deals with Catch's efforts to create havoc and the often unlinked efforts of Travis and Augustus to contain him.    Moore mixes in a lot of humor in his story, but he retains enough seriousness to create a decent amount of suspense (even if the light touch does seem to promise things will turn out all right).  Beyond that, Moore's decent knowledge of both mythology and pop culture add a level of depth to this story that might not be expected...it may not actually be a deep story, but it isn't exactly shallow either.  What Practical Demonkeeping is is offbeat.  This is not a case of the same-old story of the supernatural, just as Bloodsucking Fiends went beyond the standard vampire cliches.  It's not War and Peace, but it doesn't need to be to be a top-notch piece of entertainment.  
 Now that I've finished Monk's Hood, I have found a new appreciation for Ellis Peters' work.  After one death too many, I was expecting a rather static setting that would seem to change, but in truth, it would really change from book to book.  I am definitely the product of watching too many American sitcoms and am glad my expectation was not met.  The story begins with Father Abbot Heribert leaving Shrewsbury to a council being held to reassess the leadership of the Church in England.  He believes is going to be replaced so he leaves any legal matters unsigned so the new Abbot could determine the course of things once appointed.  In the meantime, the Bonel household was going to cede its holdings to the abbey in exchange for a quiet retirement.  The contract was left unsigned by the Abbot and shortly after Gervase Bonel, the head of the household, was murdered by way of poison, a medicine called Monk's Hook made by Cadfael himself.    The book is filled with a wonderful assortment of characters.  None of which are good or bad.  They have their own strengths, aspirations and failings.  Once of things I enjoy about the Cadfael stories is he passes very little judgment against others (Brother Jerome and Prior Robert being exceptions).  We have a new assistant - Brother Mark, his former fiancé - Richaldis, the return of Hugh Beringer, not to mention a number others.  Even the murderer in the end is a many Cadfael felt sympathy for and helps.  Yes, there is a sense of right and wrong in these books, but the means to right are often rather unorthodox and thus enjoyable.  I would recommend this book to anyone continuing to read the stories of Cadfael.  They would appeal to a mystery reader and perhaps a fantasy reader as well.  Definitely someone who likes historical fiction.  I know I am well hooked into the series now 
 I love this book! Keith is an awsome motivational speaker.  I have never finished reading a book so fast.  It will help anyone who is needing a new start on life. You might just see that the one person holding you back it you.  Thank you to Keith for writing this book. : 
 A fascinating read that is well researched. If you have ever been associated with the U.S. submarine force or are generally intrigued by real-life espionage you will not want to miss this book. 
 I bought this book along with Baby Blender Food,  and I really like this one the best.  It has practical information  RE: safe food handling, the meaning behind nutritional and organic terms on product packaging, suggestions for stocking your pantry, and ideas about how to incorporate meals for the family from  the recipes for the baby.  It's not rocket science,  but sometimes I get caught up in the baby food process and don't think about how to modify some of the ingredients for my own meal.  She also has a helpful key that lists vegetarian,  vegan, gluten-free recipe options.  The recipes are pretty simple,  and I've found that it's easy and fun  to make food for my son.  It also feels really good to know exactly what's going into his food.  I like the layout of the book,  and I appreciate the information in it.   Another review mentioned that she doesn't outline food hazards like nitrates in the body of the recipes, but if you read the book from  the beginning,  she has pretty comprehensive explanations of what is safe to prepare and when it's safe to prepare it 
 I laughed more while reading this book than I have in a long time, and I got some much appreciated background on some of Atlas's fighters too. Its rare to find a boxing book that's enjoyable even for non-boxers, but I think this would be one  Well worth a loo 
 You can read Flannery over and over again and always come away with something new and never, ever get bored. Much like listening to Beethoven, Mozart, or the Beatles, O'Connor never, ever gets old or wearing. My god, what a gift she had. Other reviewers have summarized the stories, so I won't. Suffice it to say, this collection should be on all people's bookshelves that love literature 
 In 1984, a new group burst on the scene with a new sound in pop/dance music - Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, The Pet Shop Boys! Bringing out such tunes as West End Girls, It's A Sin and Jealousy, they were a hit. Now, they might be off of the Top 40 charts, but they are still around.  However, if you remember their glory days, and want to recapture that great Pet Shop Boys Sound, then this is the album to get. It has 18 of the groups greatest hits, including my personal favorites, It's A Sin, Rent, Always On My Mind and Jealousy. I love this CD, and am very glad that I was given it as a gift. This is a great CD that I highly recommend to all fans of good pop/club music 
 This book is an essential for any southern gardener.  I have not been gardening in the South for very long, and I find the information here crucial to avoid making costly mistakes that I see other gardeners making.  I guess they don't own this book 
 Here Wilson elaborates on Timothy Leary's eight-circuit model of human consciousness.  This is stimulating reading for those who haven't been exposed to the concepts before; maybe like beating a dead horse for those who have.  Not as enjoyable as some of Wilson's other work, but still well worth the read 
 Are you a lovelorn twenty-something with reams of poetry slowly mouldering in the drawers of your bedroom dresser? An idealistic humanist who prefers the charities listed on U2's latest album liner to the record packaged with them? An English professor? A cynic who still craves Romantic poetry? A decadent nihilist waking from the latest in a long line of hopeless one-night-stands? A fan of Wes Anderson movies? The Smiths? The Beatles (circa 1965-1969)? Or just someone who melts in the face of beautiful music, regardless of its style or source?  If you can answer yes to any of those questions, "If You're Feeling Sinister" might just hit you like the Revelation of St. John. These songs come from a gushing source of the internal commotion locked in the heads of young people. The subjects of these vignettes range from pre-suicidal portraits ("If You're Feeling Sinister") to the exploits of a social-climbing high-school lothario and the recipients of the serial sexual awakenings he offers ("Stars of Track and Field") to the tension resulting from everyday momentary encounters between a fey young man and his conservative neighbor ("Me and the Major"). Although the lyrics are not worthy of Baudelaire or Byron, they include rich imagery, realistic psychological portraits, strong narrative structures, and delicious non-sequiters such as "...your terry underwear;/ You feel the city air run past your body," and "She was into S&M and Bible studies,/ not everyone's cup of tea, she would admit to me." All of this is set to luxuriant and memorable melodies and stirring instrumentation whose richness redeems by far the album's low-cost production. Plus, "Judy and the Dream of Horses" is one of the catchiest, prettiest, most bouyant songs ever recorded.  This album has a history of being regarded by fans as a rare treasure that should be kept close and adulated; many have become obsessed or at least infatuated with Belle and Sebastian because of this record. It is such a treasure. Listen, and cherish away 
 This is a very practical and sensibly written book that touches on every  aspect of  Aromatherapy and leaves you with a clear understanding of  essential oils without getting too lengthy or technical. Occassional  anecdotes make reading this book more interesting and the many charts make  things easy at a glance. This is a great book for beginners and the more  experienced as well 
 After being loaned this book for summer reading, I went back and bought my own copy. The story isn't quite what I expected, but I found I couldn't but it down.   The summary for the book is simple. Veterinarian Frannie crosses paths with a young girl named Max. But Max isn't any ordinary little girl. She has wings. And she can fly. And she's on the run, and you know that Frannie is going to end up getting involved.  This novel will answer the how and why that most readers will have. While I think at times events that take place are a little far-fetched or unrealistic, the events that happen will keep you sucked in, and you'll want to know more and more as you read. There's a certain science-fiction element through such ideas as genetic-engineering.   Anything told through Frannie's point of view, is at least to my memory, told in first person. Anything through Max, Kit's, or any other character's point of view is third person limited. This point of view I think works well for the type of story being told. First person makes things awkward.   You'll find yourself wanting to read more and more about Max and where she comes from, and the people around her. I can't say much without spoiling it, but Max and her friends are my favorite characters.  Yet at certain times, I felt a little overwhelmed by the underlying, you know it's going to happen, romance between Kit and Frannie. I don't know how such committed and powerful relationships develop in dire circumstances, but you can bet they always do.   There's lots of drama and action, so you certainly won't get bored reading this book. It will also have you thinking. Overall, it's definately a good read. 
 Talyn is a novel that will haunt me long after I've finished it.  It contains all the right elements of a fully engrossing read: excellent world-building, vivacious characterizations, and a well-paced, complex plot.  The novel's world is vivid and finely developed.  There are no medieval European cliches here; Korre is a world very much of its own and unlike anything I've read before.  Talyn's love of her homeland enriched the descriptions that may have been bland and overkill if told in third person.  Instead, they are fully immersive.  Talyn's narration is poignant and engaging.  The scenes in third person add much to the story, as well.  It was sometimes jarring switching between the two, but such changes were infrequent enough that they did not become distracting.  The characters were vivid and finely developed, especially the villain, who was sympathetic enough to be very frightening.  Talyn is a very well-plotted novel that keeps growing on itself as conflicts get bigger and more complex.  The novel is not without its share of plot twists and surprises.  In all, Talyn is epic fantasy at its finest 
 This book, after i found it randomly in my school library, soon became my favorite book.  I can make many connections with this book to my life.  I love how Lupica describes the characters so vividly that i can picture them in my head perfectly.  I highly suggest that if you like this book as much as i do, then i reccomend reading Heat,also by Mike Lupica.  All in all, this was a great book, so enjoy reading 
 What if you could take a pill or otherwise ingest some substance that would make you see your whole world totally differently than you have seen it before? How do you think your life would change, or would you be any different at all?  As we all know, even if we weren't there...this is a large part of what the 1960's were about. And this book provides a window into the web of events and players that emerged during that turbulent time in our evolution. In my view, it presents an unbiased social history of consciousness expanding chemistry and it's consequences on the human mind and by extension, upon the greater society as a whole. The author uses scenes that are vivid and intimate into the players that had major roles in this upheaval of the status qou - Tim Leary, Allen Ginsberg, Richard Alpert(aka. Ram Dass), Jack Kerouac, Ken Kesey, Aldous Huxley, to name just a few. And of course, they all had their own opinions on how the revolution was to proceed, with frequent disagreements. There is also considerable light shed on the fact that LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, and other compounds were being used with considerable effectiveness within parts of the psychoanalytic community for several years before the powers that be came in and put them back in the box. But even if they hadn't passed laws against these tools, it would have eventually come crashing down of it's own weight. In the end, it was too radical a departure from the societal norms and the movement itself had no real leaders. Leadership was anathema to the revolution, the paradox being that authority was what was being disempowered. The result is that the dream spiraled out of control and we eventually ended up with Ronald Raygun as President and we haven't quite been the same since.  The central question posed by this book seems to be: Who is the ultimate arbiter of what you do with your consciousness? I would suggest that if your answer involves anyone or anything outside your self, then you are not truely free 
 I am thankful that we found this book early enough in my daughter's childhood that we can implement the suggestions and really make a difference in her life.  I have struggled with obesity my entire life, and my daughter appears to have inherited my genetic makeup.  I learned from this book that many of the things my husband and I were doing WERE harming her and setting her up for full-blown obesity in the future.  This book has helped us develop a more relaxed environment around eating, and we now have sit-down family meals for every meal we have at home.  That is a key component of the whole philosophy, and even though we knew that was important in the same way that everyone does, we didn't make it a priority until after reading this book 
 If you find yourself in a 9 to 5 job, feeling safe and comfortable, then this book is for you.  After one hour of reading you will realise that the world of work is changing and how you need to change in order to cope.  If you have always felt inferior about your education or lack of it, then this book is also for you.  It explains that "education is not something you get, but something you take"; that the best education is what you take by yourself; and that today "competence has precedence over credentials".  If you know the world is changing, this book will remind you to always be prepared for change.  One memorable quote from the book is "Always assume you are in the midst of another reorganisation", and something more people are able to identify this.  The book provides seven steps for training yourself and discusses each in a separate chapter.  While the book mainly speaks in general, it provides enough of a starting point for those who are not practicing self-training in preparation for the changes that are happening 
 Siegel's book is considered the one book, next to Graham's Intelligent Investor, that all serious investors need to read and reread. I count myself a very fortunate investor for having changed my life by reading knowledgeable authors and applying what I learned with the same enthusiasm that I devote to Great Literature and Revolutionary Science. 
 I am a parent with a child with CP- This book is GREAT because... 1) It provides a realistic milestone chart- something I've never been able to refer to in other books on child development. 2) It gives great advice no PT ever mentioned. For example, to never put socks on your child. 3) It gives a point-blank explanation of what to do NOW for your child, and to what NOT to wait for. No one ever told me alot of these things Granted, it was depressing at points, but this book sort of slapped me in the face about motor skills. The book talks alot about how time is Not on your child's side, and it motivated me and other caregivers to do MORE INTENSIVE therapy with my girl 
 Wands at the ready! Daniel Radcliffe takes up the role of mysterious boy wizard Harry Potter from J.K. Rowling's epic seven part fantasy series. Fans of all ages have been going crazy ever since they heard that Rowling's popular series was going to be transfigured, so to speak, into a film to be showed on movie screens around the world. Yet what makes this movie so unique is that it was not derived from a modern video game or television series, that the younger generation seems to enjoy, but from an ancient form of entertainment. A book! Just what is the magic that is held within those pages, that seemed to have hooked readers into its compelling storyline around the world?  	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is filled with plenty of excitement. The screenplay is wonderfully interpreted from Rowling's complex storyline that introduces the Harry Potter realm; actors and actresses portray believable, memorable characters, and every scene is filled spectacular special effects. I find it only fair that this movie is truly a piece of magic itself.  	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first in a compelling seven-story adventure where one night living with his aunt and uncle in a somewhat abused life, eleven-year-old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that he is a wizard and gets shipped off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the art of magic. At his arrival he befriends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and the insufferable know it all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and of course there's the deadly enemy the main character always makes, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  Harry Potter is brought about many trials and cloisters in learning the art of magic with his many teachers like Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and "greasy git" Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), all while being praised highly by the greatest wizard in the world, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and taken under the large wing of the half-giant gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). What makes this story more compelling is that Harry Potter himself is a hero, a hero for defeating a dark wizard by the name of Lord Voldemort (craftily done by computer generation). Now Lord Voldemort is after a precious stone that will make him immortal, and Harry and his friends are the only ones who can stop him.  	Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, is filled with action packed scenes that have been digitally enhanced with the wonders of technology from a three-headed dog to a miniature dragon. Some of the best scenes include the Quidditch scene where Harry partakes in his first Quidditch match, the devil's snare scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione find themselves being choked by a plant, and finally the troll scene where Harry and Ron save Hermione from a ghastly looking, mold covered troll. These digital enhancements polish the gems of the movie perfectly and make them shine with outstanding brightness, for they really give the movie that magical aspect.  	The setting is also another strong point found within the movie. Most of the places match the ones described in the book perfectly. They create such a vivid image in the mind, that it almost makes you think that it what you are seeing is real. The Hogwarts castle is depicted almost perfectly with it's towering roofs and warmly lit windows. The corridors are lit with torches and floating candles while the potions classroom looks dark and grimy. The grounds are beautiful, flourishing with a spring of magic. Every aspect was craftily done to make the movie as real to the book as possible.  	The movie also has some shortcomings as well. For it being two and a half hours long, you figure they'd put the important parts in. However, this is not the case. Most of the time, the important parts that lead to the next event were cut out and rearranged to make the story better for a movie audience.  In other aspects of the film, Harry is portrayed unrealistically as a boy wizard who defeated a dark lord at the age of six months is now the greatest wizard of all time? From the moment Harry enters Hogwarts he becomes a hero even though he didn't do anything. For most of Harry's life he didn't even know of his great feat against the dark lord, and within days at Hogwarts he is flaunting his unique lightning bolt scar like he knew that one day he would become a hero.  He then takes on the responsibility of saving the entire school from dark powers without question. I'd expect that an eleven-year-old boy would be scared just like every other young kid who was threatened with death.   	Harry Potter, for all the glory it received, does have some competition. I firmly believe that Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone fell directly between fans of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, both of which came out with their own movie. Firm Christians sought out Narnia, while hardcore fantasy fans fled to Lord of the Rings, leaving Harry Potter in the middle. However there are some hardcore Harry Potter fans as well, but when Rowling's epic story ends, will this brilliant story just fade or fall into the shadows of films that have become classics.  	Even though the movie had both very strong points and it's shortcomings, it was still overall a great film. As the first of an epic seven part series, this movie ends with a happy ending, but a lot of questions unanswered. There can be both a good and bad side to this. Many fans can't stand the waiting for the next film to be produced in a year or so, but if you get them hooked enough, you can guarantee that they'll be back for the next one. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a movie made for family viewing. It depicts the life of a wizard and how he copes with being in a new world. It also firmly implies on the important lessons in courage and loyalty to those you care for. 	 	As of now, there are total of six books and four Harry Potter movies, all of which have hit record amounts. Fans of J.K. Rowling's masterpiece are anxiously awaiting the closure of her series with the final book. I suggest until that happens, fans can occupy themselves with watching the magic of the Harry Potter films and the majestic moral themes they present.   This is a Reveiw by Katelynn Mallon Rabbid Harry Potter fangir 
   What seems at first a man's Svengali-like obsession with a pure young woman and another man's seduction that female proves to be but a part of a clever plot that twists and turns in unexpected ways, producing a darkly gothic ambiance that reeks of menace. At the center of everyone's fascination is the ethereal Effie, a frail girl with streaming white-blonde hair, who becomes the singular model for artist Henry Paul Chester. In the Victorian fashion, Chester makes clear moral distinctions, his life well-ordered and constricted by society's tenets, his considerable dark side kept well-disguised. Many years her senior, Chester marries the unassuming Effie, but struggles to maintain the ideal of purity with his wife, exorcised when she turns to him with passion on their wedding night. Repulsed, Chester believes his wife is tainted, ruined beneath the surface of her innocence. To assuage his own needs, Chester frequents a local bawdy house, where he is consistently drawn to a nubile virgin, Marti, provided by the madam, Fanny Miller.  Determined to maintain the façade he requires for emotional equilibrium, Chester doses his wife liberally with laudanum to assure her compliance with his wishes and shelter her from the outside world. Henry has a showing to introduce his work to the public; into this venue steps a roué, Moses Zachary Harper, who is immediately fascinated by Effie, her shy modesty a drug to his jaded senses. Much to Moses' surprise, his seduction is eagerly embraced, Effie desperate to taste the forbidden fruit he offers, her young life circumscribed by Chester's rigid control. Even Moses is out of his depth, anticipating a short, satisfying dalliance, but pulled into an erotic affair that both exceeds his expectations and frustrates his natural inclination to dominate. Manipulating behind the scenes is Fanny Miller, who has plans of her own for Effie and Moses, among them a long-awaited revenge that will not be denied. Once Effie is introduced to Fannie, the die is cast.  What ensues is a complicated brew of obsession, revenge, guilt and the loss of innocence, all laced with increasing draughts of laudanum and chloral hydrate. While Effie drifts through her days and deceptive nights in a drug-filled fugue, Henry is beset with guilt and increasing paranoia, relieved only by furtive doses of chloral hydrate. Fantasy and reality merge as the final act begins, the tortured souls tearing at one another with artifice and deception. In true gothic fashion, the pages are laced with evil intentions, even Effie unrecognizable in the hands of a master. A pawn to Henry, Moses and Fanny, Effie is the key to all, the coin of a terrible misdeed. Henry, the dark master, is ultimately destroyed by his damaged soul, dissembling to the end to avoid the consequences of his sick and twisted existence. Harris defines the powerful subconscious of her characters, a murky underworld of sexual dysfunction and the callous destruction of a defenseless young woman. In true Victorian fashion, the morality play self-destructs, hurling the protagonists into their just rewards. Luan Gaines/2007.      
 Its a very helpful guide! It helped me get a lot of orbs. You should get it if you have Spyro 2:Ripto's Rage 
 Pygmalion, the romantic comedy written by George Bernard Shaw, shows people the various social roles and obstacles that existed in London in the early 1900's.  The story unfolds with Mr. Higgins, a cunning linguist, who places a bet with his fellow comrade, Colonel Pickering, saying he would be able to transform Eliza Doolittle, a cockney speaking, street vending peasant, into a respectable young lady, fit to attend an ambassador's party and not be noticed as a person of a lower class. Eliza, personally willing to take the challenge on for her own benefit, works with Higgins over a number of weeks and is ultimately able to drop her accent and speak like a upper-class English lady.   This story illustrates that though there is a social hierarchy in London at the time, those with the ambition and tenacity to jump social stratas have the opportunities and are able to succeed in doing so.  Once in this position however, some tend to question their place in this class and whether they fit in with the mainstream doings that are found with that status.  With confidence and support, Eliza's role shows that there is indeed room to grow, learn, and adapt to a new culture.  I think this play is a great read today because it still relates to our society on a whole. People find even now, the unfortunate settings up of a class system within North America. It's easy to relate, though the reader may not be the flower seller in the street, they may be the immigrant learning to speak English to gain a job and financial security for example. The role of class structures made this play relevant in reading it in the past, at the present moment, and will continue to make it worth reading in the future.  
 "Play" was my first introduction to Moby. I remember when I lived in Milwaukee in 1999, I had lived with three other people. One of my roommates had bought the original version of "Play" (which the version of the hit "South Side" did not have Gwen Stefani on vocals). My roommate would have "Play" on his stereo non-stop. It did not take me very long to fall in love with the album. I eventually acquired my own copy of "Play". Personally I think this is Moby's best album I have heard. After picking up few more of his cds, I noticed that "Play" picked up where "Everything is Wrong" left off with the gospel-infused techno sound. The majority of "Play" is good but there were a couple of misses. I hate saying this but Gwen Stefani has an annoying voice. I find her voice quite shrill. She totally ruins "South Side". I much prefer the original version which did not include her on the track. I was not really too keen on "Find My Baby" or "Bodyrock". Personally I absolutely loved the gospel infused "Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad?". It is a gorgeous ballad. Techno music rarely sounds emotional but in this particular case, the heartache in the gospel sample shines through. As overplayed as "Porcelain" was on various soundtracks and chill out compilations, I still love the beautiful melodies. The techno tracks are easily the best tracks on the cd while the more guitar orientated tracks were not as good. Nevertheless, I still consider "Play" a classic album in the electronic genre 
 This book has everything....Love, Greed, Murder.  What more can you ask for?  This book was one of the first romance novels I ever read, and I still have my original copy, that belonged to my mother.  I love to read it over and over again.  Luke and Roxy are two of my favorite characters.  Usually, the background characters tend to fade, but those in this book, Max, Mouse, Lily, and even Mike the dog are all memorable.  
 This book details research on bankruptcies and the American family.  Before I read it, I knew that a lot of people were having financial trouble in today's America, but I had no idea it had gotten so out of hand.  The authors make it clear that it's tougher for a family to make it today than it was a few decades ago.  This is not due to an increase in selfishness or irresponsibility; families really do have less discretionary income today.  This is in spite of the fact that far more women are working today.  The book is worth reading just for this information.   This certainly struck a chord with me.  My husband and I both work at good jobs, similar to the job my father had when I was a child.  Yet living the lifestyle my father and mother had when I was young is completely out of our reach.  My parents owned a detached house; we own a small condo.  They could afford several children and a wife who was a full-time homemaker; we have one child and find even that a financial struggle.  It is nice to know that we aren't the only ones.   When it comes to the author's policy prescriptions to solve this problem, some of their ideas are very good.  The authors make an excellent case for reregulating the interest rates credit card companies are allowed to charge. Allowing banks to charge very high rates only encourages them to make loans they know people can't afford to pay back.  The authors make a good point that the sale of actual goods has to a large extent now become a sort of financial sideline to where the real money is made, which is charging interest on the purchase.  (Maybe in their next book they can apply the same principle to student loans--education has now become a sideline to the student loan business.) I was disturbed that the authors missed one of the main reasons why housing is so much more expensive now.  The population of the U.S. has doubled since the 1940s.  There isn't enough room, or for that matter enough gasoline, for a house and a yard and the roads to reach them for all of those people.  Want to get housing prices back to a more reasonable level?  First, cut immigration and stabilize the U.S. population.  Second, change zoning laws to encourage higher density housing near jobs and public transportion.  
 I think this girl is really on drugs. Not sleeping right, Not eating, paranoid, Seeing "Shadow People," Always itching her nose, and itching her arm. She is seen in one scene where she's ironing and the iron isn't even plugged in.  Last scene of movie you see some kind of powder on the ground. Yup this girl was just a speed freak that just lost her mind.  Watch it though, it is still a good flick. 
 This is a very educational and fun book. I gave it as a gift to a 7 year old who has EVERYTHING and she has not put it down for weeks! The pictures are great, the information is great, and the trading cards in the back are a big plus. I highly recommend this book 
 As a second grade teacher, my students loved hearing this book during our Australia unit. Very informative with great pictures! I recommend for any child with a love of animals and an interest in Australia 
 I've been a professional writer for more than three decades.  This is one book that I have never been without for longer than it took to go buy another copy after giving one away.  It should be memorized by anyone who thinks they are a wordsmith 
 this book provides a great foundation for those interested in the networking of private, public, and non-profit sectors. great examples are included in the book, and it is relatively easy to use. Great book! 
 As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a "must-have" for all Iron Butterfly fans 
 I am a lonely and sad person regularly.  I would not describe myself as depressed, because depression too often has a meaning that the person is down due to misunderstanding.  My sadness is borne out of knowing that worthwhile ideas, methods, and interactions exist, and knowing I am no longer able to participate with them.  (Which ironically is an underestimated and underdiagnosed cause of real, clinical depression.)  When I get too sad, I pick up a book like this one by an author who has an insightful & challenging voice.  When I feel an absence of someone challenging me with new & good ideas, I pretend that instead of just reading Ms. Walker's books - I pretend she is in the room with me discussing her radical ideas and intent on keeping me company with her arousing ideals.  I imagine she appreciates attentive feedback, and a willingness to thoroughly consider all her ideas, even when she is angry.  And when I pause between ideas, I dream of a world that doesn't exist.  I dream that most people would choose to act in ways similar to Ms. Walker.  I allow myself to fantasize that most parents might choose to be less hypocritical and would agree to say for the sake of their daughters, "all I can promise her is not to lie" even if it "is painful to her, I believe nonetheless it is better than a lie.  Surely better than the lies I was told - 'for my own good' - only to sniff them out eventually and become entangled in them."    Then I get a peaceful, easy feeling and like a mad one, I choose to live as if "love is best expressed through truth," "Because to me, it is precisely our personal memories of joy and delight in each other and our present passions and loves that sustain us." p. 66  And like Ms. Walker, I stubbornly refuse to forget or to pretend those memories never occured.  It is a lonely refusal.  It may be an unwise refusal.  But it is a less unhealthy refusal for me than hypocrisy.  It is not a raging refusal (as Ms. Walker indicates it is in her at times).  And it is not a depressed refusal.  It is a clear, conscious, chosen & sad refusal.  And in that existence, I thank Ms. Walker for her ideas, her stubborn voice, her words against likely failures, and in my imaginary world - her companionship 
 If nothing else, The Molly Maguires holds a cinema record, of sorts, with its opening sequence that runs an astounding 14:51 before the first word of dialogue is even spoken!   But how does a production with the talents of Martin Ritt, James Wong Howe, Henry Mancini, Sean Connery and Richard Harris fail to achieve "A" film status?  Its script.  Its attempt to show the hardships of 19th Century Pennsylvania coal miners in an industrializing United States is way too sanitized. Maybe if some of the numerous bar scenes were better utilized to illustrate the cruel brutal existance that was a coal miner, you might have a better understanding of their plight. You never really quite understand why these men are so angry.   Howe's location photography is so beautiful (another distraction from the plight) and Henry Mancini's score rates a 10--a cult favorite, impossible to find on cd.  The supporting cast, including Samantha Eggar, Anthony Zerbe (the consumate guest star baddy on every TV series in the 70's and 80's), Frank Finlay and Philip Bourneuf each have their moments.   A period piece worthy of a watch as Connery and Harris do their best--if only the words were there.   Many of the sets still stand in Eckley, (Hazelton) PA, now a state museum, and continue to attract visitors to this day 
 There seldom comes into my reading life a book as fine as this one.  I read a lot of books, and frequently try new authors being published for the  first time.  This book completely blew me away.  The author has such a  wonderful command of our language - using phrases and words to their best  advantage.  He exhibits such an intense ability to get inside his  characters - to be able to give them feelings that are so easily conveyed  to his reader.  I laughed at times, I cried at times.  This is one of those  fine examples of books that you don't want to finish - you simply sigh at  the end and wish for more 
 I bought this cd to finally own the first track, "Love is Alive," and had no idea what I was getting myself into with the rest of the album.  I didn't like the song "Dream Weaver" that much, and the other songs I had never heard before.  Now four years later and after listening to this album several hundred times, I rank this as one of the best albums from the seventies.  I even like "Dream Weaver" now!  The music is excellent: straight ahead rock; swirling, slower, moog-driven love...all belted out by Gary's great, soul-singer voice.  If you like R'n'R, you'll love this album 
 This is a very good family movie it shows how being a single parent that  you can still have dignity 
 I love all songs and music by this Man! I have tried to get everything of his I can. This is a good CD I like this one alot. I was heart broken when I heard that he was gone 
 I work in an organization that supports advanced gene therapy research that may lead to new therapies for chronic and life threatening diseases, but I am not a scientist. As a communicator, I needed to understand the long and arduous journey from discovery to pre-clinical research, to FDA-approved clinical manufacturing, and to human clinical trials. This book was excellent in helping me understand both the research and the regulatory environment.  The author says it best in the introduction, "The intention of this book is to provide an overview about how a drug is discovered, the amount of and types of laboratory tests that are performed, and the conduct of clinical trials before a drug is ready to registered for human use." The author also fully explains the role of regulatory authorities in these processes.  The book includes chapters on: Drug discovery Drug development and preclinical studies Clinical trials Good Manufacturing Practice  You'll also learn about things like toxicology studies, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics, and Investigational New Drug applications. Although the book contains some technical discussions and exhibits, the author has a logical and easy-to-understand way of presenting the information.  If, like me, you need to get a better understanding of process of getting basic drug research to the market, this book is for you. 
 This has to be the best bargain since I found a Harry Partch record for 50 cents in a public library sale. The first CD alone in "A Lazarus Taxon" is worth the cover price. In the liner notes, Alan Licht quotes Brian Eno's "Unfinished" essay: "It used to be the case that a record was expected to contain the definitive and perhaps only version of a song, and that the job of the band and the producer was to create this "ideal" object." This collection does a great job of dispelling that old notion forever, as some of the tracks are so much developed from the originals that they resemble a house built around 300 year old foundations. To hear how "Gamera" evolved out of "His Second Story Island" is intriguing--maybe it should be the subject of a documentary in itself. This is now my favorite Tortoise CD;  I thought "Millions Now Living" would never be bettered, but this one makes this band's music more like the living, open source language it should be. The production is so good that I decided to buy better earphones, and better speakers. (Maybe it wasn't so much of a bargain, after all. 
 Gary Demar's "Last Days Madness" is a knock-out punch of Tim Lahaye's view on end times (i.e., dispensational, pre-tribulation, pre-millennialism). Gary Demar has developed a refutation that is quick reading and systematic.  Gary Demar exposes the weaknesses of the dispensational, pre-tribulation, pre-millennialism view of end times by showing example after example of their inconsistent interpretation of the Holy Bible (i.e., inconsistent hermeneutic).  Gary Demar's Preterist view needs further discussion and study as discussed by R.C. Sproul's  in "The Last Days According to Jesus".  Both should be required reading for anyone that is studying and attempting to develop their own position on end times and end times theology.    NOTE: I'm still undecided on acceptance of Demar's Preterism but am continuing to study and develop my own view on end times theology. 
 I really enjoyed this book. It gives a wonderful perspective on what it was like to be a woman in China in the mid-1800s. Of course, the woman who was portrayed in this historical novel was quite the unusual woman herself, coming into power through being a concubine of the emperor, but one who came to be highly favored because of her wonderful intellectual capabilities.  The book itself was wonderfully written. The author is particularly skilled at describing the things that motivates each of the main characters in the book. I would definitely recommend the book to those who are intrigued about China and its history 
 Do you want to learn basics in many-body physics? This book will provide your needs 
 Just wanted to let the Raspberries fans out there know that the sound on these new imports is fantastic!  I have the first two and i'm anxiously awaiting the final two to be released.  They come in beautiful digipaks.  I gave these first 2 albums 4 stars, saving the 5 stars for the awesome 'Side 3' and 'Starting Over' 
 A couple gave me the full set for Christmas in 1974.  They thought it would provide me insights for preaching that also benefit them as hearers of the sermons.  I used it by means of the index volume for many years.  Finally, I decided to read all nine text volumes cover-to-cover.  It took me six years to finish, but I found things  I did not find through the index and would never have known to seek.  At times articles in Kittel can numb the mind with boredom.  At other times they can cause it to soar with new insights based in an array of factual information.  The reader will probably not agree with everything.  Certainly, individual contributors of the articles do not always agree with one another.  Still, I would not be without Kittel.  My copy is drenched in ink from underlinings and notes I have made as I read it.  I know it would be tempting to buy the one volume "baby Kittel" and skip the extra expense of the larger set, but there are key pieces of information that did not make it into the editors' view of what should be included in the one volume edition. Spend the money and get the real thing. There have been some tremendous discount specials that make the whole set little more than the list price of the "baby" version 
 This is one of the very first attempts at a real Jesus, one who speaks to us through himself, and not through one of the many churches who shout his name...thereby drowning all thought.  It's superbly written by a leading Hebrew scholar of his day.  I gave it five stars for two reasons.  One.  To try to reflect its worth more accurately than the above review.  Two.  It bloody deserves it 
 This DVD is of pretty good quality, not "remastered", but normal DVD quality, and it is in "widescreen" format, the audio is fine. There are no extra features.  I wondered if this was ever coming out on DVD, and why not? Look at the cast - Danny DeVito, Penelope Ann Miller, Gregory Peck, Piper Laurie, Dean Stockwell. It did well at the box office, but then....nothing. Well it's finally here.  I agree that the match-up of Danny DeVito and Penelope Ann Miller seems a bit odd at the beginning, but as the movie unfolds, you begin to understand the attraction. Danny's attraction to Penelope's character is for obvious reasons, but her's are NOT so obvious.  However, as she gets to know him she finds that, in spite of his appearance, he is not only rich and powerful, but also a smart, funny, romantic, caring person who also provides her with the most powerful aphrodisiac of all - he admits he's madly in love with her. We all find THAT very attractive in another person, don't we? Still, this movie doesn't provide that usual "guy gets the girl" ending, but leaves it hanging as a possibility, since Penelope's character, in spite of her attraction, is still somewhat put off - both by his appearance, and his profession.  This is a great movie about the "merger and acquisition" frenzy of the 80's, and has absolutely stellar acting and writing. I also like that Penelope's character doesn't mind using her obvious physical assets to her advantage. After all, if you've got the smarts to back it up, then why not? All's fair, and so on. All-in-all a very enjoyable movie, maybe not for everyone, but certainly just right for some.  And it really points out that you CAN'T judge a book by it's cover 
 Minimalism has produced five masterpieces: Philip Glass' "Music in Twelve Parts" and "Einstein on the Beach," La Monte Young's "The Well-Tuned Piano" (good luck finding that one!), Steve Reich's "Music for 18 Musicians," and Terry Riley's "In C." Although there are several recordings of "In C", each with a different orchestration, this one is probably still the best recording after all is said and done. (I only wish Mr. Riley would make a much longer recording, AT LEAST two hours long. 
 I received the book An Unfinished life:John F. Kennedy in excellent condition and in one week.  I was sent exactly what I wanted to purchase 
 My son was born with "fat" feet...girth and width.  I have only found one shoe brand that he seems to be comfortable in and that's Stride Rite!  They have wide and double wide widths!  They are well worth the money you pay to have your tot's wide feet comfy and not squished!  These shoes have also withstood toddler torture of rain, mud, and general wear and are still well put together.  Even from being washed!  
 Pretty good riff on Studs Terkel's "The Good War" (he's even thanked)adds biting undead to the equation. Max Brooks' book shouldn't be as good as it is. It is a pretty good page turner, with interesting people, still somewhat disbelieving, just coming out of their shock and grief to tell the story of their part in the battle for humanity. The structure of the book is strong and the shape of the war becomes clear as different narrators step up to have their say. Unfortunately, the time line is a little, um, wobbly at the end as a book which starts in the near future- just past 2007- ends up several years later showing cultural time markers of it being the late 1980s or early 1990s- probably when Max Brooks was in college and, not having a child yet still had time to pay attention to cultural signifiers. Still, these are the things that raise a book from a fun, trashy read- which "World War Z" definitely is- to a level of Art, which it, quite simply, ain't 
 I bought this for my daughter and started showing it to her when she was 9 months old. She is now a year. From the beginning she loved it! I was surprised how entranced a 9 month old could be! It took about 2 months before she made her first sign: milk! She uses it all the time now when she wants her bottle. She especially likes the music. She will get a little restless near the end which shows that it is just about the right length for a baby! For some reason,though, she has always seemed to lose interest when the music and sign for "shoes" comes on! After it's over, she's gets right into the video again! Maybe it's the music. The rest is classical with no words and that part is modern sounding with words. All in all,though,I would highly recommend this video 
 "These Are The Tales" is an awesome follow-up to Cocaine Raps Vol. 2. Those who say Nicky fell off with this album are complete idiots. "These are the tales" is just as good as CR2, if not even better. As I've said in previous reviews, Andre Nickatina a.k.a. Dre Dog is one of the greatest rappers in the industry, period. He's most definitely one of the most talented and original ones out there, with a special style of his own - both lyrically and both musically. He doesn't follow the lead, and each one of his album sound different, Nicky always steps his game up. He always innovates, never duplicates, and he's one of the few who menage to come out with something noone has ever heard and yet still doesn't sound weird, but dope!!. Andre Nickatina is amazing, all of his works are peaces of art, and the man is a genius. I mean, who else can rap over those Irish/Scotish beats and STILL SOUND DOPE?! Only Nickatina!... On These Are The Tales, Nickatina once again comes out with a masterpiece. The album is perfect from beginning to the end. You get what we all love from Nickatina, even though the album is (as usual) not a long one. The title track is a tribute by Nicky to one of his favorite rappers, Bay Area legend, Too $hort: it's a Nickatina version of Short Dog's classic "Freaky Tales", yet "These Are the Tales" is even funnier (the beat is just a as addictive)!! "Rose" is without a doubt one of the top 5 greatest rap love songs, for real! All those suckas these days (like those G-UNot fools or wanna-be pimp Snoop Dog) TRY to make love songs, yet are afraid to come out "too soft", so the songs they make always sound fake and phony. Well, on "Rose" Nickatina delivers one of his greatest songs ever, it's so touching, so real, you actually are able to feel everything Nicky is feeling. That's what being a REAL person and artist is all about! He reminds me of Pac in that way. Nicky never pretends he's somethig he's not - he's not a gangsta, he's not a dope dealer- he's an artist, a person with feelings, trying to survive in this rap game, and he does it to the "T". "I Saw a Gangsta Cry" is another tremendous song. So are "Candy Rain" and "One Ticket Please", There are so many others... As usual you get a few interludes, where there's only (awesome) music (or Nickatina saying a few lines). Most songs are short (2 verses long), which leaves you with a hunger for more...  I can't say enough about this record, Nicky delivered again. His voice is so captivating, a quality all great rappers got. It's not only about his lyrics, but also about the way he deliveres them (unlike all those boring-a** New York MCs that you can fall asleep listening to their "sophisticated" lyrics with boring flows) I think this one is even HARDER than CR2, which had more laid-back songs... Get this album and support one of the greatest artists in the music industry! Andre and his label Fillmoe Coleman Records did it again 
 I was glad I got an opportunity to read this book before watching the Discovery Channel's Deadliest Catch.  I had long heard about the Alaskan Crab fishery and was very interested in learning more.  This book did a great job in describing the process, people, and equipment used in catching crabs and much more.  It gave an overall picture of what the crabbers go through, in a deeper way than the TV series did for me.  I loved the Deadliest Catch too, but I feel that this book did a better job of educating you about what was going on than the show did.  The book is a first person account of what it was like to be in the boots and rain gear of an actual crab fisherman.  Also, in the style of books like a perfect storm, Walker steps out of his narrative into other related subjects to help fill out the picture.  The book is well worth the time.  I definitely respect those that choose this career more after having read this 
 If you could only own one Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler album this is the one.  What you have here on two CDS is a baker's dozen of Straits songs, two of Knopfler's movie themes, six Knopfler solo tunes, and a first-time-heard duet with Emmylou Harris.  Total: 140 minutes of music -- which is about as much as you can cram onto two CDs.       You could complain about the song selection.  I would have liked to have seen "Railroad Work Song" from the Notting Hillbillies on which Knopfler plays guitar as well as anyone in the world ever has. And a tune from his CD with Chet Atkins would be nice too.  But most of Dire Strait's best are here.  "Brothers in Arms" is awe-inspiring and sad; "Telegraph Road" is a 14-minute epic of brilliant guitar solos; "Sultans of Swing" is the all time Dire Straits favorite with a chugging beat that can't be beat; "Romeo and Juliet" is a quirky love song played on that weird steel guitar that Knopfler loves. And of course you've gotta include the head-banging "Money for Nothing" because it's famous -- and famously overplayed.      Knopfler's more recent solo efforts are a bit quieter and may not be as well known.  "Sailing to Philadelphia" is a wondrous duet with James Taylor; "What Aye Man" is a sea chanty with some fancy guitar licks.  There isn't a bad song here.   Knopfler writes clever,thoughtful songs, sings a bit like Bob Dylan, and plays a ringing but ethereal guitar.  This is quality rock music. One comment:  "Darling Pretty" is on the English version of the CD; on the American version it is replaced with "Skateaway."    Smallchief             
 One day in early 1968 I bought the album Wheels of Fire by Cream. Cream of course featured Eric Clapton. I put on the live disc and listened to a song called "Crossroads" and became hooked.  At that time I didnt have a clue who Robert Johnson was or what blues was. I over the years listened to blues through "White" artists like Eric Clapton, The Allman Bros and others. One day I broke down and bought a Robert Johnson album and a whole new world was opened up to me. I had no idea what "Mississippi Delta" blues was compared to "Chicago Blues" etc. For years I have listened to these recordings and was never able to hear the originals.  People like Eric Clapton have changed the arrangements on many of these songs to suit their styles. Now through this recording I am finally able to hear what the song was originally like. I personally love the slide guitar of the Mississippi Delta. I love the "rawness" of those recordings. I am also able to hear the electric side that came from Chicago as blues players migrated there. This Cd has the finest songs by the best blues artists ever. This set includes Mississippi Fred McDowell, Robert Johnson, Skip James, BB King, Buddy Guy, Maceo Merriweather, Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy Waters, Son House and the list just goes on and on. It also includes the "White" side of the blues including Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaugh, Bonnie Raitt and many others. This is a celebration of the blues, and is a must for any collector, or fan of the blues. This CD is for people like me who have listened to the blues for so many years and now want to listen to the real thing. You will never find a better collection in your lifetime... 
 the faculty is definently a guilty pleasure. combining the classic aliens invade earth scenerio with a hip teen vibe put into the mix, kevin williamsen and robert rodriguez then mix it into a fun ride with clever humor, creepy aliens, and tons of water. all the while biulding up the suspense and parinoa. the film is about six high school students each diffrent in everyway who begin to suspect there teachers are not from this world and soon they find out about this alien that takes over humans, think of it like a invasion of the body snatchers scenerio. now they must stop this thing from being unleashed to the whole world. both sides deliver good characters from the faculty of stars like famke janssen, selma hayek, and the terminator guy along with the six students but its obvious that duvall and wood steal the show. good movie to watch on a off day, it will really give you that sense that maybe your teachers arent what they seem 
 This new one from DJ Clue just takes him to another level. It shows how  versatile he can be with songs for the club, to slow songs to r+b to hard  core rap. This time around he pulls in new artists like T-boz and rell to  join on the mix who both have good songs. The new song "Road  dogs" is one of the best songs on the a;lbum with a tight beat.  "In the club" with benie segal is another good one. I give this 5  stars just for the songs I liked on it. Out of 19 songs I liked 12 so I  think it was still worth it. If your looking for a new mix album to bump in  the car or anywhere then this is the cd to get 
 	"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate" stars Martin Lawrence, Lynn Whitfield, Regina King, Bobby Brown and Della Reese.  This is easily one of my favorite movies; I often watch it when I'm feeling depressed because it eases my mood and reminds me that even though we may face hard times, someone is always going through something worse than you. 	The movie is a about a player (womanizer) named Darnell who is confident that he can get any woman he wants.  He was able to get women easily, because he was charming and co-owner of a hot club in town, so he was looking for a challenge.  He found that challenge in Brandy Webb. Brandy is not your average female.  She is high maintenance and rich.  She does not deal with men like Darnell, for they are mid-class players.  Darnell wants Brandy badly and goes through a lot to get her.  While he is chasing Brandy, though, his old flame Mia is back in town from the Army.  Darnell still has feelings for, but mind you, he is still chasing Brandy, and Mia is dating a well to do man.  Darnell finally is able to get a date with Brandy, and after spending lots of time with her, he accomplishes his goal and "hits it".  After he hits it, he loses interest in Brandy and pursues Mia.  However, Brandy is not going to let Darnell go that easily.  She does all she can to get revenge on Darnell.  The whole while Darnell's mother is warning him about playing women, but he always brushes her off.  In the end, Darnell CERTAINLY learns a lesson. 	I absolutely love this movie.  The comedic performance is wonderful.  I love the plot.  I have never seen a black movie with this type of plot, so it was different.  Martin Lawrence showed innovation in creating this movie.  It is also neat that he named this movie after the song entitled "A Thin Line Between Love and Hate".  The song and movie are about the same subject: "The sweetest woman in the world can be the meanest woman in the world, if you make her that way".  This is a line from the song.   	I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh and some drama.   
 I do not profess to love cooking on any level.  I find it cumbersome to satisfy my family with one dish.  THIS WAS AWESOME!  Easy recipes and her commentary at the top of every recipe was priceless.  My crew has loved everything I have tried.  We don't have "known" food allergies, and I did adjust the ingredients to what was in the kitchen that day.  LOVE IT!  Thank you.  I would love a sequel 
 As a child, born and raised in France, I was taught evolution by the school system. As a kid, I also read the Bible and was quite impressed by the story. I never saw an issue between the two because one is based on science and the other on faith. The old continent (Europe) has learned at its expense the devastating consequences of mixing religion and state affairs. For some reason, the USA is still struggling with the definitive separation of State and Church. This book is part of a higher issue than just evolution but also on our government and ill-informed people that use again religion as a personal gain. I recommend the creationist/IDC camp to get familiar with Logic so they are capable of making a sound judgment about life and matters that revolve around it. Finally, I wonder how many of these creationists/IDCs have actually read the "On the Origin species" by Darwin, where the author already actually recognizes that they might be some refutations to his theories because of some missing links not yet discovered.  
 A stunning achievement, as deft and vivid as you'll likely hear all year, and as frightening, stimulating, fearsome, beautiful, dangerous as any graphic novel.  In a time when `Gangsta' has watered itself down to a point where the cartoon minstrelsy of a 50 Cent or a Game flourish in the multi-platinum zone, Ghostface, one of the great Hip Hop lyricists of our time, squeaks toward gold.  The beats are fresh and living, thanks most notably to the late J Dilla and Pete Rock, with borrowed stimulus from MF Doom, and the exposition incisive and dramatic - and soulful.  Those who decry the brutality of some of the `novellas' are the same as those who worship "The Sopranos", shining a light on bigger race issues than they're likely to admit.  If the hierarchy in Hip Hop is the late, great Biggie, then Ghostface is heir to the throne. This just might be the album of the year.  My grade:   
 Harrison Ford and Wendy Crewson are believable in this action/human story of what happens when the presidents plane is hijacked. The real story however is about how hard it is to hold to ones principles when doing so means the death of a loved one. It is a quality, action movie 
 The book gave me insight to the world of the Investment Banker.  It is funny and very interesting.  It made me realize Enron is not an isolated case 
 This was a wonderful book - couldn't put it down!  The contrast between the Tewa indians and the scientists at Los Alamos made a wonderful backdrop from which to explore the frontiers of current thinking in cosmology and physics.  George Johnson is a great writer.  Perhaps being from New Mexico enhanced my enjoyment.  Anyway, I loved it 
 What a difference, the one we had skipped and no good sound this is like night and day.   Great sound.   I recomend this highl 
 Publishers are developing a growing number of encyclopedias on folklore these days.  This volume is one of the best ones currently in print.  It covers a wider variety of topics and groups of people.  The insightful articles develop a strong base for understanding folklore, and researchers can use this book as a reference source for finding more publications on a range of topics.  The book balances its reading level so that it is accessible to general readers, but its content is grounded in solid scholarship.  It's also a fine source for finding quick references to various topics of interest in the study of folk belief, legends, traditional music, folk dance, customs, and other folklore genres 
 I have not used my stockpot as yet, we are in the process of having a new kitchen installed.  It is very similar to my other pots but a lot less money.  This will not be used every day and I like the glass lid.  It is the right size as I have a 12 quart All Chad for larger items 
 Purchased as a gift for myself.  Large print - 12 pitch, makes it easy to see and can read for longer peirods of time with out eye fatigue or headache developing. Well worth it.   
 I stumbled across this book when I was 18 or 19, almost a decade ago.  I did not expect to like it so much.  Sure, some of the ideas and references are now rather outdated (the book was published in 1974) but at the time it first came out, the novel must've been revolutionary and groundbreaking for women.  Many controversial themes are explored through the character of Isadora White Wing: sexual freedom, artistic freedom, marital dissatisfaction, a woman's desire to call her own shots and to be able to love whom she pleases.  The book overflows with warmth, courage, and sometimes wisdom as spoken through the musings of the young female protagonist (Isadora is not yet 30).  Reading this book had quite an impact on me.  I read all the author's other books.  The writing is simple and straightforward and very, very candid.  At its core, Jong tells a story about the human heart from a woman's perspective. 
 This is a very careful, detailed analysis of decision making in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations about the extent of American involvement in Vietnam.  Based on meticulous and original archival research, Kaiser sets the decisions of both the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses against the background of the foreign policies of the Eisenhower administration.  While a number of scholars have presented Eisenhower's Cold War policy as relatively cautious and non-confrontational, Kaiser argues that in many respects the Eisenhower era policies were relatively aggressive and rigidly confrontational.  Kaiser account rings true.  While Eisenhower was cautious about direct confrontations with the Soviet Union and China, in the Third World his administration pursued aggressive policies towards regimes that were suspected to have leftist elements, such as the Arbenz regime in Guatemala or the Mossadegh regime in Iran.  When Kennedy assumed office, the State Dept. and Pentagon were imbued with and preferred to carry forward Eisenhower era approaches.  The Kennedy administration also inherited the problem of South Vietnam and our less than satisfactory ally, the authoritarian and progressively corrupt Diem regime.  By the early 1960s, the Communist regime of North Vietnam had reactivated their efforts to reunite Vietnam.  Kennedy was pressed by many of his advisors to pursue an agressive course in Vietnam, up to and including a large US presence in Vietnam, invasion of the North, and even the use of nuclear weapons, all consistent with Eisenhower era policies.  Kaiser's depiction of Kennedy is quite interesting.  He shows him to be quite intelligent and knowledgeable about foreign affairs, skeptical about the policies suggested by the Pentagon and State Dept., and very good at encouraging diverse opinions among his advisors.  At the same time, Kaiser presents considerable documentation that many of our diplomatic and military leaders fundamentally misunderstood events in Southeast Asia.  From a diplomatic point of view, overemphasizing the importance of Vietnam and from a military point of view, completely misunderstanding the nature of the challenge posed by the insurgency in South Vietnam.  Kennedy's confidence and skepticism led him to resist suggestions for major American involvement and Kaiser makes a good case he would have continued in this vein in a second term in office.   The case of Johnson is quite different.  Johnson wanted to be a great domestic president, and almost achieved that status.  Johnson, however, was less experienced in foreign policy, more doctrinaire in his anti-communism, and more deferential to the Pentagon and the State Dept., ultimately accepting the case for a major US involvement in Vietnam.  Kaiser has a nice description of the relatively deceitful manner in which the Johnson administration went about proceeding to war, something that would have major consequences later on.   Kaiser presents the decision to make a major US commitment in Vietnam as a spectacular and avoidable error brought by doctrinaire anti-communism, refusal to consider quite a bit of contrary data and dissenting opinions, overconfidence in the value of military force, and excessive concentration on the problems of Southeast Asia. My one criticism of Kaiser is that he tends to interpret actions of many of the major actors in terms of generational effects.  Many of the major US decision makers were members of the GI generation whose experience with WWII had apparently taught them the power of American military power and the dangers of what they saw as appeasement.  He looks at other actors from the point of view of their important generational experiences.  This is a reasonable point but Kaiser tends to apply it in an excessively deterministic fashion.    
 To start the process of understanding strategic planning, you need to take some courses, speak to lots of people, try quite a few things out (many of which will be dead ends) and read quite a few books.  The books need to be mulled over for quite some time, and from the morass of conflicting information, you pull out something useful.    Now, what books should you read?  Clearly, I haven't read, nor am I ever likely to read them all, but, Strategic Planning for Non Profit Organizations is definitely one of them.  It is indeed a practical guide which serves everyone well in nonprofits and is eminently adaptable to Profit and Govenrnmental organisations.  The pages I went back to constantly included that containing the map of the strategic planning process (p11 1997 edition) and The Language of Planning table and explanations (P16-17).  They represent an excellent summary after reading the book.  After my third read, when I had a greater appreciation of the context in which planning is done, I thought it might even be THE text that everyone looks for, but, alas, it crashed and burned at one crucial point which is why I only give it 4 stars.  As with all books of this type it did the "hand-waving, hey presto trick" in attempting to join two critical components - core strategies and programs.  One moment we get to core strategies - no problems (Step 4.3, p116-123).  A few sections later we get to writing goals and objectives for programs (Step 4.6 p130-143). There should have been a more explicit section on how the programs relate to the strategies.  The reason this can't be done is that any given program relates to more than one strategy and invariably, all books on strategy stick to the hierarchical model (not a network model).  The assumption is always one of mutually exclusive categories because that makes things easier.  Now each of these sections, individually, have a wealth of useful information.  It's the relationship between them that's the problem.   The join was not only not smooth, it was not existent.  Not to worry, other books which I have read have solved this problem only to create a different problem elsewhere - which is why you need to read a suite of books to get proper context.  Despite everything I have said, it really is a great book.  I will certainly be using it time and time again into the future because of the wealth of insight it contains 
 Le fanu is the BEST writer of supernatual fiction there is...no questions!  I am the biggest fan...I collect all his works...old and new when I can find them.  The stories collected here are some rare ones indeed. The Haunted Baronet (from the Golden Friars) is a stunning gem of a novellete. Included in this volume are some very hard to come by edtions. And they have been reprinted exactly from the periodicals they were originally in.  I am sure you will not be disappointed in this book....like me you will read it again and again. The evocative power of Le Fanu is unparalled 
 There are many books out there that talk about how to tell stories; that isn't the focus of this new work. This unique book shows just how stories can be used by leaders to make a difference. Story is a hot topic right now, but Lorie Silverman provides a fresh window into the strategic use of story and provides actual evidence on the results you can achieve. That makes this book a powerful tool in advancing the use of story in organizations. If you want to sell your leadership team on using stories, have them read this book, and then get busy finding and sharing your own stories. Stories work; now we have evidence. 
 David Steinberg has put together a collection of erotic photographs that, while exposing us to the many facets of the sexual world, moves sexual photography itself into the realm of fine art. Sometimes startling, sometimes breathtaking, sometimes bizarre, yet always absorbing, these photos will engage you through form, texture and substance. I believe that this book may well become the standard by which future fine art books of sexual photography will be measured 
 Hooray! The new world order takes a dive!   A riveting, gripping thriller for modern times. A quick read, you won't be able to put it down. Neo-con subversion meets good old-fashioned detective work. Highly recommended 
 I own Kama Sutra- it's one of my favorites in my movie collection.  I too, thoroughly enjoyed this movie and agree with many of the ratings other consumers posted, however, if I was looking to purchase the movie, I don't think I it would be neccessary after all the specific detail given up in the review section.  The idea of a review is to rate the movie and state your opinion, not give an in depth, written, scene for scene tell all.  What's the point of buying it, when so many customers have simply given away the entire film in an attempt to review it?  Please people, practice some restraint, I share your enthusiasm, but really what's posted here is TMI.  Too much information, don't ruin it for those who haven't experienced the adventure of Mira Nair's Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love 
 Ivy Meeropol takes us behind the scenes into the lives of the children of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing prison for treason in June of 1953.  This extraordinary documentary focuses primarily on the impact of this tragic miscarriage of justice on Ivy and her family.  Viewers who expect to learn about the facts of Rosenberg case are advised to look elsewhere; this is Ivy's story primarly, although we do learn enough about Ethel Rosenberg to appreciate that this was a woman of remarkable integrity and courage.  She could easily have saved her life by betraying her friends and family.  She chose death before dishonor.  Ivy's father Michael and her uncle Robert were young children abandoned by their relatives who did not want to be associated with anyone connected with the notorious Rosenberg trial.  Ann and Abel Meeropol adopted the two boys; Michael became a college professor and Robert a lawyer. Both men have spent much of their adult lives attempting to learn the true facts of the case against their parents.  Ivy discovers that Ethel Rosenberg's brother, David Greenglass, by his own admission, gave false testimony against his sister.   In one scene of the film she drives by the home of Greenglass, but decides against interviewing him.  Greenglass has worked hard to disappear from the public view and has, for the most part, been successful.  Ivy is not ready to question Greenglass about his false testimony.  We respect her reticence in this sensitive matter.  Ivy does visit other relatives, some of whom are now ashamed that they did not have the courage to support the innocent children of the Rosenbergs.  Ivy's purpose is to reestablish family ties; accusation and blame are not on her agenda.   The fact that Ivy comes from a loving family helps us to understand her strength as she confronts the bigotry and lies she tries to dispel with openness and truth.  She is supported completely by her father Michael, her mother Ann, and her brother Gregg.    Heir to an Execution is, perhaps, the wrong title for this moving documentary.  This title suggests an unhappy ending for Ivy and nothing could be more mistaken.  Ivy's journey reveals to her that she is the fortunate daughter of a family that has survived misfortune and become stronger, not by disappearing as David Greenglass has attempted to do, but instead by going public and seeking the truth.  We, the viewers, are fortunate that Ivy has decided to share her quest with us.  Highly recommended!     
 Seduced by a beautiful sociopath and entranced by the promise of wealth, insurance agent Walter Huff decides to use his insider knowledge of the insurance industry to plot the perfect crime--with a big payoff.  James M. Cain's minimalist style allows his plot to advance rapidly in this short novel.  His characters are revealed effectively and with great economy.  Phyllis Nirdlinder, the femme fatale of the piece, is a chilling psychopath--a key difference from the equally brilliant, though often radically divergent, Billy Wilder film adaptation.  Some criticize the novel's conclusion, but I found it to be haunting 
 It wasn't exactly what I expected to read, but I found the story interesting and fun to escape into.   Would have been even better with more technical info and historical background of the hedge fund business and derivatives markets in Asia. 
 I bought this item to be used with my Sony HDR-HC3 camcorder in combination the fig rig. It works as advertised. I do wish the clamp portion of the item was removeable, but it can be worked around. I found the remote to be very responsive, as you would expect from Sony. And the price was a bargin.

Despite all odds he does what many people thought was  impossible.  He had went through many hardships but never gave up.  He gave  hie people hope and something to shoot for now that he did the impossibe.   Jackie Robinson was a her 
 My grandmother buys baking soda in bulk and loves using it, so I bought this book for her one Christmas.  She seems to like the book and has been able to use many of the suggestions.  One of the tips that she found helpful was using baking soda for cleaning the oven.  Baking soda can provide a natural alternative to many other products.  This book can be an inexpensive gift or a helping hand for you 
 I had heard that the movie had some good drills that my daughter might benefit from.  The dribbling work the actor does is amazing, but most of these things can be done with practice.  My daughter is now proficient at the drills we chose to work on.  She made the Varsity as a freshman a few days ago.  The story is a good one.   It goes into some of the hardships he faced as a kid, but not some of the tougher things he faced as an adult.  It is definitely a family movie 
 This often hard to find album represents a really SLICK side of COLD BLOOD...   Unlike their earlier East Bay psychadelic funky rockin' Blues and Soul outtings, this album has a bit of a Jazzy edge thrown into their trademark rockin' soul mix - -  by Jazzy, I mean as in the Saturday Night Live horns, Al Rubin/Lou Marini, Dr. John and the other great Jazz/Soul/Rock influenced studio bands of the era... not Grover Washington or the Crusaders! - -Everything is tight and crisp and highly energetic... and the solos are just as mean as the engineering.  - - The group at this point is somewhere in between Blood Sweat and Tears and Tower of Power... literally....  Tighter than ever... Lydia is strong, and there's a wild sax solo on READY TO LIVE that made my hair stand on end...   - - A very different sound than their outtings on the SAN FRANCISCO label, this was COLD BLOOD at their peak (at a time they were very well giving TOP a nice run for their money !) and shows a Lydia who's kinda moved *a bit* away from the Janis Joplin thing and has a sound of her own (Janis Joplin meets Chaka Kahn ???)   All in all... this is ESSENTIAL brass rock 'n soul listening ! ! !   If you like this CD, check out Tower of Power's IN THE SLOT...  
 A book which has achieved more notoriety for its sex scenes (shocking in 1930, when the book was written) than for its character studies, Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the affair between Constance, the "sturdy" young wife of Clifford Chatterley, and the gamekeeper of the Chatterleys' estate in the remote midlands.  Constance, who married Clifford a month before he left for World War I, has become his caretaker since his return from the war, paralyzed from the waist down and impotent.  A writer who surrounds himself with intellectual friends, Clifford regards Connie as his hostess and caregiver and does not understand her abject yearning for some life of her own.  The distance between Constance and Clifford increases when Mrs. Bolton, a widow from the village, becomes his devoted caretaker, and he becomes increasingly dependent upon her.  In a remarkable scene, Clifford finally tells Connie that he'd like an heir, and he does not care whom she finds to be the father of "his" child.  He believes, in fact, that he could treat her affair as if it were a trip to the dentist.  Connie, yearning for an emotional closeness which she has never experienced before, soon becomes involved with Mellors, the estate's gamekeeper.  Crude and anti-social, Mellors has an honesty and lack of pretension which Connie finds refreshing.    Throughout the novel, Lawrence creates finely drawn characters whose interactions and gradual changes are explored microscopically.  The growth of love between Connie and Mellors is complicated by the increasing self-centeredness of Clifford, whose outrage at rumors of their affair is motivated by Connie's choice of someone so far beneath her.  To Clifford, the separation of the social classes is an integral and inevitable part of life.  Devoted to achieving financial success even at the expense of his workers, the paralyzed Clifford is depicted as a symbol of unfeeling aristocracy and government.  Mellors, by contrast, is vigorous and full of life, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.  Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which, though dated, celebrates the driving passions which can make life worth living.  The romantic scenes and language here are tame by modern standards, and the extreme behavior and willingness to flout convention by Connie and Mellors may be less realistic, psychologically, than what would make sense to a modern reader.  Firmly rooted in the 1930's, the novel shows an insensitive Clifford adhering to  outdated values, based on outdated economic structures, while Connie and Mellors, freed from these conventions, explore their inner natures and their humanity. n Mary Whipple  
 combining solid song-writing,production,and playing there own instruments they grooved.this set bumps like madd here.i couldn't wait to get this they were not only great musicians but also super fine.they were more than just  a disco group or fad they were real deal artists.this disc has many diverse  styles and tastes 
 The strength of this book is in the customization, such as creating your own Picture Tubes. It's extremely hard to find Paint Shop Pro books that don't focus exclusively on enhancing and cleaning up digital photos. This is one of the very few. However, this is not at all a book for anyone new to Paint Shop Pro. It assumes a strong knowledge of concepts and basic functions, for that you may want to her "Paint Shop Pro Solutions" book. Neither book has much - if any - color in it, which is unfortunate, but the instructions are clear and concise. 
 The purpose of this review is to bring your attention to the second author of this timeless classic. Apparently most reviewers give all the credit to the first author, Richard Courant. Allow me to bring the second author, Herbert Robbins, to your attention. Google his name and you will find that Herbert Robbins is one of the most prolific and creative statisticians ever existed. Robbins studied mathematics at Harvard in the 1930s. At the time he worked with Courant on this book, he was a young rising star in mathematics/statistics. I have every reason to believe that Robbins has done more to this book than we give him credit for. We may never know the exact magnitude of Robbins's contribution to this book, but a complete ignorance of him is certainly unjust.    
 Nice read, tracks the movie well with one big exception, but you have to see the movie to find out about that.  
 Every time I hear this album or any other SOS album it blows my mind all over again! The first song I ever heard of theirs was "Tell me if you still care" and I was hooked. I can't believe that more of their albums have not been re-released on CD. I mean can we talk about jams like, "Sands of Time", "No Lies", "Weekend Girl", "Just Be Good To Me", the list can go on and on. I grew up around the corner from Flyte Tyme Studios and was lucky enough to get Sands of Time on CD, don't pass this up 
 A road movie for the fairer sex, "Boys on the Side" is helped immeasurably by the performances of Mary-Louise Parker, Drew Barrymore, and Whoopi Goldberg. The latter plays a lesbian nightclub singer (!) who agrees to share the wheel with repressed, straight-laced Parker on a trip to San Diego. Following a serious misadventure with her drug pusher boyfriend, the still pixy-ish  Barrymore joins the journey.  "Boys on the Side" is as contrived as a soap opera with each character facing a personal crisis, but the three stars are so good, it's easy to overlook the frequently smarmy plot developments and enjoy the performances. Parker is particularly good, especially when she unwinds by lip-synching to Elvis Presley's "Jailhouse Rock." The soundtrack is nicely compiled, too, and features performances by the likes of Sarah McLachlan, Bonnie Raitt, The Indigo Girls, and Annie Lennox.  Brian W. Fairbanks 
 I don't know a mood this CD fails to convey.  From the sprightly Dusty Miller and Lots of Drops of Brandy to the mournful May Morning Dew to the exquisite Planxty George Brabazon to the hilarious Jack of All Trades and An Poc Ar Buille, it's all here.  And the exquisite musicianship and artistry of all of these incredibly blessed performers shines in every note 
 Before you read Reliquary, you should read Relic first.  It is definitely a page turner, I couldnt put it down.  This is only the 2nd book I've read by Preston and I will definitely buy more.   
 Dylan said after he recorded his 2 acoustic solo albums (Good As I Been to You and this one), critics wrote him off, saying he was done.  He said it make feel so free and alive in a way he hadn't felt like in years.  From now on, he could do just what he wanted.  When Dylan toured in the 70's and 80's, he did mostly older material, with occasional new songs.  On his current tours, he does whatever he wants for the most part, similar to the Grateful Dead and Phish, who did whatever song struck them at the time.  While grunge was exploding, Dylan does 2 solo acoustic albums of old folk and blues standards.  That's a beautiful thing.  Dylan is always at his best when he follow his own voice.  The songs here never date.  They're incredibly haunting, and they're all brilliantly performed.  Thanks, Bob...  
 Edwin Black has done it again, placing 7,000 years of Iraqi history into extraordinary perspective, reminding us of the truth and revealing the newly discovered facts to create an indispensible chronicle of that troubled land and its relation to Britain, France and the United States. That said, the book is really devoted to the last 150 years, when the importance of oil sprang upon the world and Iraq slowly rose to the top of the western nations' agenda as the greatest petroleum source of the new 20th Century. Black's access to heretofore secret oil company archives and his resurrection of forgotten military accounts reveals that Iraq has been desired by the west only for one thing: oil. This book changed my entire thinking and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to understand how we got into Iraq and whether we can ever get out 
 Five Spooky Stars! Where has this one been hiding? Mystery is the key here in this independent film and there's plenty of it right up to the very wild end. This film is somewhat in the area code of NIck Cage's "Red Rock West" at the beginning, but it goes in another direction after it gets going. Then what started out as a quirky film kicks it up a notch and becomes a really weird, enjoyable, and special DVD.    Premise: an out of work actor has huge bills, needs a job, and gets way more than he bargains for when he's offered work by a neighbor: because it leads him out into "the big empty". Can't give any more clues without the possibility of ruining it for you. My advice is to see it twice because you'll never see all of the clues the first time through. The second time through, the clues are like glowing neon lights.  The cast list may be misleading: you may not recognize some of the names, but you'll instantly know the faces of this wild ensemble. Jon Favreau is great as the lead. Sean Bean is wonderfully creepy, and Jon Gries, Adam Beach, Melora Walters, Gary Farmer and the rest of the crew are excellent. Kelsey Grammer is a surprise who adds alot of big name credibility to the movie. And, trust me, Rachael Leigh Cook gets my vote as flat out one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. And there is one surprise actor that you won't recognize until the credits are rolling, which may prompt you to hit the reverse button fast. Incidentially, the first scene between Jon and Rachael is a real "hoot" that may slip past on the first viewing. Pay attention!  This movie, which went direct to DVD, is a wild ride and it's a keeper. It is exactly the type of discovery that many of us movie viewers look forward to, and when we find it, it's really a magical couple of hours that stick in the mind for years. Buckle up, this'll spin your head around. Check your Blue Bowling Balls at the door, please !! Five Mysterious Stars!!  (Note: "The Big Empty" (I love that title) is a great example of what independent film-making is all about. And this is why well-known actors give their time and talent for 'scale' wages: the results can be spectacularly satisfying for everyone involved on a level the public will never truly understand. 
 The book provides a new look at how we view debt vs. equity.   I found myself forced to re-think my beliefs about the security of equity. The only negative comment that I have on this book is that it is primarily focused on US tax legislation. 
 Great book! Clearly written and relevant. Easy read - Great follow along photos - wonderful descriptions of the exercises 
 I'm so pleased to see this title back in print. I read it, and re-read it, and re-re-read it many times as a young teen. And I owe this book the credit for my two precious children, who joined our family shortly after their births. 
 What a warm gift.  Thanks Faith!!  This CD was well coordinated and crafted.  The kind of CD you bake cookies, cut greens, make pies, kiss and hug family, kids, while playing.  
 `In America' is a truly touching and beautiful film, elevated by strong performances by everyone involved.  The film centers on a poor Irish family that, after the tragic death of their 5-year-old son, illegally move to New York's Hells Kitchen and try and start a new.  The family consists of parents Johnny and Sarah (Paddy Considine & Samantha Morton) as well as their two daughters Christy and Ariel (Sarah & Emma Bolger).  Johnny is trying to make it in the world of acting, and they struggle as he fails audition after audition.  Their apartment is just about condemned, all their neighbors are crack addicts, and worse yet Sarah has become pregnant again and her condition is far from perfect.  In the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light.  That light is found in Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who, while appearing to be reclusive and mean actually lets his guard down with this family and becomes a friend.  It all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first Halloween in the states.  No one is paying them any mind as they trick or treat throughout the building, but Mateo is softened and opens the door for a friendship all parties needed.  As the film progresses and we learn of Mateo's condition, their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some.  They need each other.  The final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter Christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes...one of happiness mixed with sorrow.  This is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion, from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness.  As you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you've known them your whole life.  This is due mostly to the impressive cast.  Samantha Morton hands down delivers the finest performance here.  I only feel that if the academy had placed her in the right category (she was above all things `Supporting') she may have beat out Renee for the golden statuette.  Regardless, her performance was harrowing.  She captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through, and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping.  Djimon Hounsou blew me away with very little words, but it was Paddy that shocked me, mostly because he was all but ignored come awards season.  He was brilliant and deserved some recognition.  His grieving father trying to hold his family together in the midst of even more tragedy was heart stopping.  And don't forget these two young girls who played their roles so perfectly you'd swear they weren't acting.  They became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical `cute kids', remaining three dimensional and `real', not Hollywoodized and hollow!   This film is, as many have stated, classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone.  It's very rare you get to enjoy something that exuberates perfection on every level, and this film, this rarity, does just that.

 This book is the last book written by James Herriot - actually James Alfred Wight (1916-95). James, a native of Glasgow, Scotland, qualified as a veterinarian at 23 years of age, and quickly fell with his new location of Yorkshire. Beginning in 1970, James began to write books, reaching into his years of experience as a vet, and spinning out enthralling and entertaining stories of things that did happen and things that might have happened on the Yorkshire Dales.  As I said, this book was James's last, being published in 1992. In it, we read adventures of a country vet, doing battle against disease, hypochondriac pet-owners, uncooperative animals, the weather, other vets, and...just about everything. This is another great James Herriot - All Creatures book, one that I loved as much as the earlier books. If you like good storytelling, or are interested in veterinarians, then you will love this book. It is a gently humorous story that is sure to entertain all. I highly recommend it!  
 On the basis of this book Carlo Levi became one of my favorite authors, along with John Berger (most of whose books I've read and reread), Haldor Laxness and Carlo Ginzburg. Levi describes the kind of people that my wife and I are continually searching for in our wanderings on foot, 'originals'. Maybe D. H. Lawrence should have gone to Gaglianao instead of looking around in Tuscan graves 
  The civilization does not suppress the barbarousness ; it improves it . This bitter thought of Voltaire is extraordinary appropriate for this film . Once more Szabo shows all his over gifted powers in this genuine expression of the exquisite cinema art in this epic drama around a Budapest family struggled to survive the antiSemitIsm that permeates the successive generations . Magnificent job of recreating the details of the Ancient Austrian Hungarian Empire , nazi and Communist in Hungary .  Ralph Fiennes shows us once more why he is on of the best  world actors in the world . he plays three different roles - father , son and grand son in that family . This story has been told too many times before but you know what it happens when a genius finds a material ; he transforms it giving amazing results. 
   WITH EVERYONE SINGING STANDARDS (EVEN ROD STEWART) IT IS VERY REFRESHING TO LISTEN TO THESE SONGS BY ONE OF THE "ORIGINALS" OF THE ERA. JO STAFFORD'S VOICE COME THROUGH WITH VERY HIGH QUALITY IN THESE REMASTERED RECORDINGS. I WISH I COULD SEE HER PERFORM LIVE. 
 I bought this for my daughter when she was young and it was slightly torn up.  But now she's 5 and she asked if we could replace it because she loves how the pop-ups are so cool!  A definite keeper!  Wendy from Noblesville, I 
 seeing that this is such a small book (barely 100 pages of text), i was surprised at the depth of this book. as one reviewer wrote, it does not get into specifics about his life ('journeys' by allen shawn is good for that), but it gets into enough. i was especially pleased with the musical analysis of schoenberg's music that was presented here, which those who understand music can appreciate; such is left out of many musical biographies that i have read, and that is why i appreciate it here. it does lend a tremendous assistance in understanding his music, and his working philosophy. (that said, though, it might mean that this isnt the book for you if you dont want to get into theory; again, shawn's book is an excellent alternative then.)in fact, after reading this, i started to read schoenberg's writings on music theory, which ifound enlightening. 
 This book is more than a cookbook. Each section describes the setting, purpose and the details about the ingredients used. It is a history book, too. Even 'tho we have quick and easy ingredients, Edna beleived in doing things from scratch and the fresher the product, the better. Wonderful reading. The Parker House rolls and the Sweet Potatoe Pie are awesome!! 
 Expertly written by award-winning drama critic and biographer Martin Gottfried, Arthur Miller: His Life And Work is the exhaustive and superbly presented biography of the award winning American playwright, and knowledgeably examines his life and his theatrical creations in close detail. A wealth of information and insight into one man's life and his timeless, century-defining plays set Arthur Miller: His Life And Work quite apart among notable and worthy biographies. No academic or community library American Theater History or American Biography collection can be complete without the inclusion of Arthur Miller: His Life And Work 
 Dr. Kilpatrick's new book, Celluloid Indians, is a breathtaking account of Native Americans as portrayed in film. Her solid scholarly work is made accessible to readers of varying backgrounds.  The subtle humor, sprinkled  thoughout the book, enhances its appeal and makes this one very good read.  I highly recommend Celluloid Indians to anyone who is even remotely  interested in gaining an increased understanding of the misrepresentation  of Native Americans in film. Thank you Dr. Kilpatrick 
 I have never laughed so often or as loudly while reading a book as I did with Dog of the South. Comically absurd, almost surreal in its presentation of oddball events and characters, it is a joy to read. Don't let this one get away 
 from good to awesome!  I get the feeling that this is an incredibly personal mix, because it encompasses so many different records, emotions, and feels.  That said, the pacing and mixing shows that this mix is composed by a master-class DJ.  This mix is a real journey, as cliche as that term may sound.  Just take a look at the track list, and you'll see the depth of music that is informing Jimmy Van M.  When you can match Brian Eno to Depeche Mode, and Cocteau Twins to Speedy J, you've got something special.  The only complaint I have is that the mix is so personal that certain tracks just don't ring right for me because of differing tastes.  Though for me, this only happens at the end of the Disc 2 in a giant 3 disc set!  So, if you're reading this, I encourage you just to go ahead and buy it 
 Robert Wuthnow is the most prolific and most interesting contemporary  sociologist of religion, delving again into the ambiguous heart of American  spirituality. This study is certainly the most accessible, popular analysis  of religious trends since the 1950s, with a startlingly convincing  interpretation of how attitudes about religion and spirituality have  changed in the post-modern era. Read this and await his next study.  Wuthnow's done a great service to our understanding of what sometimes seems  to be a most perplexing trend from  domestic religion to a kind of  amorphous, inauthentic spirituality of seeking 
 This is an excellent translation of an interesting Viking saga that has many parallels with Beowulf. The original author of this saga is unknown. It tells the story of King Hrolf Kraki's family and how he became king. There are also tales about his champions, their families and how they came to be in the service of Hrolf. This is one of the shorter sagas, only 77 pages, and reads easily. The story is filled with battles, sorcery, greed and deception. There is also an excellent introduction and notes section at the end of the book 
 This book has lots of action. i felt kind of confused with it because the clone wars tv series says that obi-wan kills durge on munnillist. it also said that anakin killed ventress on yavin 4, but in the book it said he killed her on corusant. but over all the book has many suprises and twists. i gave this book a 4 out of 5 
 After having a miscarriage at 8 weeks, and having waited for that pregnancy to happen for 12 years, I found comfort in researching as much as possible about dealing with the pain of my loss. Finding this book has made me realize why I have had so much trouble getting pregnant to begin with. It is easy to read and has a step by step explanation on how to apply the Ancient Chinese Medicine and methods in your life-style to be successfully pregnant... naturally. I strongly recommend this book to anyone in search for the "infertility cure". 
 This was a wonderful book.  It read very fluently and was more captivating than most biographies.  L'Enfant noir is a wonderful example of the movement known as La Negritude, and it is the best French-language book I  have ever read 
 I read this book with a circle of friends as part of our 20 something men's group from church. Though some chapters are hard to read through, over all the message is clear.  God made us all with unique strengths to be used in drawing ourselves closer to Him.  Our God given calling is who we are, it is the purpose of our lives, and who He wants us to be.  It is our only possible path to fulfillment.  This fulfillment can only be reached when it is done for His glory alone. He is our one true audience and no one else.  This book helped me discover what my calling in life is. Now I begin a new chapter in my life thanks to this influential book. 
  In the absence of an autobiography, this collection of 38 interviews and profiles is essential for the Tom Waits fan. It opens with a foreword by Frank Black and an introduction by Mac Montandon.  Part One: Early Years, contains the following amongst many others: The 1974 press release for Heart Of Saturday Night by Waits himself; A short interview with Clark Peterson of Creem magazine from 1978 titled The Slime Who Came In From The Cold; from 1976, there is an article from Sweet & Sour, a long Zig Zag interview and a New Yorker article.  The 1977 Rolling Stone piece by David McGee is very informative and from 1979 there is a short Washington Post article. This section also contains a poem by Charles Bukowski with a short introduction noting that it captures the entire Waitsian world.  In Part Two: The Middle Years, I found the following to be the most compelling: Peter Sabbag's in-depth 1987 article from the Los Angeles Times Magazine, a long formal question and answer interview by Glen O'Brien in a 1985 Spin magazine, 20 Questions from a 1988 Playboy and another question and answer interview from 1989 with Elvis Costello in Option.  Part Three: These Days, offers inter alia the following informative pieces: A 1999 Billboard review of Mule Variations and a short 1999 live review by Jon Pareles from the New York Times. From the same year there is a short review by Luc Sante in The Village Voice and an engaging conversational piece by David Fricke in Rolling Stone. There is also a short question and answer session from a 2004 Vanity Fair.  This section concludes with Nirvana, a 1992 poem by Charles Bukowski. It was included because in an interview with Soma magazine in 2002, Waits referred to this as his favorite poem. The book concludes with a Discography and a Timeline from Waits' birth on 7th December 1949 to the release of his 2004 album Real Gone. The book documents his entire career and is perhaps better than any biography as it contain so many perspectives from so many different writers.  
 enchanting style, captivating characters, provocative injustice, sweet romance, magical realism, intriguing conspiracies -- this book has everything that I could ask for in a novel! This story bridges the gap between fairy tales and naturalism; breathing life and unpredictability into the world of fantasy 
 E.F. Benson, perhaps best known for his amusing 'Mapp & Lucia' comedy-of-manners stories also wrote a respectable body of ghost stories which are gathered together in this excellent omnibus anthology. All make for quality reading as examples of the English supernatural genre but a few stand out as darkly-luminous masterpieces, unforgettable in their haunting hold upon the reader and written with real verve. 'The Room In The Tower' is an undeniably chilling narrative of vampirism featuring a truly terrifying female revenant - the words spoken recurrently by Mrs Stone to the protaganist: "Jack will show you to your room: i have given you the room in the tower" are enough to instil a frisson of pervasive dread every time one reads this story. 'The Sanctuary' is a delectably macabre tale of damned souls and secret diabolism at an English country house complete with a hidden Satanic chapel for nocturnal celebrations of Le Messe Noir. 'The Man Who Went Too Far' unfolds by awful degrees the seductive but injudicious immersion of an artist in the deeps of nature mysticism which can only culminate in the most hideous revelation of truth and the sign of the cloven hoof - it is marvellously written, exquisite prose and descriptive passages and has a most beguiling undercurrent. 'The Cat' likewise is utterly engrossing and 'Mrs Amworth' stands as a unusual classsic of the vampire tale. But these are just a few of the delights this packed volume offers to the curious reader, there are many other marvellous tales to cause one to look over one's shoulder as the clock strikes twelve and a sighing midnight wind scrapes the twigs of an overhanging bough against the window. Quintessentially English, wrought with a delicious lightness of touch and a hint of a stylish insouciance but nevertheless conveying a genuinely disturbing charge of the uncanny these tales will be read again and again. E.F.Benson's contribution to the field of supernatural terror is of a very high standard. This anthology is well-worth obtaining 
 The Devil's Hatband is my first Robert Greer novel.  A friend who reviews for a California-based magazine told me about him since she knew I'm interested in the mystery genre.  CJ Floyd is a character that gets to your  heart.  I know some folks like their detectives (CJ's a bounty hunter, but  you'd just as well call him a detective) hardboiled.  CJ is tough but also  a thinker.  I like that. Mr. Greer wrote a very believable tale about the  cattle industry in a time when a comment from Oprah can throw them into an  uproar.  I never realized how cutthroat the cattle business could be.  And  Mr. Greer peopled his novel with memorable folks like Billy Delong, Dittier  Atkins and Morgan Williams broken down ex-rodeo cowboys whom I hated to say  so long to.  And Mavis, CJ's on-again, off-again lady who had HIS number  but still liked to call sometimes.  Fresh, lively and thoroughly  entertaining.  I'm ordering the other CJ Floyd mysteries 
 This is another fun book from the world of psychology by the author of "I Know This Much Is True". Actually, it's Lamb's debut novel, and a very well written one at that. "Undone" is the story of fat girl Dolores and her 40-year search for happiness in the midst of family breakup, mental illness and loss.  The most memorable part for me was Dolores's diet where she finally conquered her eating addiction by imagining that all her food was spoiled and covered with mold--a lot cheaper and likely more effective than the current range of diet fads 
  "The Dark Corner" has a great noir opening scene in a dank private investigator's office, hard by grim elevated subway tracks in New York City.  The P.I., Mark Stevens is an embittered ex-con, set up by his former partner, Kurt Kreuger.  A seedy guy in a white suit, William Bendix, attempts to bait Stevens into going after Kreuger, who conveniently enough, now lives in New York! The whole deal is a scam artfully arranged by a slimy, oily, effete Clifton Webb in the "Laura" tradition. CW wants KK murdered for messing with his wife, played by icily attractive Cathy Downs.  CW wants Stevens-via the slimy Bendix- to take the bait! Stevens is supported throughout by a devotedly loyal secretary, Lucille Ball- THAT Lucille Ball. Some may be reminded of Ella Raines in "Phantom Lady". What happens will not be revealed here-good reviews don't give away resolutions. Is justice done? Does anyone live happily ever after? Folks will just have to watch DC, but those who do should not be disappointed. The cast here is first rate. True enough, all have won higher accolades elsewhere; this reviewer will forever remember Downs' performance in John Ford's classic brooding western,   "My Darling Clementine".  The strong performances pull DC along.  The chemistry `twixt Stevens and Ball is smoothly rough in true noir fashion. The two were never paired again. According to Silver and Ward's "Film Noir", DC is Ball's only noir credit and Stevens made only 2 other f.n.flicks.  The bottom line is that the small parts of DC are worth more than the whole, even if it's neither the greatest of detective stories, the best work of the cast nor the best of noirs.  Viewers should enjoy watching a professional cast directed by veteran helmer Henry Hathaway perform. Recommended! 
 Best product I've ever found for taming my wavy/curly, fly-away hair, without having to straighten it.  I can just put in a dollop after washing, blow-dry the roots and then let it be.  Works in humid and dry conditions.  For extra body, finger curl locks while wet 
 This books gives an excellent background to elementary number theory. I've found this book gives lots of examples, theorems that are helpful with interesting excercises. What I do find frustrating is that here and there the methods given are innefficient compared to what my proffesor teaches in class. As well some of the proofs are written as one giant run on sentance, and written line by line. This is VERY hard on the eyes and totally annoys me. 
 The Johnstown Flood is a powerful work of historical writing that brings us to a time and place far removed from our present world.  Johnstown was an isolated city, built and populated by working class people.  Some got rich from local steel mills, but most remained solid working class.  The population came from many places - especially Europe.  However, all people seemed to work together for the betterment of their own lives.  Then a major flood occurs that defies all boundaries between people, leaving both the rich and the poor devastated.  Outsiders were blamed for the destruction, yet rebuilding started immediately thanks to donations from average people both in the United States and in Europe.  Wait a minute - this sounds eerily familiar.  Can we say World Trade Center?  Can we say New Orleans (Katrina)?  Can we say Miami (Andrew)?  Can we say...  This is the power of this book.  It describes a disaster that was tied to time and place and yet it is very relevant to the way that we still deal with disasters today.  The more things change the more they stay the same.  The Johnstown Flood is very well written.  David McCullough's books are always very engaging, and this one is no exception.  It is a real page turner and well worth reading. 
 I am a George Smiley fan, and really enjoyed the second novel in his fight with his Russian counterpart, "Karla."  I love to be "kept in the dark" and fed a little at a time by le Carre, as Smiley does with Peter Guilliam.  You have a sense that Smiley has formulated his opinion of what is happening, long before the proof is actually revealed 
 No dummy wrote this book. It is an exellent resource.  One giant plus is all of the Hebrew letters are distinguishable.  In several other resources I have bought, the Hebrew is too small to read and learn to write.  If you want a good source that you can actually read and learn to write from, buy this 
 Much like Johnny Cash's American Recordings series, with their innovative yet vintage country sound, Loretta Lynn has come out with the best original work by a country artist in years.  Aided by Jack White of the White Stripes and with a great band backing them up, this album doesn't have a skippable track on it.  The lyrics are vintage country, telling beautiful yet tragic and epic tales, possibly from Loretta's past but mostly in keeping with the country tradition of singing about love and loss.  But the addition of Jack White's recognizeable guitar playing style makes for a Loretta Lynn that is virtually unrecognizeable yet also very familiar to our psyche.  If you are to own any country albums, this is the one you should get 
 I am someone who has to think twice on which is the business end of a hammer, but after reading this book I am nearly to a point of conversion on wanting a new hobby.  In a delightful, light, humorous tone, Brooks and Hill give step-by-step instructions on how to build a glued-lapstrake wooden boat. The book has a drawing or a photograph on practically every one of its 270 pages.  Useful drawings and graphics and notes for how to do hundreds of steps pop up every other page.  Clever ways to do things, jigs you can build, tools you can construct yourself, serendipitous discoveries, and hints and tricks and lessons learned from their own mistakes appear in jaw-dropping detail throughout the book, shared in a reassuring "don't worry, if we can do it, so can you!" tone.  Brooks and Hill obviously have great senses of humor and untold amounts of patience and resourcefulness which they transmit to the reader, page after page, from the beginning of the project to the bitter end of painting, varnishing, installing hardware, and even launching.    Brooks and Hill seem to have anticipated every spot in the process where a builder might encounter a pesky problem or where goofups are common.  They are there ahead of time to warn of the potential problem, and they're there after the fact with a fix-up if the goofup occurs anyway.  This advice has to be worth its weight in gold, considering the number of complicated steps involved.  I am not a religious person, but just knowing that there is a paragraph in this biblical work on what I can do if my keelson warps or how I can fix it if my spiling pattern for the sheerstrake curves out into free space gives me spiritual  reassurance.  Read it yourself and see if you don't feel just a little better about the state of the world -- even if you never build a boat!                       
 For a small book, "Enchiridion" packs a huge punch.  The trappings of life may have changed immensely since Epictetus's time, but human nature remains essentialy the same. We still all too frequently get worked up over things we cannot control, or throw our hands in the air and refuse to make changes which are plainly within our ability. This book, then, reminds us of the futility of those behaviors and the necessity, instead, for some clear-eyed realizations.  Its lessons are simple but effective: some things are within our control, and some things aren't. It is foolish to get worked up over things which aren't in our control. Usually we aren't disturbed by events, but by our opinion of those events.  Taken together, these and other simple lessons offer a path to serenity and peace of mind at odds with, but far more pleasant than, the myriad anxieties of modern life. As a Christian, I found it perfectly complemented Jesus' Sermon on the Mount teachings about avoiding worry and retaliation. (I happened to read it while going through a career transition, and what could have been a turbulent and traumatic experience instead went rather smoothly, without the bitterness and hard feelings one might have expected.) Still, I think people from all belief systems will find themselves richly rewarded by its teachings.  This particular translation has its merits and quirks. Personally, I liked the rather brief introduction and the relative paucity of supplementary materials. Great books should stand or fall on their own merits, rather than on the blovating opinions of modern-day commentators. On the other hand, I didn't enjoy the translator's parenthetical explanations of words and phrases peppered throughout the text. They disrupted the flow of the reading and weren't always terribly necessary.  Still, I can't complain, for this book appeared at exactly the right time in my life, and it came with the exact advice I needed. If, like me, you frequently think you know everything, pick it up, and learn something 
 In spite of the fact that I had to skip a few very boring pages here and there - for the most part I enjoyed this story of Alex dealing with duty and honor verses following his heart to the only women he has ever loved Lauren Hill - the beautiful country miss that is all he has ever wanted in a woman -- I especially give high praise to Hannah Alex's mother - so often the mom's of this era are potrayed as stodgey mean and nasty only caring about tradition and family - this mother actually wanted her son to know love and be happy!!  Looking forward to the other books in this series 
 You will keep this book close by!  The wealth of photos and illustrations provide a visual reference which is both quick and comprehensive.  With well over 200 terms clearly illustrated and defined (many including pronunciations) you'll find yourself reaching for this book time and time again.   The consise history of Classical Order simply explains the developement of an architectural element we have all but taken for granted.  The Lexicon section came in handy the very next day when I used it to show an employee the difference between a "muntin" and a "mullion".  He understood immediately because it was clear to see in the text.    No longer will you wonder what some detail "should" like like, it's right there in the book.  The Do's and Don'ts sections clarify immediately the differences between details which are well done and those which are "Git-R-Done".  I'm thinking of getting an extra copy to keep in the truck 
 Is it a myth that Black men are more hung than White men?  Do White men possess "penis envy" because of what is purported to be a myth? In the grand scheme of things, does size really matter? And if it does, whom does it matter to most? Author Scott Poulson-Bryant discusses these and other questions concerning Black male sexuality in HUNG:  A Meditation on the Measure of Black Men in America.  Amusing and sometimes chatty, this book delves heavily into the discussion about why people are so caught up in the size of the male penis.  Men, White and Black alike, sometimes subconsciously use the penis size as a measuring point for their own sexuality.  White men, the author reports, sometimes develop an envious nature when it comes to Black men because of their fixation on the "hungature" a Black man has.  He traces this back to the slavery era when Black men were hung because of the perceived sexual threat to White women as White men saw it.     Some Black men, to a certain degree, use penis size to measure their own success.  From the childhood games that little boys play to the locker rooms they share as adults, Black men are checking each other out to see how they measure up. And yes, men do check each other out.  Mr. Poulson-Bryant even relates a humorous story where a Black male didn't get any respect until his comrades discovered he was well endowed.  The author also covers how women relate to this issue as well.  Surprisingly enough, this matter also causes quite a stir in the gay community.    The author provides an entertaining as well as interesting dialogue on the fixation America seems to have on phallic size.  He provides this discussion through engaging accounts of his true-life experiences and those of people he has interviewed.  He relates many stories about penis size as well as the idiosyncrasies encountered by various races and the stereotypical presumptions shared in the entertainment industry because of it.  Unfortunately, it is nearly all stories.  There is just a smidgen of history on the subject as he covers a multitude of areas where this discussion has reared its head (pun intended). His sources are almost all friends or acquaintances and a few celebrities, some of whom are gay and many of whom have been given other names to protect their identity.  At times I wondered if this was really about the Black man's legendary member size or Scott Poulson-Bryant.  Whatever the intent, this discourse, I'm sure, will inspire some very interesting debates on the subject.  Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbon (... 
 While curiosity about the occult and the supernatural pervades our society, the devil's best defense has been the successful delusion of mankind into thinking that the kingdom of darkness does not really exist. Consequently, there is a widespread ignorance about the evil power, even among Christians. Many churches that preach the existence of Satan and demons do not acknowledge that people need help and deliverance. John Dawson's experience and the word of God lead to another conclusion. John Dawson presents a spiritual and systematic way of understanding and dealing with the kingdom of darkness that tend to block the progress of the Kingdom of God in an urban area. He states these problems and offers a strategy for faith and intercessory prayer. In the fourth section, Mr. Dawson deals with the subject of crossing the Jordan to take the land. Christians were born to fight the spiritual warfare. Mr. Dawson challenges us to catch the demonic arsonist and bind the demon with God's power. He provides us with a theology of the unseen realm such as the Angels, the evil spirits and the territorial control. With Scripture and fascinating personal testimonies, he shows us the reality of territorial control and spiritual strongholds. Mr. Dawson gives us a five-step strategy for faith and intercessory prayer. This includes worship, waiting upon the Lord, confession, overcoming evil with good and travailing in prayer. This topic challenges our so-called "enlightened" western minds. It is not a scientific book but it is a biblically based theological reflection on the question of spiritual territorial control. Demonic influences affect many in varying degrees and the cities need the Gospel of Christ. John Dawson explains that Christians can take authority over the demonic realm and bring freedom to those that need it so desperately. Mr. Dawson speaks very effectively to a much-neglected aspect of the Gospel in the church today 
 Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.  When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).  On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.   Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.  While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.  A very good read 
 Another reader characterized this work as "space opera." In fact, that's what Baxter has produced here. Much the same way Coalescent was, this book contains two major plot threads, which are (true to his normal style) related. Baxter's understanding of time dilation is keen, and he manages to explain it pretty well without using the typical deus-ex-machina style approach to it as other authors have.   That said, the book does have more or less cookie-cutter characters in it. The characters are all pretty wooden, and are nothing really new to me. For contrast, take some of the characters from Iain Banks' Culture books. While you still have gallavanting space oepra protagonists in the Banks books, there is vast depth to his portrayal (such as Sharrow in Against a Dark Background). However, reading a Baxter book, one has to understand that Baxter is an engineer, and is attempting to explain concepts and ideas, to project what he think a possible future may look like. Not to write a bedtime story about heroes and demons.  To that end, Baxter has done a very good job of taking this series (the Destiny's Children series, not all of the Xeelee Sequence) and extrapolating what seems to be Frank Tipler's ideas into a plausible description of a universe in which humanity is taking over.  Of the three books in the series, I do believe Exultant is my favorite. That's kind of sad, given it's 1500 pages, give or take. However, it's par for the course when you consider some of his other series, such as the Manifold books. It's not the misses which disappoint, it's the "hits" which are truly worth reading for 
 This book is valuable in that it goes far beyond the conflict within the Baptist Church itself. It goes to the struggle over the very soul of Christianity. As emphasized throughout this book, nothing causes the decline of Christian churches faster than the undermining of the Word of God by theological liberalism. Witness the virtual disappearance of significant Christian practice and influence in western Europe. In this book, Criswell is perceptably cited (p. 81) in pointing out that the onset of theological liberalism, as exemplified by the so-called higher critical approach to the Bible, quickly led to a precipitous decline in church attendance, conversions, prayer meetings, missionary activity, etc. Worse yet, theological liberalism, or modernism, is often disguised with euphemisms such as "theological moderates". But Criswell (p. 84) is quoted as saying, "A skunk by any other name still stinks". Very well put 
 I used this book with students to consider German responses to the Hitler years. Wolf writes in a way that does not allow the reader to remain passive (which upset some students who wanted the author to do all the  work) nor does she allow the Hitler years to become an object of the past  (which would allow contemporary readers to remain uncritical of their  present society). She wants the reader to consider current issues by using  her particular childhood as springboard for thought. Wolf places German  suffering in its proper context. She acknowledges that many Germans  suffered but she never allows the reader to forget the greater suffering of  the Jews and other victims of Nazi hatred. Most remarkable of all, Wolf  does not paint herself as a childhood hero bur rather as a typical German  young person of the time. She reminds Germans that Germany was  responsibility for the war. She also makes it clear (by quoting articles  from the local newspaper) that Germans knew far more about the horrible  events than they later admitted. This essential book needs to be available  again. I have a Ph.D. in German literature and read Wolf in German, but  those without German must have this work too 
 I have been reading this subject and studying to further my own spiritual progression for about 25 years.  This is absolutely the best book I have read in many many years.  I have passed my own copy around and I have bought other copies and gave as gifts to special people.  Every single person who has read this has told me they just couldnt put it down!! Without a doubt - buy it 
 If you like games, this one is pretty good.  It is easy enough for kids, but fun for adults too.  The rules are somewhat vague, but pirates don't really need rules, do they?  I mean, they are more like guidelines than actual rules.  
 If you intend to be serious about manual photography, you'll need to have an understanding of the zone system. And if you intend to have an understanding of the zone system, this book is for you. While not  circumventing the science of the zone system, Carson Graves prudently  focuses more on application of its principles. Basically, this book will  give you a clear understanding of what the zones are, how to relate them to  real-life objects, how to understand what your light meter is telling you,  and a lot more...Do ya like pictures, Sonny? This book is full of 'em! The  technical points about previsualization, judging contrast, etc. are really  driven home by informative photos, drawings, and graphs. On top of the  basics, Mr. Graves "takes it to the hole" when he deftly explains  advanced stuff like finding your exposure index and adjusting your  development times...This book is an easy (an educational) read with just  enough seriously technical stuff in it to warrant flaunting it in front of  all the ladies (or guys) to show them what a brainiac you are. But YOU  would never do that, you're way too cool...  All jokes aside - this book  will give you knowledge, and through knowledge, control. Don't miss it 
 This book will change what you thought you knew about gov't and special interests.  Everyone thinks the gov't has always been controlled by special interests, but most don't understand how deep the connection is.  And how long religion and oil(whale and from the ground)has controlled and steered this country from it's inception.  This is not a politically motivated book, it's a "history tends to repeat itself" book.  You will definitely learn a ton from this book.  Top notch, but definitely not a optimistic view of the fate of the United States. 
 This book shows the history of personal computers, from the early build-it-yourself Altair kits, through 8-bit systems like the Commodore VIC-20 and 64 and even later systems.  It displays some computer systems most of us have never heard of, along with great pictures of attachments, device ports and the systems themselves.  If you have any interest in the history of personal computing, this is a great reference 
   A well-written step-by-step guide for refitting a sailing vessel.  The photographs were excellent.  Mr Naujok included many helpful hints on projects.  I had hoped for more detailed instruction on redoing headliner and ideas for modernizing an old interior than what was covered in this book.  However, it is a valuable reference book for do-it-yourselfers 
 Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so. Basil Hallward paints a portrait of Gray - the portrait ages while Gray retains his youth. Standard fare from Wilde full of quotable lines and quips. Flows well with interesting turns in the plot. Recommended 
 IT IS DEEP ROOTED IN THE SUBJECT AND I GAINED IMMENCE KNOWLEDGE FROM THI 
 my printer came last night and i had it hooked up and running in less than a hour on my new imac. Everything works great. super quality on scans and printing. easy to set up on my home network and hooked to my laptop wireless in 10 minutes. great printer and pack of 6 cartiages are under $40 my old printer was over $40 for two   
 i will die if i don't write a review for this thin, slender, sleeve of heaven here on earth of horrors.  well the first album was unspeakably IT and this is the Dolls all matured, hot and bothered...oh it is beautiful and sad and wonderful and so mature and wise and experienced like a true veteran soldier of the vietnam war.  so different from the first album but i feel like i have witnessed an entire career in only two albums...well three if you also count the also must have "Hard day's night"  Gain possession of these three cd's and you will die of happiness and fright 
 If one wants to understand the origins of western culture, particularly the difficult role of the middle ages, then  one could not wish for a more succinct, and I believe accurate and well written summary.  I think Hollister gets it right, we have a large debt to midieval culture.  We are not "Greeks" but a synthesis of ideas derived from these times as modified later rediscovery of ancient Greek thought.  Hollister's writing is superb. He never lost my attention at any time.  He handles the long history and cultural events of this era in a concise yet entertaining manner while  retaining the overall themes that a good history of the period must cover.  I am a general reader of history, not a student 
 This book was captivating from the first page.  I wanted to know what Cece was up to in her latest adventure.  It also brought back memories of my girlhood when I read Nancy Drew.  I could not put the book down or go to sleep till I finished it 
 This episode embodies why I love this series. The bad guy is bad - and makes appearances throughout the series.   And now, this episode offers some more understanding of the Wraith species and actually BEGS you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs.  Now you really don't know what to think...except that today is a day of honor.  I won't blow it for you. Watch this one FIRST if you're not sure about which episode to sample...  and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci-fi adventures.  
 An epic account of the Gypsies.  Although shallow on some details and not current enough in terms of looking at contemporary populations this survey of Gypsy history is an important account.  Although the author does not fully explain the origins of the Romani and he does connect the importance of the `wandering Jew' stereotype to the gypsy phenomenon this book does give a complete account of relations with and among the Gypsies from their original immigration to Europe to the present.  Gypsy's are present in every major European country, and in some eastern European countries they makes up a large percentage of the population.  Poor and wretched the Gypsies are phenomenally misunderstood and understudied, unlike the Jewish Diaspora which is well documented due to Jewish literary traditions and academic heritage the Gypsy's are a people lost to words and a people that deserve books like this one chronicling their ways and customs and plights.  One factual error may  be present in this book, in an early chapter the author assumes the description `Egyptians' applies to Gypsy's, the authors conjecture is most likely incorrect as `Egyptian' probably meant `Arab' or North African muslim.  A minor error that should not detract from the book as a whole 
 I have been using various CD/DVD burners, and sometimes certain combinations of blank media and burners have given me troubles.  I found Verbatim blank media always reliable, no matter which burner I use.  Till a few years ago, Verbatim media were harder to find in retail stores, but these days it is no longer a problem.  Since they are getting cheaper than they used to be, I always end up trying a burner with Verbatim media to make sure the *burner* is not a pooper. You can never tell which is bad if you do this with Memorex media 
  I consider "The War of the Worlds" to be one of the top five science fiction stories of all time. It has been the model for two excellent movies and the driving force behind one of the greatest unintentional hoaxes of all time. The original story is set in England at around 1900 and that has not been altered in this story.   Evans does an excellent job in altering the language to fit current usage while maintaining the integrity of the original story. The abridgment retains all of the excitement of the story and the presentation is suitable for the target level of reader. The illustrations capture the action; I was particularly struck with the detail of the facial expressions.  
 simple & rational way to bit the marke 
 While I can't go into too many reason's why here, I can honestly say that John Grisham's "The Broker" does a very nice job of depicting the rather boring side of being a "spy," no matter what country or cause you work for.  While it's very tense at times, of course, Grisham's portrayal of the day-to-day instruction and endurance it takes to turn a normal, if overly pushy and obnoxious, American into an overly-secretive, spy-like being who dreads being found out is right on target.   In short, successful spying is usually less action/adventure/James Bond than it is rote learning and human insight. "The Broker" captures that, in spades, and mingles it nicely with the political claptrap that IS America's capital city.   Does this make for a great book?  Well, not great, no...but it is very good.  It makes for a tense, at times wrenching, read if you have a brain at all, along with some light romance, self-reflection, and a dry (non-Bondian) sense of humor. It's also, unfortunately, better at the logical, plot-driven tension and espionage than most recent offerings by Koontz, Higgins, Parker, Hiaasen, or Patterson. (More a reflection of them than it is of Grisham.)  All in all, "The Broker" is definitely worth your eight bucks.  Go for it 
 Andrew Feenberg's analysis of technology is profound and liberating.In his theory Feenberg incorporates ideas and insights from Heidegger, Marcuse, Foucault and Habermas among others, but goes beyond them in elaborating an original view. Dr. Feenberg sees technology as value-laden but humanly controlled and develops a historical concept of the essence of technology that incorporates philosophical, social and scientific perspectives. Convincing arguments are made for not viewing technology as a multiplicity of devices separated from the social sphere. "The technical always already incorporates the social in its structure."(Feenberg, 210) This means that devices could be designed to incorporate technical and environmental aspects that would enable liberation and life promoting values, instead of domination. In other words, technology is not autonomous and deteministic, it is possible, through design, to change its social, normative character. The book is clearly written and well organized, easy to read in the beginning, more demanding toward the end. But the chapters are organized to enable the reader to successfully get through the book, which includes many examples and detailed explanations.  	This book is a synthesis of philosophy, history and social thought. At the end of the book you are no longer the person you were before, and your view of technology will be forever changed. You begin to see possibilities where you thought none existed, and connections between things that you never dreamed of! I just finished reading it, and plan to read it again, soon 
 "You Can Heal Yourself" is one of two books that I often refer to for emotional healing and clues into physical illness.  This book helped me personally as I journeyed through depression.  Today it is a useful tool in my toolbox as I often refer to it in my line of work.  This book often reveals needed clues to help my clients find the root of their physical issues.  
 I LOVED this book! I have really nearly all of Tyler's books and this one is definitely my favorite 
 Rizzo is a phenomenal producer, and on this debut release, it shows.  I've listened to this over and over without tiring of it a bit.  Wonderfully layered, gorgeous vocals, lush harmonies, and wonderfully catchy melodies. This is simply beautiful music.  My favorite tracks are Easy Way Out, Amborella, and Travel in Time.  But every cut on this album is awesome.    Put it on a high quality, 2-channel rig.  Preferably planar speakers with thousands of watts of power. And turn it up LOUD.    That's good music 
 This book is a great novel about Dutch occupation of Indonesia. Very interesting and good history presented in novel form 
 Mireille Guiliano does an even better job in this latest book than she did in "French Women Don't Get Fat." While reading, I kept thinking about how many readers will be able to "see" themselves in the kind of unconscious eating/living she describes.  To me, if there is one essential lesson to be taken from this book, it is this: SLOW DOWN and begin to live  and eat CONSCIOUSLY. It won't really cost you anything to do so, and it may just melt some unwanted  pounds from your body. And, if it DOES cost you a little bit more in money, is it worth that to have a LOT more in health, slimness, and enjoyment of life?  Good reading that teaches us a lot about good living! 
 When Josh's stepbrother, Jake comes to visit, Josh isn't feeling happy at all. Josh's best friend won't even come to his house anymore, all because of Jake.

   A dark and dangerous night along the foggy Thames. Lizzie Hexam and her father Gaffer retrive a dead man from the icy waters. During the next 900 pages the name of the victim will be explained. Along the way we will meet such characters as: the nouveau riche family of the Veneerings. He becomes a Member of Parliament entertaining the fatuous Miss Tippins, the timorous Twemlow and an assorted miscellany of rogues (such as the greedy Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Lammle) in high Victorian satire worthy of Thackery in Vanity Fair. The Golden Dustman Mr. Boffin who inherits the estate of the rich John Harmon is a slow-witted old man who gets the infamous Silas Wegg and the antiquarian Mr. Venus to sit with him on long evenings. Wegg reads Gibbons Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire to the old man while seeking ways to discovered hidden treasure in the dust heaps contained on the Boffin property.   Love stories abound. Bella Wilfer who falls in love with John Rokesmith (we learn his identity as the novel concludes) was affianced to the "late" heir of the Harmon estated who is missing and presumed murdered.    Lizzie Hexam is courted by lawyer Eugene Wrayburn and the odious schoolmaster Bradley Headstone who has murder in his heart and lust on his mind.   The novel is dark with fine illustrations by Marcus Stone adding to the pleasures of this three decker.   One lacks the exuberance and joy of the earlier Dickens but in this late work one still marvels at the mastery of the genius of Dickens. Like a black widow spider he has the ability to tie all the plots together in a web of murder, intrigue, mystery and romance.   This 1865 novel will hold your interest; exciting your imagination and keep you up nights in quest of answers to this "novel noire" of long ago 
 This is a good cook book for people who are wanting to cut their fat intake.  I bought this book in 1997, and after using the recipes in this book, along with some other low-fat cookbooks that I had at the time, I managed to lose a decent amount of weight and get healthier.  The recipes are good, my kids even liked them.  Some of the nice features in this book are that each recipe has a shopping list at the bottom of the page, it includes diabetic exchanges, and the book even includes a 14-day menu plan.  I used that plan for the times when I was trying something new and wasn't quite sure what I should serve with it.  All in all, I'm happy with it, and I still use many of the recipes in this book 7 years later 
 a great book thus symbolic meaning of a child innonece reflects the attitude of a lamb who is humble meek and obebient 
 I had a project on Ancient Egypt. We were supose to choose a topic and write about it. I choose King Tut. I borrowed this book at a library and found it so interesting i bought it. I got all of the information i needed  in this book and as a good result a got an A+ on my project. And all I have  to thank is this one book 
 Work Like Your Dog contains some nuggets of wisdom, and lots of advice on how to play at your job, approaching it as if it were a game. I LIKE many of the ideas, such as treating your employees even better than your customers, but I can't imagine applying them in my own straight-laced, uptight work environment. Unless you're the president or the CEO (and perhaps, even if you are), implementing most of the ideas in this book would likely undermine your credibility. For example, the authors suggest things like decorating coworkers old shoes with glitter and plastic flowers, and wearing the "fun" shoes at work. One of the authors attached the metal runner statuettes from all of his running tropies to the roof of his car, creating a "race" car -- and suggests that similar activities create a fun environment. (Yes, but if someone drove such a car into the parking lot where I work, they'd be dubbed hopelessly crazy.) The authors also suggest that acting like a fool in the middle of a heated argument can be particularly effective -- In suggesting ways to turn fights into frolics, they suggest cracking a raw egg against your forehead in the middle of a domestic dispute. Some of the advice is funny -- One Shell trainer created a "swearing room" next to her office, a place where her coworkers could sound off. She then gave prizes for the most impressive swearing (which was "Gods' bees, and scrunties alight!) The book is a fun, creative, quick read. How applicable it is to you & your work environment depends, in large part, on you & your work environment. I'm not sure these techniques would get you very far in a large corporate environment, but they'd be great if you run your own business 
 All I can say about this book is... be sure to check the index. This book is filled with more info than most of us will ever need. The only problem has been finding it. Well, this book has it someplace in its 760 some odd pages 
 I'm almost finished reading this book, and what a long, fun ride it's been.  Wordy, and a little confusing, this book has to be taken in the right mood, or else you'll miss the humor.  The places that the main character travels to are memorable and exciting, and I found myself getting through a hefty portion, without thinking that I had ever started.  Some....no, more like most of the satire is cryptic, and hard to find.  However, I read up on the book, and it immediately popped out at me, and made alot more sense.  This is an excellent book, that I'm sure you will enjoy.  It might even suit as a read-aloud story for younger children 
 Like all of Wilson's other books, this is a fantastic and fun story told in perfect rhyme and illustrated beautifuly.  What's especially good about this book is the surprise ending as well as the humorously detailed illustrations on each page.  It's the detail that makes this book a fun one for mom and to read over and over again, just the way children like 
 I finished this book in two days.  As a Bukowski fan I enjoyed learning about the people he wrote about.  Still, I thought to myself, was Bukowski writing about those people so truthfully or was Sounes filling in the blanks and putting the cart before the horse in his non-fiction.  I very much enjoyed it but had to give it a four because the biographer kept saying that Bukowski was in a stage of his life where he was producing the best poems ever.  Seemed to be that the author was telling us this time and time again in all stages of the life of Mr. Bukowski.  I could never tell what his opinion was about the best poetry done by C.B 
 This guy, Harry Haskell, sure knows his music history. I suppose this book is too esoteric for some, but if you like history and music as I do, then  you'll love this book. I highly recommend it 
 This is a very good compilation of Anne's pop hits, but unfortunately once again two of her best have been omitted: "Walk Right Back" and "Lucky Me".  While both were country hits, they nonetheless crossed over to the pop charts and enjoyed considerable success as pop singles, just like "Danny's Song", "Could I Have This Dance", "Blessed Are The Believers" and "Another Sleepless Night". There is an album of all Anne's hits out there, and hopefully someday soon amazon.com will stock it. Until they do, hold off on your purchase.  Unless of course, you can't wait -- then buy both 
 Please note that most of this review is actually on Heinlein's Citizen of the Galaxy. That's because I was unable to post this review on that product page for some reason, maybe because of a system problem, and rather than delete the review, I thought I would post it here under another one of Heinlein's juveniles. So I apologize for that but hope you will enjoy this review too.  However, I would like to make one brief comment about Time for the Stars. The two main characters are interesting in that Heinlein has portrayed a dysfunctional twin pair who, although not close personally, they are mutually telepathic. Usually, twins are close and almost inseparable, but not in the case of these fictional twins. And when one twin dies in real life, often the surviving twin dies shortly thereafter.  Heinlein started out writing juvenile novels, although sometimes the dividing line between juvenile and truly adult works in his oeuvre is not as simple as is commonly thought. There are a number of these that Heinlein fans are familiar with, such as Rocket Ship Galileo, Time for the Stars, The Star Beast, Tunnel in the Sky, Starman Jones, The Rolling Stones, Podkayne of Mars, and Citizen of the Galaxy. As my fellow reviewer Dark Genius points out, this is probably the most mature of his juvenile works. But they are still notable for containing some of Heinlein's best fiction and ideas.  For example, in Starman Jones, we are introduced to the concept of the cruel and unjust society. In Heinlein's juvenile novels, they are allowed to exist, but in the later adult novels, they are resisted and overthrown. In Starman Jones, we encounter a society of intelligent but violent and carnivorous horse-like quadrupeds who capture and imprison the exploration team sent down to the planet. In this society, the old and sick are not cared for by their family. Instead, they are brought before the tribal chief where they are judged and put to death rather than allowing them to become a burden.  Although Starman Jones was written almost 60 years ago, unfortunately the quadruped culture is not so different from what modern American society has become, in which old people are considered useless and of no value. Contrast our culture with that with China, where the old people are valued for their experience and wisdom.  Getting back to the present book, in addition to the several points Dark Genius discusses, such as slavery, that make this a more adult novel, there are a number of other themes that are more mature, some of which became standard Heinlein fare in later adult works. These include the pervasive corruption of government officials, the odiousness of most governments in general, and their virtually ubiquitous abuse of power. Heinlein feels that such governments richly deserve to be violently overthrown and destroyed down to their very foundations.  Then there is the self-imposed, almost ritual poverty of Baslim, the beggar; the over-regimentation, authoritarianism, and bloodthirsty cruelty of the dominant society; the importance of education and knowledge as power; the moral and ethical obligation of duty and of an unfree citizen to overthrow unjust authority; and many others.   Another interesting idea is the female as the aggressor in initiating a romantic relationship, which Thorby encounters for the first time in the Sisu trading ship--which is actually how things normally work in both primate and human society. :-) And in Heinlein's books, the female is often the more intelligent and educated of the two partners, as in his story Gulf, Mr. and Mrs. Stone in The Rolling Stones, and in the case of Valentine Michael Smith's parents in Stranger in a Strange Land.  Another way to think about the book is that it is basically a Heinleinian, Sci-Fi version of the rags to riches tale, as you watch Thorby's rise from a poor, ignorant, beggar boy to one of the richest and most powerful men on earth. Overall I think Citizen of the Galaxy counts as one of Heinlein's best novels, whether juvenile or adult 
 The review on this web-page says that Ehrman regards the  (proto-)orthodox corruption of scripture as serving a polemical purpose, whereas Ehrman argues that the 'heretics' had their own method of interpretation that was immune to polemics; therefore, the purpose of the corruptions was to re-inforce the commitment of the proto-orthodox to their understanding of Jesus 
 Fisher's message is simple, yet important.  Only great, growing companies create long term value for shareholders.  Fisher's explanation of what makes a great company is a must for any investor.  He is the other half of Warren Buffett, while I like Graham better than Fisher, the wisdom in this book in undeniable.  
 This is a great book--hard to put down.  You get the inside story.  Highly recommended 
 I wanted it for my collection, however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work 
 There are some who complain that this book is unclear or poorly written.  I disagree.  True, it does not spoon-feed the material to you, and you will have to dig a bit on many of the exercises.  It seems to be geared more toward those of us who learned calculus by generalizing the theorems than those who took business calc. and memorized the formulas.  If you want to learn interest theory the easy way, look elsewhere.  However, if you want to get a foundation that will enable you to generalize from basic (that doesn't mean easy!) principles and possibly even do research that will advance the field, get this book.  Be prepared to go over each chapter several times with a pencil and notebook at hand.  The extra effort is well worth it 
 Simone de Beauvoir basically explains the sexual initiation of the female, her relations with the opposite gender, and her place in society, in the style of her classic manifesto of the liberated woman.  As a book published in 1949, Beauvoir's achievement for a woman at her time is really exceptional.. 
 I do not usually write reviews in Amazon.com as I am not really comfortable with the English language. I am not an expert either as Mr. Daniel T. Willingham the reviewer below. I am writing this because I think the review by Mr. Willingham is unfair toward Mr. Levine and his book. Mr. Willingham mentions how Mr. Levine gets a great many things wrong,(when he mentions only  two points that are connected) as if cognitive psychology gets all things right and is the yardstick for theorizing for the brain. I am wondering if Mr. Willingham had read evolutionary psychology their theories about the brain, e.g. mass modularity of the brain, and their confrontation with cognitive psychology. I could not help myself from writing this review when I read "Many of the "processes" that Levine discusses appear nowhere in the scientific literature." What does this mean? If there is not in the scientific literature he cannot write about his thoughts and maybe be correct too (at least for the most part).  Next he writes: "Levine seems to think that he can intuit these fundamental processes through case studies. This is exactly the method used by Freud, and the results are about the same. Freud at least had the excuse that there was not a world of research on the subject that he was systematically ignoring." If Mr. Willingham thinks that Levine and Freud follow the same methods he could read some books on Freud's life and ideas complemented with books from philosophy of science.  Where is the world on research on the subject Mr. Willingham? I would take everything back if you give us prior research on this specific subject. Is this a review from a doleful professor that thinks something like this?  I read all the theory, I did all by the book, I did not put any original theory forward not because I could not think anything new, I have thought a lot of new interesting things but I am still waiting the back up of scientific literature.        :-(  So why Levine is so famous and successful and not myself, I just proved with my review that I am smarter and more careful than Levine.)  Myself I am not a professor but I am not close-minded either and because this book was very helpful to me I gave it 5 stars. 
 Washington Square is a pleasure to read.  Best of all is Henry James' lush prose; his ethereal descriptions of characters and their emotional states and feelings towards others is peerless - and beautiful, and often funny in a stylistic sense.  The novel itself functions as an expostition of human greed and the need for control, physically and emotionally.  The four focal characters are all well drawn, and because of that their more despicable natures come forward.  The naive Catherine; her father, the overbearing Dr. Sloper; his sister, the officious Mrs. Penniman; and the greedy, and lazy, Morris Townsend, ostensibly interested in Catherine only for her, and her father's, money.  There is plenty of scheming and posturing by all four of them, and any more words from me will spoil the novel.  Also amusing, is the dated sensibilities of the characters; but it all adds up to an enjoyable novel by an American master 
 I first read this novel about 35 years ago.  Since then I have enjoyably re-read it several times, each time finding something new.  It is probably one of the most absorbing tales I have read and helps me enormously to relax and enter into the story.  I sometimes 'feel' as if I am on the island with the characters!  My daughter is reading it now - after badgering her for some years to give it a go.  Needless to say she is enjoying it too.  Very witty and so very well written 
 At least for those us who cut their political teeth during the 1960's and 1970's, Watergate and Vietnam were the watershed events. There was life before Watergate and Vietnam and life after. Stanley Kutler's work is one of the first to bring an historian's perspective to the Watergate story. As the saying goes, if you read one book about Watergate, this is the one.  Kutler is by no means neutral on Richard Nixon, but one of the unique things about Watergate was that Nixon's own taping system provided the record to hang himself. If nothing else the tapes proved Nixon was a habitual and flagrant liar. Kutler, whose regular job is as a professor at the University of Wisconsin, was drawn into a lifetime of work by his expertise on the sprawling scandal that was Watergate. His work has continued as he battled first Nixon, Nixon's estate, and then the National Archivists for full access to the White House tapes. Nixon kept up his lies and deception to his last days, with far more success than one would have hoped. In the long run, history's judgment of Nixon will be harsh and will start with Kutler's work 
 I purchased this book for a Reader's Guild discussion group at Goucher College. It's a very quick read about first generation immigrants adjusting to America and Americans as well as great fun to read about places in Baltimore which are described so beautifully 
 one of the most wonderous moments on this album is when the final clang and clamor of "Out of This World" end and the gorgeous ballad "Soul Eyes" begins. words fail. COLTRANE is a masterpiece. every track a standout cut. a brilliant and touching recording that overflows with confidence and joy and displays (again) the seemingly bottomless well of talent from this legendary jazz group. classic 
 Gunstories by Beth Atkin is a book that should be mandatory reading for ALL students and discussed with parents, teachers, and friends. Young people discuss guns in a positive light and a negative light. As with any subject, it is only with EDUCATION and knowledge that a change can be made. I definitely recommend this book and hope that it can be a fixture in ALL elementary, middle, and high schools. (P.s. If you are a school librarian, ORDER a copy!!) - Shelley (Henderson, NV)   A fascinating look at a difficult topic! Many viewpoints are presented, the book is fair and balanced. But the stories of gun violence just naturally have more impact than those of kids who enjoy range shooting. The dichotomy between rural and urban viewpoints is striking. The wonderful photography really adds to the text. Recommended. - Diane (Cedar Rapids, IA)   Despite the fact that I'm not really in support of guns, it is nice to read a book on such a controversial topic that does not carry a political agenda. It's not your typical Pro/Con book either. It gives actual perspectives from real life people...teen people who just want to tell it like it is. - Amy (Fort Worth, TX 
 There is no other story told and re-told as much as P&P.  This book transcends many generations with a true and tested story.  The characters and story line are so similiar to this day and age.  Austen's poetic writing gives readers a sense of the social times as well as insight to each character's thoughts.  I read this book every year and see all the movies based on it.  Love it, love it, love it 
 This album does a great job of accommodating your mood.  It can take the edge off of a tough day at work, or it can compliment a relaxing evening at home.  Walter's version of "People Make the World Go Round" is incredible.  This album is a must-have for your collection 
 I haven't made waffles since I was a kid but I remember what a mess it was back then. The Belgian Waffler proved easy to use and clean. It even has a little 'toot' alarm to tell you your waffle is ready. Easy to use, easy to clean and stands up for easy storage in the cupboard. A great deal at a great price along with free shipping. I definitely recommend it 
 This is an examination of Pilates matt, wall, and floor exercises that is elegantly simple and easy to follow. For those wanting to know about the real deal, and not just the flirty "pilates-a-go-go"  at your neighborhood gym. It is a gold mine of well explained progressions and checklists to follow, including visualizations for mind and breath.     It couldn't be better unless it came with a certified intructor between each page.               I recommend it highly 
 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FIND THIS BOOK "BLAND" BUT SUCH IS TRUE LIFE!  THE PEOPLE WRITTEN ABOUT IN THIS BOOK ARE MY GGG-GRANDPARENTS, THE DE WIT'S.  EACH GENERATION PASSED DOWN THIS INFORMATION TO THE NEXT SO AS TO KEEP THE BOOK ALIVE.  IT'S AN ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF LIFE IN 17TH CENTURY HOLLAND AND THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN ARE SO ACUTELY DESCRIBED YOU CAN IMAGINE LIVING DURING THAT TIME.  IT'S FULL OF TURMOIL SORROUNDING THE POLITICAL NATURE OF THE DAY WITH REAL HEROISM.  IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO SAY I'M A DE WIT DESCENDANT 
 This is a primer for younger teenagers. It is well written, although it needs to be updated in 2006. It is a textbook more than a think piece. It is a good starter book for parents and younger teenagers. 
 Bought book for my 88 year old mother.  The large print enables her to read and the great stories and the humor kept her interested in this book. She really injoyed this book and now I have started reading it also and find it to be delightful 
 Es uno de los mejores discos que ha hecho Ruben, con una musica sublime, y letras inmejorables, cargadas de sentimiento y contenido socio-politico. Todas las canciones estan buenas, todas. En resumidas cuentas, si no tienes este disco, no eres un verdadero fan de Ruben Blades 
 This book is a canonical gay studies text. Halperin is a respected academic in both the classics and gay studies. The term "homosexuality" was invented a little over a century ago. Thus, anything before that time has to be analyzed in perspective. Halperin looks at the classic writings of ancient Greek "homosexuals" and puts them into deep analysis. Halperin avoids a lot of the "essentialist" mistakes that John Boswell fell into with his Social Tolerance book. Dover's book has more cool photos in it, but Halperin's book is very worthwhile. It's a must-have for classics and gay readers 
 If you have never seen his films made in 1950's, you should see them ASAP. You could feel his aggressive and challenging spirit for the movie. The title "Ikiru" means just "Live". This film obviously lets you know what "Live" is. The first time when I saw this movie is 20 years age. In that days there were no video, vcd or dvd player, it was very difficult to see his films even in Japan. But now DVD have been released, How lucky we are! 
 I really like this movie and have been waiting for awhile to get it.It was available from other sellers at an outrageous price and i wasnt going to pay that much.The people who were charging so much in my eyes are a bunch of crooks.If they would have lowered the price i would have maybe bought it.Now they lost out completely as its out again 
 I'll have to admit that my reason for wanting to see Heavenly Creatures was prurient. Anne Perry is one of my favorite mystery writers, and I was interested to see the movie Peter Jackson made about the murder she and her best friend committed as teen-aged girls.   Melanie Lynskey plays the part of Pauline Yvonne Parker, who grows up in a poor family. Her parents were never actually married, and they keep boarders in their home. Lynskey portrays Pauline as a very sullen teen-ager, and deserves much more credit for her portrayal than she has received. Very rarely do you see her exhibit true happiness in this film, and the few times she does, it is always when she is with her friend, whom she sees as the only way she has of excaping her horrible life.  Kate Winslet plays the part of Juliet Hulme, the privileged daughter of wealthy parents. To Pauline, it appears as though Juliet has the perfect life, but in fact, Julliet has a checkered past. Due to constant lung problems, her parents sent her away to live in the Bahamas for five years, leaving her in constant fear of abandonment. She meets Pauline on her first day of school after she and her family move to christchurch, New Zealand, and the two of them strike up a friendship.   Although the movie depicts a lesbian relationship between the two of them, Anne Perry has staunchly denied that they were anything but friends. Indeed, it is not outside the realm of possibility that Perry is telling the truth as teen-aged girls frequently develop "crushes" on each other and have extremely intense personal friendships without any sexual involvement.  What is obvious, though is that both girls were highly imaginative, and they both fulfilled a deep need in each other. Pauline needed to feel as though she were a part of Juliet's wealthy family, and Juliet needed to have someone she could count on not to leave her. Indeed, in one scene of the movie, Juliet has experienced a recurrence of tuberculosis and her parents put her in a convalescent home before leaving to spend several months in England. Pauline and her mother are the only people to visit Juliet during that terrible time.  Juliet's world comes crashing down when she learns that her parents are getting a divorce. Her father is going back to England and she is being sent to stay with an aunt in South Africa. Once again, she will be abandoned by her parents and, even worse, she will be separated from Pauline. Pauline convinces her that if they kill Pauline's mother, the two of them will be able to stay together.  It is sad watching the scene of Pauline's mother preparing to go out for a day's outing with her daughter and Juliet. It must have been one of the happiest days in the woman's life-- her daughter was taking her to tea and then to a park, and then her daughter and her daughter's friend savagely murder her. It is the opening scene of the movie, and the closing scene of the movie.  Peter Jackson does a stellar job of weaving the girls' fantasy world into the real life elements of the story. Although he has taken some liberties with the story, that can be excused as neither of the women involved participated in any way in the making of the film. I can't say that I really enjoyed the movie so much as I thought it was an interesting portrayal of a horrible crime. However, the movie is a superb acting vehicle for a very young Kate Winslet and for Melanie Lynskey, both of whom do a terrific job of portraying their characters. The movie also foreshadows Jackson's genius and his attention to detail that we see later in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  While I wouldn't want to watch the movie again, I am glad that I at least saw it. I've read about the crime and tried to picture the events in my head. Jackson did a terrific job of translating things that I've only read about into reality. 
 I have recently purchased this recently out of print title from the Criterion Collection and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is "The Harder They Come," a perennial cult classic, it is also a surprisingly great movie. It is a film with an all Jamaican cast, shot in Jamaica, with an excellent soundtrack that introduced reggae music to the rest of the world. It stars musician Jimmy Cliff as a young man who moves from the country to the city of Kingston where he faces poverty and depravity, tries to make it as a musician only to ironically become more famous as he turns to a life of crime. What would have easily been a trashy exploitation film is transformed into a thoughtful, artistic, and compelling film of admirable quality. It is also wonderfully acted, but you may need to use subtitles to understand what they are saying through their thick accents. Overall a great film on an out of print Criterion DVD that you may want to pick up 
 Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. I bought this book to read on a flight from the UK to Australia and it had me laughing so loud I was quite an embarrassment! I'm not a 'chick lit' kind of girl but this was a real exception. As an author myself I really admire the talent it takes to write a book where almost every line makes you smile or laugh. Pure escapism, very charming and such good fun, and somehow it also manages to be a book which makes you take stock of what really counts in life. This should be compulsory reading for every workaholic - and certainly every lawyer. Enjoy 
 Although there can only be one "Notebook", Sparks draws you into his stories that makes you want to read them again and again 
 This book is really an awesome book for the subject. I have used it for both research and teaching. There are not too many books that cover the same materials at the levels of focus and depth as this book 
 I just finished knitting the "Sensational Shirttail" from this book, a v-neck aran cardigan. The design appears complicated and is rated intermediate, but it was truly easy to follow the very clear instructions. Everyone who has seen it loves it and is astonished that I, a novice knitter, actually did it all myself, and in less than three weeks! I am ready to begin others sweaters from this book, just trying to decide what colors and types of yarn to use. Oh, another great thing about this book is that it gives you the yarn weight used in the original pattern and the yardage, as well as the needle sizes, so you can adapt to your choice of fiber. I knitted my sweater in a chunky weight cotton, and I couldn't be happier with it. There are so many other beautiful patterns in this book, I'm sure it will appeal to just about every knitter 
 This is one of my all time favorite films.  Fosse only made 5 feature films in his career (Sweet Charity, Cabaret, Lenny, this one, and Star 80), but everyone is a masterpiece.  This is his best film.  It's an autobiographical film about a filmmaker/choreographer who's addicted to work, booze, pills, sex, work, booze, more pills, etc., etc..  It's definitely based of Fosse himself, and it's a rather painful portrait.  Fosse should be commended for admitting (for lack of a better term) that's he's not a great person.  There's no "closure" scenes here, where Joe Gideon (wonderfully played by Roy Scheider, Fosse's alter ego) realises the error of his ways, and makes peace with everyone.  Fosse shows warts and more warts, but in spite of that, the film is amazing.  Brilliantly edited, shot, acted, and choreographed, this is Fosse's best film, one that really defined him as an artist.  Fosse was not a prolific filmmaker, but when he did make a film, it was a masterpiece.  And this is his greatest one...  
 This is a very good compilation of Mozart Violin Concertos and with a very good Orchestra. I did not put 5 stars because I had some of Mozart concertos played by H.Heifetz and other by Xue-Wei that I consider are more brilliant violinsts. Grumiaux is very good but not excelent 
 This book has some great tricks, mostly for me it was more the steps to do the tricks which can be used in other designs. Its a good book to learn about different ways of doing things in photoshop 
 I found the book for the most part useful.  The breakdowns of the missions are very handy.  some of the hints they offer slow the mission down if you use them.  the main reason i bought it was for the maps for the oysters and other little goodies that need to be found.  And this is where it gets a little weak. They use big dots on the map to show where each location is.  well that makes it a little bit of guess work.  it gives you a general location.  the photos they use are also very tiny and sometimes of little use.  but overall the book is good and helpful 
 Well, as I allways do I'm gonna have a bit of retro in my review. I can say that this is the first skatepunk i ever heard that i remember. my brother listenned to it when he was around 16, and now im 15 and ive been a real skatepunklistenner for 3 years. and i love it. this cd really kicks .... im not a hardcore fan of rancid, but this just a feeling has something special, and it is ... great. lets say like this: the songs i dontreally love here might be: (if i had to say it) guns n wankers. otherwise it kicks. and i think that propagandhi got a lovely name on that last song  they had here. homophobes are just pissed cause they cant get laid. this cd is also the reason til why i started listenning to lagwagon and nofx. have a nice lif 
 Why hasn't someone sold a script to Hollywood titled "Trader" about the life of Jesse Livermore? Traders need a new movie, a new classic. We have Wall Street and Boiler Room and Glengarry GlenRoss (OK that one's not about Wall Street but we love it). It's been a while, we are due.  Can you imagine the scene of Wall Street in the 1890's through 1930's? Young Livermore walking into unsuspecting bucket shops and hitting them like a Mack truck? Middle-aged and broke Livermore scraping up a stake together in the form of a small loan and running it into millions - AGAIN? His famous cornering of the sugar market and the brilliant way he liquidated his position? All this interspersed with his disfunctional social life, love of sportfishing from his many yachts, and pearls of wisdom from his trading methodologies?  The proceeds from the DVD sales alone over the next 30 years would dwarf all his made and lost fortunes together...  If you haven't read this book yet you are really lucky because now you get to!  [...].  
 Quite simply, this is an amazing work.  It starts as the book the cover would suggest it is: tightly focused, part Goldwater biography and part tale of the conservative movement's early days.  By the end, however, the story is less Goldwater and the election and far more a sweeping survey of American life in the early 60s.  The campaign fades away, Perlstein masterfully weaves in tales of the civil rights movement, demonstrations, and other events, and Johnson becomes as central to the close of the story as does his opponent.  And this only adds to the impact of the book, since both aspects are written amazingly well.  Following the Goldwater campaign with all its missteps is as agonizing as the wider diversions are educational.  In the end, there is a complete and engaging portrait both of the election and the massive changes in American society that it portended (not to mention how different things are today: the chaos of Goldwater's campaign is utterly surreal in comparison to the machines of current elecitons).  Perhaps most importantly, the book is amazingly even-handed.  Perlstein's politics are obvious, but his observations come across as more therapeutic than enraged, almost seeming to sympathize with Goldwater as he tries to fight off the truly lunatic elements.  It means that Before the Storm is a book that both conservatives and liberals can and should enjoy.  Anyone seeking to understand why politics and society are what they are today should start here 
 One of the few releases in the history of rock that continually delivers the goods, despite massive amounts of critical and not-so-critical raves over 40 years. You could almost say that this album, in the face of all of the good reviews it's received, is underrated. The fuzzy packaging is nice, too, though it's not as fuzzy as I hoped. Heck, I had to find something to complain about! 
 For anyone who enjoys feature writing and investigative journalism this is an excellent read. I have made it through 9 of the 17 stories and have thoroughly enjoyed 8 of them. The topics are broad (John McCain, seal hunting in Greenland, a fat wine critic, campaign finance reform and many more.) The writing is so good that even topics that usually bore me (wine for one) became interesting 
 I had tried many different ways. Suddenly my girlfriend's mother gave me the book as a present and that was it. After reading it, I have not smoked neither had the need to smoke again. The best thing about the book is that you not only quit, but do it easily and painlessly 
 This is Molly Ivins' earliest book, a collection of many of her earliest columns, originally printed in such places as "Ms. Magazine", "The Progressive", and "McCalls". Those of you who have only seen her more recent work may not have realized that she used to be funny; this collection should remedy that situation. It's been years since I've seen a column by Ms. Ivins (who is syndicated weekly in my local newspaper) that earned even a chuckle from me; she's still frequently very insightful, even if I do disagree with her periodically, but she seems to have lost her sense of humor somewhere along the line. This book was my first exposure to her, and is the reason that I continue to at least skim her columns every time: I know what she's capable of. I just wish she'd go back to the style that she used in the columns collected here, rather than the perfectly standard, polite, "civilized" style that she seems to practice these days 
 I found Dr. Grant's work to be well-written and lucid.  If there are those who are willing to criticize his work for not revealing every little detail about the life of St. Irenaeus, it's because we actually don't know much about him above what he wrote and the later comments of other writers - most of them incidental to other conversations.  Grant has collected the essential information about the Bishop of Lyons and has, in my opinion, covered the most interesting parts of "Against Heresies" in his translation.  Recommended for those who are students of early Christian history and heresies.  Irenaeus writes cleanly and it's not too difficult to discover the trajectory of the gnostic threat from his arguments.  In fact, Irenaeus, as noted by Pelikan, is the father of the traditional Catholic/Orthodox/Anglican three-fold authority (Scripture, Tradition and apostolic authority) 
 This book accomplishes two quite different things, both of which should be of use to the committed investor.  First of all, it sets forth an investment philosophy in great detail.  Second, it shows investors how to analyze securities themselves.  In both those respects, it is on a par with "Securities Analysis" by Graham and Dodd (also highly recommended - I have also reviewed that book), although it is a much easier read.  In setting forth an investment philosophy, the book compares well with "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits" by Phil Fisher and "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamen Graham (both recommended).  Whereas Fisher emphasized growth companies and management analysis and Graham emphasized earnings, Whitman and Shubik emphasize low price/book ratios.  They support their position quite ably with examples and , where available, studies.  The Aggressive Conservative Investor also contains a good bit of information about securities analysis.  While it is not as in-depth as "Security Analysis" (the Graham and Dodd classic), the chapters on financial accounting and GAAP are a must read, particularly since the book convincingly demonstrates that the utility of financial statements will differ depending upon the position of the person reviewing them.  Whitman and Shubik are most certainly value investors who focus on analyzing a particular company (as compared to the market as a whole, interest rate trends, etc.), although they also cover "asset conversion investing," which may involve investing in distressed companies.  They make an excellent argument that, in many cases, companies with unencumbered assets may make excellent investments.  They also freely take exception to accounting conventions that emphasize earnings, and they repeatedly demonstrate how earnings may be affected by accounting policies that are beyond the control (and arguably the understanding) of most investors, including me.  Another interesting thing about this book is that it covers different corporate constituancies (banks, bondholders, management, insurance companies, passive outside shareholders, etc.) and how their involvement affects and is affected by corporate activities in great detail.    The book notes that even investors in common stock may have different objectives, and it discusses how these perspectives may affect the company over time.  The book also has an excellent discussion of sources of corporate disclosure, in order to take advantage of the company's public communications to understand it better.  While I am generally aware of many of these sources, the book does a commendable job of explaining them in greater detail.  The Aggressive Conservative Investor does contain some numeric analysis that may be hard to follow, and it can't be called an "easy read," although it certainly is not as hard to read as "Security Analysis."  Moreover, some of the information contained in the book is now outdated due to changes in the tax code.  These are minor concerns to me, however, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about investing 
 Hank Aaron was my baseball hero; I was ten when he hit that famous home run off All Downing.  I knew very little about him as a person, and next to nothing about his struggles during the chase for the home run crown.  I just wanted him to hit number 715. Apparently, that's what he wanted as well.  This book briefly recounts a bit about Babe Ruth, and spends a little time going over Aaron's childhood, upbringing and early career achievements. The bulk of the book takes place between homers #710 and #715, bridging two seasons of baseball.  If there is an "enemy" in this tale...a "bad guy" if you will...it's the entire city of Atlanta, with Commissioner Bowie Kuhn as henchman. The apathy of Atlanta, especially when compared to the obvious respect Aaron gives the town, is inexcusable. Almost unbelievable. The disrespect Kuhn shows is heinous.  Nevertheless, in his own, relatively quiet manner, Aaron does the right thing, graciously and humbly hitting #715, shifting Mr. Ruth into second place on that particular hit list.  I said "relatively quiet" in that it appears Aaron was not afraid of stating what was on his mind. His model for being outspoken definitely was the post-retirement Jackie Robinson, but he wasn't as inflammatory as that legendary figure. It was as if Aaron took over the reins, so to speak, and continued to fight for "black" rights in a "white" game. I don't think it's accidental that around the time of these events, we finally started getting black managers in baseball...and I find it interesting that several of the ballplayers for which served as mentors have now become some of the best managers in the games, like Dusty Baker, Felipe Alou...  The reason I give this book "only" four stars is that the writing could have been better. More elegant. More vivid. Just "more". Maybe it's not fair that I am comparing this book to those written by Halberstam, Kahn, Angell and the other greats of baseball literature and journalism, but there you go.  This book still will have a place in my library of baseball books, and it should in yours as well 
 Diefendorf's work shines as an excellent book on the battle between the Catholics and the Hugenots in 16th Century Paris.  She has clearly done a lot of work on the subject.  While the book can be long winded at times,  she tries to keep the reader interested with many anecdotes.  Truly a  fantastic work.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in  Calvinist or Catholic history or to anyone interested in French history 
    Do you like books where people get lost and have to find there way back? This is like that except it's a dog that gets himself lost. Bowser's chasing Old  Man  Coyote and gets lost.  Blacky  tries to help Bowser get back to Farmer Brown's house.This bookis recommended for dog lovers and animal lovers too.                                                 By                                    Spencer                                               
 I really enjoyed this book.  While not quite as immediately riveting, such as the case with Beggars in Spain, this book gradually drew me in.  After reading it a second time, I found an even richer story.  I think I've read this book four times now over the past six years and have enjoyed it each time.  I find it amazing how Nancy Kress is able to create these true to life characters in situations that she creates and makes real 
 For any of you who like pop, and you like rock, you will not find a better CD to listen to. I know the band personally, and cannot think of a better group of guys to put something this good out. The music is catchy, the lyrics are powerful, and the band overall is incredible. Even if you've never heard them before, buy the album, I promise you won't be disappointed 
 Poirot is given a case by his old pal Spence which takes him to a small village, where the fussy detective must unravel clues behind a crime in which the main  suspect has already been arrested and sentenced... Hercule's indignities at the run down boarding house he's staying at make up the bulk of the story's humor, but the mystery is great fun, too and I doubt anyone can guess the killer, unless you're paying amazingly close attention. The characters here are some of Agatha's most entertaining, and Mrs Oliver, with her uncanny intuition,  always makes a nice flighty side kick.. 
 This is my favorite Perl book, as this is where I started, and where I go back for refreshers.  I have the Third Edition, and can only imagine that the Fourth Edition is just that much better.  As for it being a Unix only book, I would dispute that, as I learned quite enough about Perl to create scripts for the Win32 port of Perl running on Win 2000. 
   Everyone recognizes that this is a time of visual culture, extraordinarily and in many ways excessively so. The phrase is routinely, and casually, used by many in the media, arts, and even academia. However, there is little comprehension, understanding, or agreement on what this visual culture really is either in terms of a concept or an experience. Dikovitsky steps back from this common use of the term visual culture to try to define and comprehend it by exploring "the history, theoretical frameworks, methodology, and pedagogy of visual culture in the United States." She does this mostly by interviews with college professors in fields ranging from art, film studies, and cultural studies to literature which in one way or another take into account the pronounced and often dominating or suppressive nature of the visual in modern culture. The word "study" in the subtitle connotes not so much Dikovitskaya's study of visual culture--although this is inevitably inherent--as it does the author's chosen task to report how visual culture is being studied mostly in the universities; and along with this answer the question of how it is to be studied so it is understood properly. Without a proper understanding of visual culture, contemporary society cannot be understood properly; contemporary society is a mystery. While not defining visual culture definitively, if this can ever be done, Dikovitskaya's exploration, framing of issues, and probing interviews bring the sprawling, elusive, omnipresent presence and idea of visual culture into clearer focus. Dikovitskaya is a research fellow at the Library of Congress. 
   The novel begins with unexpected violence in Edinburgh, spooling out a dissociated cast of characters who are tied together by the vaguest of circumstances, the result an ingenious, collision-packed adventure. A car accident; an assault on one driver by another wielding a baseball bat; a threatened witness; a young woman who may or may not have drowned; one man bludgeoned to death in lieu of another. All these things happen so fast that no one links them together until one police inspector literally trips over the coincidences.  The cast is varied: the crooked real estate developer now lying comatose in the hospital, victim of a heart attack in a motel room with a paid companion; his over-the-hill wife, quite aware of her husband's financial chicanery and random adulteries, planning her own escape for years by stashing cash in the basement; Louise, the police inspector, whose teen-aged son has turned into a primeval monster with the advent of adolescence; Martin Canning, a reclusive writer with no personal life; "Honda Man", a huge, baseball bat-toting brute; his first victim, Paul Bradley, whose valise contains an artfully hidden pistol; and Jackson Brodie, the unsuspecting hero, ex-cop, ex-PI, recent millionaire, who has come to Scotland with his girlfriend du jour, an actress.  As the bodies multiply, the plot thickens, the reader treated to inside information that eludes the protagonists, who continue to crash into each other like pin balls. There is a certain logic compelling the story line, people's paths intersecting more and more frequently, the threat increasing exponentially until it all comes to a head in one massive conflagration, the major players all on the same stage, the monster in their midst expelled by the least aggressive of them, the shy writer, who, until recently, has spun out more exciting events in his head than the numbing banality of his lackluster days. Although a bit anticlimactic, the ending befits this amusement park ride of geeks, freaks and virtual strangers, all come together in a grand finale. Luan Gaines/2006.       
 Has it been so long? 1998?? This is one of the first books that I reviewed on the internet - I was asked to write it, and made me a John Case fan - This book deals with a fertiliy clinic that has amazing donors - and the plans from the church to stop it. The last page is a catch your breath ending. A stranger in a local bookstore asked me if I'd ever read John Case - he was happy I knew the book. I was proud of that first review - and still like to dabble in writing. Of course books like Case's make it easy - 
 This book is an excellent, easy-to-read and thought provoking work. The words are those of Brother Lawrence, a simple Carmelite who --through conversations and letters to a friend--tells about his spiritual journey and how he learned to practice the presence of God. It is a classic, yet is small (less than 100 pages) and pocket sized so that you can read it anywhere and anytime. I think I will take it with me on my next flight and read it all over again.  A real joy 
 It's now part of literary legend that J.K. Rowling wrote the final chapter of the final book of her beloved Harry Potter series well before she wrote even half the novels.  She knew how the story was going to end, and she said that allowed her to keep a tight rein on the characters, and resist the temptation to let the series spin out of control.  One wonders how Patrick O'Brian was able to keep his beloved characters, "Lucky Jack" Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, under such control over a series almost three times as long as Rowling's.  "The Mauritius Command" is the fourth book in this amazing series, and O'Brian shows a deft command over both his subject matter and his characters.  Often, by the fourth book in a series, the characters start to grow dull.  Not only does the reader get the sense of retrodding the same ground, the author has to somehow overcome the sense that his characters are invincible.  O'Brian avoids both of these pratfalls with apparent ease.  "Lucky Jack" may be lucky at sea, but he finds new and innovative ways of getting in trouble on land.  Now, not only is he ashore with no ship and on half-pay, he must contend with his recently destitute mother-in-law and a brace of twins - girls, no less.  Dr. Maturin arrives with the promise of a command and a daring mission - to take two French-controlled islands off Madagascar.  Soon Aubrey is at the helm of a ship, but in addition to his usual cares and concerns, he must now cope with being a Commodore, commander over several ships, including several whose captains carry several tragic flaws.  These various scenarios allow Aubrey to experience fresh troubles with which he has no actual experience, and wonder whether his old tactics will see him through.  Dr. Maturin continues to grow as a character, as well as in practical significance to the storyline.  In "Master and Commander," he was basically a bystander, an observer of the naval action around him.  Now, his role as an intelligence man (read, spy) becomes more important as he plays a vital role in helping the British governor assume his station . . . including playing a game of propaganda warfare against the French.  Maturin also gets a few chances to practice his amazing surgical skills, breaks a few bones, and is confronted with his "dedication" to opium.  Not quite as funny as previous books (no drunken sloths to be seen), but with a little more action, "The Mauritius Command" is a defining book in this series.  Even though this book, according to some, can be read out of sequence, I disagree since Aubrey's (temporary) promotion to Commodore falls in line with the other books.

 I've been waiting a long time to read a piece of non-fiction that is as beautifully written as this book is.  It is as if Baudrillard traveled to the future, read the first great 21st Century novel and retold the story except that he completely forgot the narrative, and left us with only the protagonist's thoughts.  Sure he missteps a couple of times and you're left with the impression by the end of certain paragraphs that instead of offering the reader a real observation Baudrillard has merely circumnavigated the semblance of one, but where else have you read a thinker as ambitious as to try to convey in such an intimate manner a critique of a culture that doesn't relate to each individual directly as much as it exchanges symbols of communication.  I give this book 4 stars as a first time read due to some of its thornier prose, but I'm sure that as the reader returns to this book he or she will become convinced that it is truly a 5 star achievment 
 Stephen Quiller is a real master of color harmony. I warmly recommend his book. He teaches not only the color theory, but also demonstrates how it works in practice with his own work. Quiller shows how to mix colors in real life and how to find out the complementaries. His color wheel adds the commercial names of hues that one finds in shops, which is quite handy.  Quiller will teach you not to use the "real" surface color of the objects, but to search for feelings and the atmosphere of the ambient. The leaves may be, say, violet and the sky yellow, if that is how you see them.  One thing Quiller misses to point out is additive color mixing like it was used by pointillists. When colors mix in the eye the rules of harmony are somewhat different.   If you are sceptical about brave color mixtures I recommend you to first have a look at Quiller's art at his internet pages. 
 I bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends were busy until X'mas. There were 5 of us and once we started playing, we were all addicted! I have heard from some other friends commented Clue was a boring game, but we all found it fun and challenging! Apart from strict logic thinking, the keys to win were to ask the right question and make a good, well organised notes! Last time we played we had 5 players, so some of us got 4 cards in hand and some got only 3 in hands. That was a bit unfair because the players with 4 cards had more clues in the beginning and so their chances of winning were higher. So we tried in one game to open 3 cards on the table, the game was finished a lot more quickly. But we all found that it was less challenging.  Overall, great game!! Train you brain in logic thinking as much as Sudoku and Mastermind 
 I think money and politics and the threat of lawsuits sometimes affects the how researchers present a therapy or drug as either safe or not.  It seems they tend more to the safe side than not, at least that what it seems like.  The book has a lot of nice pretty pictures, and for those who are rushed for time and don't want to take an indepth look at a particular drug or treatment, then I suppose this book is adequate.  Although there are a lot of websites out there, imo, that have just as good information if not better.  I was suprised that Soy was given a green light given the nature that high amounts of soy does contain a chemical in it that might be considered by some to not be beneficial.  Definately a good book for some.  But for the serious alternative medicine researcher, there is no substitute for reading as much as you can from just about every source you can 
 The volume is fantastic in a number of ways: it's not a chronological compendium of photographs which is a plus in my opinion.  Photos are arranged by photographer, which gives well deserved credit to those who bring fabulous images to life. I also like the fact that each photograph is captioned with the name of the publication, month and year, and the model's name. It gives the ladies credit, and reminds us of the fleeting nature of their work. Linda and the rest of the ueber-models don't need a caption, we all know who they are, but so many of the other ones have come and gone :)  Be prepared to see about a 50/50 mix of color and BW photography. And enjoy photos from major European magazines, some of which select styles and types of photos that one may not find in the US. It's not just nudity, but a certain flair that is so european. In sum - get this wonderful book, it's well worth it. P.S. It weighs a ton, so don't lift the package too swiftly when it arrives at your door : 
 About a decade ago, I was having an early midlife crisis. I had been focusing heavilly on my career and work, and relationships had become somewhat peripheral, accessories, extracurricular.   What I didn't get was brought around to me by a flood of synchronicity that included a mad affair, Sufi poetry and several really good books. This was one of them. I think this is one of the best books available on learning to love The Beloved in self and others. Though we are born knowing how to love, we aren't born knowing how to have relationships.   I'd highly recommend this as a book to share with a young couple who is cohabitating or considering marriage, or for any young person who is mature enough to understand the differences between affection, infatuation, and love. 
 Jeanine Basinger's Silent Stars reconstructs the careers of the major silent film stars, packing in black and white screen shots with considerations of their films and times. A highly recommended, involving pick 
 I throughly enjoyed this book along with all of Frank's others in the series.  It seems to unravel all of those tangled up messes that the Institutional Church seems to weave.  All of his books set the captive free through his straight forward truth.  Although he is straight forward, he does not attack anyone per so.  He only attacks the system and justifiably so.  After reading, you will begin to see that the institutional church seems to be a "business" instead of what Jesus intended for it 
 I felt compelled to write this review because I thought it was important to respond to so many of the comments that criticize this book for its fictionality.  While it is certainly true that this book is far from "historically accurate," whatever that may mean, that in no way diminishes this book either as an important work or as a testimonial of Billie Holiday's life.  The artistic liberties that William Dufty takes help to place this work within a longer tradition of African American women's writing that stems in large part from nineteenth century slave narratives, and, as a result, this book is fascinating in its awareness of and interactions with these traditions.  It also remains devoted to a portraytal of Miss Holiday that exchanges accuracy for the sake not just of readability and commercial viability, but also for the sake of placing her story into and in opposition to a racist, sexist climate that ultimately destroyed one of the most important artists in American history.  A factual, chronological account of Miss Holiday's life would have crushed the importance of her story in ways that Dufty attempts to resist (with varying success) throughout this vitally important work of writing 
 An amazing collection of Raymond Pettibon's work spanning over the years.  High quality book loaded with images and information as well as interviews with Pettibon.  Up until now no other book offered as much insight on this relatively obscure artist. Buy it!! 
 the first letter is ambiguous. it could either be outopia or eutopia, thats greek. the o means no place, the e means good place, more left it squinting on purpose.   review wise its a must read but its not particularly enjoyable, of course i use robinsons translation (he was a contemporary so its in the english of the time, the kind you see in the king james bible).   the genius of the work is impossible to refute, but it is essentially just an intellectual game of more's, it belongs with philosophy before it belongs with lit, and as a result it carries all the tedium of philosophy. still, read it, ya might learn something. 
 This movie is a classic.  Although, I can barely stand to watch it.  It takes me on an emotional rollercoaster ride.  I bought it for my mother on Mother's Day.  Growing up, she and I would watch it everytime it came on television.  I wanted her to be able to see this tear-evoking memorable movie any time she pleases.  Great Mother's Day gift 
 I couldn't put this book down.  It is simply the most honest book I have read about a modern Indian community.  I am a white woman and I have been married into a Northwest Native fishing family for fifteen years.  Sullivan doesn't romanticize the Indian people in his story but he obviously respects them.  He sees their shortcomings but he does not judge them. Sullivan understands that no outsider can ever really know what treaty rights mean to Native Americans.  Yet Sullivan takes the reader  to the reservation and allows us to experience these tribal people as they live through a profound moment in their history.  Every detail in this book rang true, even the fact that Mr. Watson, an anti-whaling protest leader, would claim to be adopted by the Oglala.  I have run into many white people who believe that they know more about traditional Indian spirituality than actual Indians. The Makahs in this story don't fit anyones preconcieved ideas of how Indian people should act, feel, speak or pray.  This book is about a complex and ambiguous reality.  Without preaching, it shows how much we still can learn from Indian communities.  I bought a number of copies to give to my friends 
 Disclosure - I received my copy of this book as a gift from one of the contributors, who has been a personal friend of mine for years. As a woman on the spectrum, I am used to our views being constantly ignored.  The female experience of autism is qualitatively different from that of the male.  If we don't talk, we are "shy".  If we don't socialize with others, or need to watch what they are doing before we can attempt to join in, we're "not socially adept".  If we don't join in the backstabbing and constant talk about makeup, sexuality, and clothing starting in junior high and high school, we're downright weird.  It is both easier and harder to be a woman autistic.  People who think we are just shy frequently try to find ways to encourage us to "join in".  And a lot of behavior that people find threatening from males on the spectrum, while not precisely acceptable in us, is less socially inappropriate.  If one of us likes someone and doesn't know how to approach them, but constantly hangs around that person, someone might find a way to introduce us, if the person doesn't notice us by him or herself.  In a male autistic, this same behavior could lead to stalking charges and restraining orders.  The fact that so many different women contributed to this book is a big factor in its success - at least one voice in there is likely to speak to someone.  And as for being self-diagnosed and "trivializing" autism... it is very hard to get diagnosed as an adult.  Most of us, even those who have documentation of our severel language delay, are either "too successful" to be diagnosed (i.e., we have a relationship, employment, or advanced degrees and doctors dismiss our concerns about ourself), or are just diagnosed "Asperger's".  Personally, I spent much of my childhood echolalic and couldn't speak in sentences until I was almost 8.  I still flap, rock, and enjoy watching spinning objects, and am extremely auditorily hyper-sensitive.  I can still heard dog whistles.  Bright colors disturb me, and I still can't drink out of cups that are colors other than clear, white, or blue without throwing up. My childhood "diagnosis" was elective mutism (now called selective mutism) with autistic features, because I could read and answer yes/no or multiple choice questions.  At the time, to be called autistic, you had to be mentally retarded.  Learning disabilities (such as my inability to do even the simplest mathematical calculations) do not count.  As an adult, I am labelled Asperger's, even though I STILL meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for autism, since I have Semantic-Pragmatic Language Disorder, and the speech of people with Asperger's is supposed to be intact.  I work with children on the spectrum.  I love most of them very much, and hope that they can become at least as high-functioning as I am.  But I cannot understand their parents (other than a few who are actually on the spectrum or close to it [ADHD, etc]) to save my life.  I have a very succesful history of being able to connect to autistic children, including ones who "don't like strangers" who were climbing all over me within moments of being introduced, and even occasional words or eye contact from children who otherwise live in their own worlds.  People on the spectrum recognize each other, and these children seem to mostly realize that I am like them on some level.  At least one of the other women whose writing can be found on this book shares this kind of relationship with these children, and works in the caring professions.  Open your mind, and at least read what some of us think.  For people who are supposed incapable of thinking about ourselves or others, or of empathization, I find that most of us actually do better at these things than at least some neurotypicals (people who aren't on the spectrum) 
 The first third of this book is so unassuming, even (shudder) "quaint" and "old-fashioned," that I was jarred both by the sudden change in fortune for the storyteller and by the three drastic changes in point of view that cause one to question the very truthfulness of the narrator. There is a reason for this ploy: while certainly a novel about growing old, "The Seven Sisters" is, above all, about a woman who is struggling, late in life, to find her voice.  Candida Wilton is that woman, cast aside by her husband, who remarries after an affair, and even by her three daughters, who seem to side with their father. She moves from the pastoral neighborhoods of Suffolk to Ladbroke Grove, a squalid area of London, where she tries to make new friends, first by taking a class on Virgil at a dilapidated adult education school and then by joining the yuppified health club erected on the site after the school is shut down. She even manages to make the acquaintance of a few human specimens from the seedy "street theater" that both frightens and bemuses her during her strolls. And she spends much of her time recording thoughts on her journey through life onto her new laptop computer; it is the entries of this diary that comprise the book.  The novel's first shift occurs when Candida reaps the benefits of an unexpected inheritance and decides to gather a group of "sisters," both from her past and from her Virgil class, to accompany her on a tour retracing Aeneas's journey from Carthage to Naples. This voyage allows her to deliberate on the meaning of friendship, on her passive acceptance of whatever has life has thrown her way, and on the "irony ... that as we near death, there are fewer people left to be sorry, fewer left to miss us."  For many readers, Drabble's introspective musings will surely be dull and ponderous; the startling postmodern shifts will seem incongruous; and the melodramatic use of the inheritance might seem whimsical (most lonely women won't find self-esteem with the arrival of a windfall). But Drabble's prose is so unassuming and her character's mindset is so immediately familiar that I was fascinated, and there's just enough of a "plot" to keep this novel from becoming little more than a character study of a woman with not much character. Through the diary of Candida Wilton, Drabble conveys, as few authors can, the sensation of suddenly feeling old and alone. 
 Here we have a long playing CD capturing the great Moodies on a CD that if we were living in the age of the Long Player record would undoubtedly be broken down into 2 LP's...the first album showcasing their renown 1960's 1970's period and the last 8 tracks clearly at their post Seventh Sojourn album peak. While their great 1960's r&b single "Go Now" is included and is totally unlike the remaining disc, it is a bonus, in good sound (unlike the Magnificent Moodies cd) kicking things off historically on collecting tracks from their remaining catalogue. Indeed, the Moodies were an album bands(definitely their first 7 albums) and it is a disservice to juxtapose them on a best of package but such is the case here and since this is a collection of no new material it still sounds fresh collecting "hits" and is still a nice compilation with notes and photos within giving an overview of their good melodies and quality that is them.             
 Bought this book when we learned we were expecting because it was "the thing to do".  It contains good information, but after reading the first few chapters, it seems to offer little new information as you progress through the months.  I wish it had more detail on a week-to-week basis, but overall it is a good resource 
 Great story, winner of private eye writers Shamus award. 5 star. Lousy presentation - take off a star. The type in this edition of the book is just too, too small. Really denigrates the reading experience. Publisher, Bantam, was too concerned about the number of pages being printed it seems. Check out other editions before buying this one, you'll regret it if you don't. I know do 
 Jody hears a sound in the middle of the night, while sleeping over her friend Evelyn's house. It wakes them both up at once. It sounded like broken glass. Evelyn is scared.  Evelyn is always scared. She wants Jody to check it out with her.  Reluctantly Jody agrees.  They open the door together to take a peek, and a spear head punches through Evelyn's back.  It's tip scratches Jody's abdomen as Evelyn is lifted into the air. And thus starts "The Endless Night".    Detailed Rape- Graphic Gore- & Tons of Guns  If those 3 phrases are not something you want described in a horror novel, Then why are you reading Laymon? You might instead feel better reading some "feel-good" horror.    Because Laymon (in my opinion)is easily the greatest, and most graphic horror novelist this country has to offer. Simple prose, excellent pacing, (Seriously you'll read it in a day)  and enough nudity and gore to fill your Uncle Bob's swimming pool. Although (and it's a crying shame) he never made it big in his native U.S. (I personally blame it on America's puritanical upbringing.)  He was huge in Europe.  Anyway,  This novel doesn't take any time at all to start up. It's comes out of the gate with a rocket up it's ...... posterior. And it never let's go of your throat from there on in. The chapters following the main protagonist (Jody) are kind of slow, but they have their moments and small pay-offs. However the chapters chronicaling the adventures of Simon (the main antagonist) are priceless.  During these chapters, (which are spoken into a tape recorder), Simon not only kills and rapes his way to Jody, but also tells of the exploits of "The Killer Krulls" (The merry band of murderers he belongs to, that break into peoples homes to rape and mutilate them.)  I coudn't possibly go into all the gory details (we're talking alot of violence here; anything from group rape to child murder), but what I can say is, this book was vicious, even for Laymon. (There was one comical scene though, worth mentioning: involving a younger "Killer Krulls" playing catch with their first victims disembodied heart. All the while one them is whistling the theme from the "Harlem Globe-Trotters".)  Only buy this book (or any of his, for that matter) if your'e looking for a bloody, vicious read. Because, in all honesty, you won't be sleeping with both eyes shut for a good, long time.    MORAL OF THE STORY: The World is Full of Psychos. Buy a Gun!!!                  
 I thought this CD was great. He talks about food a lot but it's still funny. Frankly, i thought....BETTER than the last Dane Cook cd i bought. It's only an hour though, i wish it was longer. 
 The morning I stumbled on this movie, I was intrigued by the title. I actually watched the whole movie and then watched again. I have read with the reviews before posting my own.   The morning after i watched it, I got my partner and she and I watched it. True, it did not provide the blood and guts, but it was not intended too.  This movie would be appreciated by bands that are just starting out to make it big.  Yes it was surprising that it was made in Africa.  But the best scenes in the movie were near the end.  The surprise in the band was cool and most definate, the selling of the land.  We thought it was a great movie and away from the Friday the 13th predicative scenes.  Awesome movie.  Yes, we would buy the movie.  The music in the beginning could fit the title and be a little more heavy, but thats cool!!  
 This has become one of my favorite Grisham books (it ranks up there with The Firm and The Client).  I love the topic being the cigarette industry and coming from Richmond, VA (home of Philip Morris which seems to be like the company mentioned in the book), it was that much more intriguing.  Thrown in there are the usual Grisham-like bad guys.  The hero, though, is not a lawyer, but a jury member, Nicholas Easter, with a knack for persuasion.  With his girlfriend, Marlee, they are working to singlehandledly take down the cigarette industry.  Sound impossible?  Maybe, but considering all the legal issues that the cigarette industry has had over the years, it seems believable that there could be one case that would decide the precedent for future lawsuits.  The bad guy, Rankin Fitch, is perfectly evil and will do what he can to make sure that the tobacco industry is protected.  Some highlights in this book include humor, likable minor characters, and fast-paced suspense that makes you want to keep reading and reading.  While I did not see the movie and heard that it is not about the cigarette industry (but gun manufacturers instead - typical HOLLYWOOD!), I recommend that you read the book instead.  You will not be disappointed 
 This book is for professionnals who are always in a hurry to take care of computers. You've got the essentials and no more. But you find easely what you're searching. And it's more valuable than more accurate informations 
 Captain Shane Schofield, UMSC, call-sign "Scarecrow", returns in Matthew Reilley's second installation of another mayhem-filled Scarecrow-experience. Having been promoted to "captain" Schofield is now a keeper of the President of the United States of America. However, as a routine secret facility visit goes bust, with the President smack dab in the middle, it is up to Schofield and his merry Marine crew to save the President, and America for that matter.  To put this simply, do not ever read this book if you can't accept a work of fiction, no matter how amazingly unbelievable and fantastic it may be, as purely FICTION. Hats off to Reilly for once again allowing me to be free with my imagination with the help of his work. This book, having read prior to ICE STATION, is the only book in which I remember gasping and saying "Oh my gawd!" outloud.   The action grabs you and, unlike other books I've read, the illustrations and maps help you understand exactly what's happening.  Unbelievable? Yes. But this IS a work of fiction that involves fantastic elements to put you in a *whoa* mood. I've yet to pick up a book that would do to me what Reilly has.  Why not a 5-star rating? Well, in all honesty, Reilly's attempt at the romance between Scarecrow and Fox fizzles and dies before it even begins. It's possible for him to be in a relationship, but the chemistry between him and Fox isn't even "warm". It seems that Reilly "struggles" to develop this romantic relationship although he started it off well with Ice Station. Reilly should take baby steps when dealing with relationships in his "Scarecrow" novels 
 This book must be every hospitals library I am a hospital sub manage 
 We've had this exact Peugeot 7" Pepper Grinder for 28 years.   We bought it because my Mother In-Law had been using hers for about 30 years (which was 28 years ago, and shes 84 and still  uses it).  This Pepper Grinder is used daily, works excellent,  never failed.  I'm buying one for my daughter for Christmas  and I know she'll have it long after I'm gone 
 If the 7th edition is too expensive for you, this is the one you should choose 
 When I got this I was a little worried it would be too cheapy b/c the materials are light-weight.  But, I set to putting it together and the directions were VERY easy and all the pieces were there and when I got done I was estatic.  It was just so easy and looked so good! I have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer. Unlike other reviewers, I find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all.  Maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts 
 Booker Little, Eric Dolphy, and Mal Waldron all sound fantastic on this album. The compositions are somewhat minimal, and like someone else has said, they really showcase the soloist. The playing, for the most part, is top notch and a pleasure to listen to. However, an earlier reviewer described Ron Carter on cello as a "revelation". I really have to disagree completely. I find his playing to be the one major downfall of this album. On the opening track his entrance sounds promising enough as he interacts with the bass to form just an awesome line, but other strong moments with Ron seem to be few and far between. His soloing sounds uninspired and no where near the level set by the group around him. His technique sounds very limited and his intonation is far from right on. Maybe I am missing something, but every time I listen to The Quest I find myself wishing he wasn't there. I feel bad talking about Ron Carter this way because I am generally a fan of his bass playing, but oh well. In the end I think this is a great album and certainly worth hearing but is somewhat set back by the addition of Ron Carter on cello. Also maybe I am wrong, but is that Ed Blackwell on drums? It sounds like him to me, but I know he wasn't listed in the liner notes. Maybe it had something to do with record labels... I don't know.  
 Blows very warm air far out into the room (much better than the other 7 or 8 portable heaters I've used that only heat the floor for 2 feet). Controls are easy to use. Unfortunately mine arrived with a loose fan inside. I found one of the screws holding the fan was cross-threaded and broken, and the other one was loose (this was poor assembly, not shipping damage). I fixed it, rather than returning it, and it works well (I don't recommend anyone doing this unless you have electrical expertise - and a long Safety Torx driver for the screws) 
 The greatest fantasy role playing setting ever published gets a good dusting off with this re-release.  Stays true to the original, yet adds 'flesh' to many of the items (towns, villages) which were merely mentioned in the original.  Still, like the original, the key to this set is that the individual GM can (and should) add further custom detail to these settings and events to easily come up with unique and fantastic adventures.  If you've never gamed with anything but canned, 'read-the-boxed-text' settings and adventures where everything is dictated down to the NPC conversations, you really owe it to yourself to buy this, study it, and treat your gang to a new way of gaming.  This is what D&D was originally intended to be.  Biased?  Yes.  I was as contributor (I do not receive compensation, so increased sales do not benefit me).  But there were many, many contributors, chief of which is the original material and new bits added by Bob Bledsaw, founder of The Judges Guild.  This set stacks up against any fantasy campaign ever published.  Do yourself a favor and buy it now before you're spending 5 times as much to get it on eBay in 5 years 
 This is one of my favorite books and I've recommended it to many of my friends. All of them have loved it. If you like horses, Montana, the west, or just plain good writing this book is well worth the investment. If you  have never been out west read this book before you come because Spike will  give you a good idea of what it's like to live out here 
 If you are looking for a book on the ancient Israelites origins you will not find a better book then this one.   It discusses most of the current theories and discusses them in some detail. So you will get a fairly good background on current thinking on the subject as well. Unfortunately some of his comments do get a bit ugly but those of us who have read Dever have got used to this trait 
 I just wanted to commend the "Reader from Port Townsend, Washington," for writing one of the best customer reviews I've read in all my time surfing the Amazon web.  I didn't finish the book, but am  giving it 5 stars out of respect for my Port Townsend comrade 
 Powerful, fast moving, comprehensive, well researched, resourceful, well filmed, comfortable to the eye, I could go on and on describing this brilliant work by PBS. This feature is like a tour to various artists' studios and exhibitions without leaving your chair. I loved it so much I ordered the 1st & 2nd seasons, which come together by the way on one DVD.  They should add this tagline to the DVD box: "Inspiration GUARANTEED!" What are you waiting for? Click 'Add to Shopping Cart' right now 
 When I am in need of the clarifing on some things I go here and this book explains it well 
 Innes-Smith is back again with another hilarious book.  When you were a kid waiting at the salon/barber to get your hair cut, do you remember picking up those large books filled with the latest hairstyles?  I remember thinking they were hideous back then.  Well, they really were hideous/hilarious and the author has collected them for this pictorial of bad coifs.  Great book to leave on your coffee table to amuse your guests 
 An excellent overall book on Halloween & ways to celebrate it. The party tips are well-themed & not cliched -- they're also geared towards adults, not kids. There's some unique decoration ideas here that will help make your party shine. The only problem is there are only a few photos in this book, & they're black & white so you can't see much detail. But the party suggestions are first-rate, & not the same old stuff as in other books 
 This is a handy little book if you need a quick source of basic cultural information about a particular orchid. The book contains 250 color photos over 160 types of orchid species and hybrids. This makes it a valuable aid in identifying those mystery orchids that we all seem to come across 
 This book will change the way you view the entire medical industry as it relates to drugs.  This book is not for the casual reader who just wants an overview of what's going on.  It is an in depth, thoroughly researched, literary work that exposes how the drug industry runs the show.  Mr Abramson backs up what he claims with citings ad nauseum of study upon study.  He has made it his passion to study and analyze studies and present his findings in a way that the lay person can easily grasp.  This book gave me incredibly useful information regarding the drug world out there.  I don't even take drugs other than some aspirin, and yet I found this book to be utterly fascinating, revealing, even riveting at times.  If you want to learn more about how the public and possibly you are being lied to, duped, having the facts twisted every which way but loose, even being physically threatened then you must read this book 
 As a graduate of Jack Radcliffe's photography program and now one of his models, I have to say that Jack is one of the most remarkable people that I know. He is the most caring person this world possibly has and he shows this in his hospice work. He is truely so proud of this acomplishment and he should. I recently experianced hospice life with a relative and it was heart breaking. But these photographers show the heros of the hospice that give these folks a sense of peace and comfort in a time where they know things will not improve. I highly recommend this book. You wont be sorry 
 My 15 month old son adores this book. This is the first book I've been able to get him to sit still for - he loves interacting with the tabs and watching the result.  If you're looking for a fun, informative book that really grabs young readers - this is it!   We have a great time with Maisy  as she prepares for bed every night 
 The actors,the music, the scenery just everything about this picture is outstanding. Mitchum is in his prime. The cast was well chosen. This is a true classic. Wouk made sure the producers did not short change his book and they did not. 
 One day, the author, Lisa Shulman (author and a former classroom teacher), was making soup while her daughters read the Gingerbrad Man story.  OY! BING! Inspiration.  The Matzo Ball Boy was born.  With lovely deep reds and oranges, chicken soup yellows, and forest greens, we read the story of a childless bube, who is preparing for a lonely Passover meal.  A shanda.  When, oy, her matzo ball comes alive.  A Matzo Boy Boy is born. Boy, Shmoy he tells her.  He is a man, and off to make his way in the world and not in a soup bowl.  He runs and she gives chase.  As do the tailor, the rabbi, the yenta, and a wolf that is not as smart as he thought.  In the forest, the matzo ball boy gets tired and hungry; he meets up with a poor man who isn't interested in giving chase.  Let all who are hungry come and eat, so the boy comes to the poor man's cottage.  When the matzo ball boy leans over to check out the poor family's soup...    This humorous tale is a must have for your seder table or bookcase.  Includes not a "glass tea" but something better, a glossary of 14 Jewish word 
 great and beautiful songs.  It's a lovely soundtrack to a grand musical.  Marni Nixon has such a beautiful and clear voice, so lovely and feminine.  Yul Brynner has a wonderful masuline voice, very beautiful.  All the tracks sound really good.  It has some of the most beautiful and remembered songs on it, like, "Hello Young Lovers," and "Shall we Dance.&quot 
 It's hard to describe the fulfillment one feels after reading anyone of the books in Burrough's series. The complete dominance of honor, and the constant heroism and adventure in these books is heart warming, as well as  thrilling. In this part of the series, somewhat to my dissappointment, John  Carter is no longer telling the story, but his son, Carthoris, is. Readers  of the first three books don't be alarmed however! Carthoris is "just  as good a story teller as his father." And the story is just as  exciting 
 This book takes you through all the firsts in Roxanne's life, starting with pie and ending with her first child. Each chapter gives you a tiny slice of her world without ever telling you how she dealt with it. It is perfectly structured and equally frustrating because the author makes you care and then only doles out little pieces of what you want to know.  The author tried to cover a lot of subjects without every getting in-depth with any of them. It glances over racism, homosexuality, the death of her father, incest, drug addictions, and PTSD. The gaps between these two minute subjects are filled with Roxanne and her family indulging in baked goods because "No one is on a diet in Annette TX" And ending with recipes for whatever they ate in that chapter.   This book has enough light, feel good, fun moments to counter the drama sprinkled though it to make it totally readable no matter what kind of mood you are in. 
 The audio was fast moving had some twists and turns kept you guess who the murderer was.  Enjoyed the book tape tremendousl 
 it was wonderful to return to Cage's hometown and spend days in suspense. There have only been a couple books written by Greg Iles that didn't hold my interest. This certainly wasn't one of them. Like in most books there was a period about 2/3 of the way through that he could have moved on a little faster, but the story was interesting, sad, perhaps almost too true and brought so many aspects of life in a small southern town. The ending certainly did throw me, I wonder how many others will be surprised. I hope he does more books using a similar setting. 
 This book reminds us that evangelizing is what is supposed to be at the heart of biblical counseling. Although the bible clearly teaches that we should bear one another's burdens, to often it is assumed that the person seeking counseling has a clear understanding of the gospel of Christ. With this assumption, the goal of the counselor is to give hope, encouragement and the tools necessary to ease the temporal burdens while overlooking the greater goal of the eternal that is to be the first and foremost concern of a biblical counselor. To rob a person of the eternal at the expense of the temporal is a potential mistake that all Evangelicals need to be on their guard to not make through their compassion to bear one another's burdens.    With the obvious false teaching infiltrating the church today, it makes perfectly good sense to question the beliefs of the person seeking counseling. Is also makes perfectly good sense that a counselor needs to have a good solid knowledge of Christian apologetics that is consistent with sound doctrine. The example of the woman who was an Oneness Pentecostal was a perfect example of the importance of taking the approach to counseling as the authors have clearly pointed out. This book is to be applauded for the bold stance that has been taken in adhering to sound doctrine.   The book is aptly sub-titled "Equipping Christians for an Evangelical counseling ministry" and although I may not agree with every aspect of the author's beliefs, the disagreements are negligible.  I give this book a four star rating and recommend this book for any serious biblical student to add to their studies who may have a desire to bear one another's burdens as a biblical counselor.   Ann Koch A serious bible student. 
 Sure, Tolstoy is a very good writer but it's a stretch to try and claim that AK is the "best novel ever written." I found it unfocused and slow in developing a plot. O.k., part of that is just the style of the writing of the time but that's not a complete excuse.   Personally, I think Dostoyevsky is a better and more interesting writer. Tolstoy is a classic, and I respect him for that, but don't assume he's great just because people (including Oprah) tell you so.. 
 I think "Pork Soda" is completely enjoyable for its heavy bass grooves, humor, and outright quirkiness.  If you can't tolerate strange, though, don't get this.  "My Name Is Mud", "Welcome to This World", "Bob", and "Nature Boy" get my pick.  Those instrumental tracks "Wounded Knee" and "Pork Chop's Little Ditty" are good, as well.  Overall, some entertaining jams here 
 Ishikawa makes a careful and intense analysis about the meaning of the Quality Control . Its reading is ver interesting and passionate . It is a fundamental tool for all those managements who really want improve their productivity in their respective work places . A must for you to have it  
 Anzia Yezierska's "Bread Givers" is, in a sense, two overlapping stories. The first half of the book is the melodramatic tale of an impoverished Jewish immigrant family living in the New York ghetto, a family suffering under the tyrannical and hypocritical piousness of the father. At times the foolishness and ineptitude of the father is almost comic, but the suffering inflicted on his family is harrowingly poignant. The second half is a psychologically and sociologically astute feminist coming-of-age tale, as the youngest daughter breaks from her family to re-define herself as an "Americanerin," leaving for college and eventually becoming a teacher in her old neighborhood. The broader strokes of the novel's opening give way to provocative considerations of the difficulties inherent in the narrator's at times ambivalent desires for assimilation within an alien culture and for a self-respecting independence from her own patriarchal family 
 Delightful, funny, sad story that captured me right from the start.  I couldn't put it down 
 This edition should be a must read for all.  This edited version seems to contain all the salient thoughts of de Tocqueville for those of us who don't want to get bogged down in a tome. I will not repeat who he was or the subjects covered -- suffice to say if you want to understand some of todays America -   what it stands for and how it is goverened this seems to be a great primer on its government and peoples. The amazing thing to me is how much is still true and how amazingly insightfuld Tocqueville was. He is still widely quoted even today. 
 It had been three years since the release of Jets first album ,"Get Born" so I was very excited for the release of "Shine On" This album is simply amazing. I dont know what other word to use. Almost ever song is great. Some of my favorites include....  Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is  Hey Kids  Stand Up   Shine On  Skin and Bones 
 If you have been reading this series this is a great read. But do not start with this one, nor try to read this one with out reading "Falcon..." first!   I've just started reading the Amelia stories this summer, and have read them in order--if I did not know this was not the last book, it easily could have been. It wrapped up a lot of the loose ends that had been hanging for quite some time.  This book is my favorite so far, I cannot imagine any I will like quite as well.    I've been reading some of the other reviews and have noticed many who are "tired" of both Amelia's and Emerson's overbearing ways and of their always being right.  Read your history, they are the Personification of British gentry of that era.  Read the books  a bit closer and you'll see how Ms. Peters has written it with a great deal of humor, they really are quite funny. After reading these books all summer, I find Amelia quite refreshing, and a pretty good roll model for women today, she sure knows how to handle her husband, and she definitely did not need Nanny 911 
 I am absolutely amazed with the progress I have made this semester in my Stage Voice class which utilizes the Linklater method. When I began her method two months ago, I had problems with articulation, projection, and  breathing. In addition to that, my muscles in my throat had atrophied to  the point that I was a AltoII in vocal range. However, with persistent work  with her method, my vocal range is between SopranoII and AltoII, and I can  project and articulate my words with no problem. Indeed, I am currently in  a mainstage production at my school that demands I use a West Indies  accent. Because I have learned to "free the voice" my  performances have literally knocked my audience dead. People just can't  believe the change! Run, don't walk to buy this book 
 The tawdry glamour of Temple Hill, Bradfield is the setting for Val McDermid's latest thriller The Torment of Others. Home of prostitutes, rent boys, homeless people, and drug dealers; redbrick and seedy, Temple Fields harbors shop fronts with little allure, small entrepreneurial businesses with rundown, dilapidated bed sits above. It's a foggy, disparate inner-city suburb, and an easy place for a serial killer to hide and strike without warning.    Someone, haunted by "the Voice" has begun to prowl the streets of Temple Fields at night. The Voice is inside his head, telling him it's time to move again, time for the next chapter of the lesson, and time for another cleansing. He doesn't think of the prostitutes as individuals with a name; he'll just think of them as rubbish that has to be got rid of before it poisons the world he has to live in.   In The Torment of Others, the scruffy profiler Dr. Tony Hill and the hardheaded, intuitive detective Carol Jordan are back in the city of Bradfield, working together again to find this killer who is tying up prostitutes and killing them slowly while a video camera records in the background. The women are being murdered in a manner identical to a previous investigation three years ago, but the killer, Derek Tyler confessed to the murders and has been incarcerated in the Bradfield Moor Secure Hospital, where Tony now works.   Carol, in her battle for restoration, is pushed by her boss John Brandon to mount an undercover operation using DC Paula McIntyre, who resembles the victims. Not only does this bring back awful memories for Carol, who was raped in an undercover operation, but also because the operation itself ends up going goes awry. Tony is perplexed that the killer knows so much about the police's maneuverings. Could it be an inside job? Could the killer have perhaps had help from someone on the Force?   Tony is convinced that Derek Tyler knows something about the modus operandi of the murders and attempts to break the killer's three-year silence through some sharp psychological interrogation. He even tells Carol that there could be two killers, who are being manipulated to be instruments of someone else's murderess fantasies. A voyeur turned puppet-master who is getting off on the assertion of absolute power and is controlling and masterminding the whole production. This "someone" uses bondage because it increases the foolproof quality of the attack and his victims are submissive from the start.   Like the handcuffs that are used to grip the young girls to the bed, this deftly plotted and totally suspenseful novel holds you tight and never lets you go. Like no other author, McDermid excels in presenting the darker side of human nature, the world of psych-sexual deviancy that can lurk just beneath the surface of everyday lives.   For the first time Tony and Carol find themselves stumped in their efforts to map the mind of the murderer. For some reason the killers mind feels "as slippery as saturated autumn leaves that would fall apart in his hands before Tony could examine them." And although Tony knows that finding the killer involves first finding the thread, the problem is untangling the web of external symbols and translating their meanings.  Atmospheric and riveting, this terrific book jumps out at you and never loses pace. The obvious is turned inside out as the plot twists in a serpentine path to a nail-biting ending. The characters are completely realistic, especially the emotionally fraught Carol as she tries to resist the easy comfort of alcohol - nervous of its easy promise of oblivion. She keeps telling herself that she doesn't want to sleepwalk through the aftermath of rape. "She wants to deal with it, to unpick its effects and put herself back together in something approximating the right order."  McDermid is a master of cunning and innovative plot twists; and the author well knows the intricacies of police procedural and the criminal mind, the easy deception inherent in human nature. She writes from the heart, with what she knows so well - the uneasy psychology of the serial killer.  In Temple Fields, the streets form a web around the spider's prey; life goes on in patterns too deep-set to be altered by the heavy weight of the police presence. And the killer continues to swagger on, wrapped in a sense of contemptuous invulnerability. No one is as they seem in this highly enthralling and gripping novel with a nail biting ending that is full of surprises as it is action-packed. Mike Leonard July 05.  
 Brighton Beach Memoirs is the beginning of Neil Simon's Eugene Jerome trilogy based on his youth.    Eugene Jerome (Jonathan Silverman in his film debut) is fifteen. He is hitting the puberty and can't control thinking of it.  His goal in life is to be the first Jewish pitcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers.   But his mother (Blythe Danner) has other ideas for his future.  His mother runs the house with an iron fist and guilt.  His father (Bob Dishy) is working two jobs just to make ends meet.  His older bother  Stanley, has just lost his job for talking back to his boss.   Also living with the Jerome's is Blanche's invalid sister (Judith Ivey) and her two daughters.  The older one Eugene has more than a passing crush on.  The main theme of this film is too many people living in too little room with too little money.  In the end all conflicts arise from this.  This is Neil Simon at his most personal.  The only problem is bad casting in the lead.  Jonathan Silverman never captures Eugene's spirit.  He just seems to be saying the lines and doesn't seem to understand what he is saying.  Matthew Broderick created the role in Los Angeles and then Broadway and won a Tony Award.  Silverman just doesn't have the comic timing to pull this difficult role off.  On the other side, Blythe Danner shines as Eugene's mother Blanche.  Without having to tell the audience her problems, she makes them clear with her delivery.  Judith Ivey, in an early role, shows the frailty of Blanche's sister.  This is a very good film and is good background for the excellent second installment Biloxi Blues.  Unfortunately, as of today, the final part, Broadway Bound has not been released on DVD.  DVD EXTRAS: None 
 This book is a beautiful book about German photographer Germain Krull.  Her career spanned the 20th century and several continents.  Her work during the 1920s in Paris helped shape the modern photographic style, and  Kim Sichel's writing about this photographer is clear and insightful.  I  would recommend this book to anyone interested in influential women or in  photography 
 One of the most creatively told stories I've ever read.   Groundbreaking, inspiring, and extremely intelligent. When it was recommended to me, I was told that it "will change my life". This book will definitely leave a mark 
 Dr Feingold's theory is that bad behaviour and/or learning disabilities in otherwise bright children is caused by artifical colors and flavors. Although it may seem too simplistic, it is the answer IF you, as a parent, are willing to alter your lifestyle by reading ingredient labels and preparing food that is normal, natural and healthy. A child cannot do this on their own! But you will save your child's future and maybe your own sanity. A must buy 
 NEVER CRY WOLF is Farley Mowat's first-person reminiscence of his time spent studying wolves in the Canadian arctic. NEVER CRY WOLF, first published in 1963, was one of the earliest, most widely-read, and most effective conservation narratives ever penned. It's Russian edition (the title of which, literally translated back into English, is WOLVES, PLEASE DON'T CRY) was responsible for a Soviet ban on wolf hunting that spared the animals in their natural habitat and gained Mr. Mowat a notorious reputation at the U.S. State Department, which banned his subsequent entry into the United States.    NEVER CRY WOLF has been attacked as being more fable than fact, and this may be true. Mowat has often said that he prefers not to let facts get in the way of the truth, and there is no question that he wanted his readers to come to love these generally benighted creatures. If one doubts the low esteem in which wolves are held one only needs to consider representative northern European fairy tales: Peter and the Wolf, Little Red Riding Hood, and others present the wolf as a four-legged homicidal maniac. Unfortunately, this agelong prejudice has nearly exterminated the wolf in most of its range, courtesy of a certain two-legged homicidal maniac. Like our primordial fear of the dark, and the very common terror of cats, lukophobia derives from the lost years of the cave.  Mowat tells a good story. As a young Game Warden he is sent to remote northermost Canada to evaluate the effect of wolf depredations on the caribou herds. What he finds is that the wolves eat only sick, aged, or weak caribou, thus contributing to natural selection (while human beings are actively destroying whole herds of caribou). He finds that the usual wolf diet is skinks, voles and mice (he claims to have tried mouse as a meal and includes a recipe for Souris a la Creme in the book). He finds that the wolves are a natural part of the ecosystem, and that a pack of wolves together is far less destructive than even a single human being with a rifle.  Mowat tells us of observing a wolf family at close range, the members of which he names "George", "Angeline," and "Uncle Albert." Together with a litter of pups, these three become the center of Mowat's tale. He credits them with all sorts of anthropomorphisms including dramatic abilities to communicate amongst themselves and with other wolves, and gives each a strikingly distinct personality. He respects George and he likes the clownish Uncle Albert, but he is simply head-over-heels in love with Angeline, over whom he waxes almost as rhapsodic as if she were a human female.   Lupinologists dismiss most of Mowat's observations as purely imaginative. Whether Mowat tosses away his credibility or makes his point more powerfully by ascribing so many fine human virtues to these creatures (they are nothing short of poster-wolves for 'family values') is dependent upon the reader and his or her mindset toward the natural world.   For this reviewer, who is tired of the slow, careless and sometimes intentional destruction of our natural environment, and who is convinced that our Earth is striking back against the imbalances we've created by generating warming seas, melting icecaps, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, and all sorts of other phenomena, it does not seem at all a bad idea for us to humanize the wolf if by so humanizing him we will be more inclined to save him. And the same goes for the rest of the planet.        
 I like the size. The speed on reading and writing is usually just fine, but when writing a group of small files it takes ages 
 I read an earlier edition of this book shortly after graduating from journalism school in 1983.  I wanted to make money with my photographs and Rohn Engh's book answered every question I could imagine.  I followed his advice and for years was a successful stock photographer.   I was also a stay-at-home mom homeschooling three kids, so I only worked a few hours a week, yet still managed to plump the family income.   Now I'm a portrait photographer and still do a little stock on the side.  I advise anyone who is interested in selling their photos to read this book and save a lot of time in the process 
 Ramana's path is clear as are the images of this sage.Try his simple teaching & in time you might start feeling very grateful for having come across this book 
 IF YOU HAVE MORE AMBITION: TRY THE KING OF ALL MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!  Problems in Mathematical Analysis (Hardcover)  by g. yankovsky (Translator), B. Demidovich (Author Publisher: mir publisher; 4th Printing edition (1976)  ASIN: B000GTC2GA 
 The production on this album bothered me for the longest time but this is truly a timeless classic. I don't know how many people realize that Sublime were the real deal. Up until their self-titled album, they were always under produced and best represented live. This music has so much heart though, it is unbelievable. There are more self-proclaimed singles on this CD than there are on the bands self-titled effort. A lot of these songs never saw the "light" we call radio, but songs like 40oz. To Freedom, Smoke To Joints, We're Only Gonna Die For Our Arrogance, Don't Push, 5446, Badfish, and basically the rest of the CD, are all great tunes. Artists like Bob Marley are receiving a lot of attention lately, and it seems to be a trend. Sublime is getting a lot of attention too, and it's okay. Sublime was a band that pioneered a sound. And, during the 90s, they were an out to all the grunge that dominated the era. This is also the only album I hear so many people complaining that they have worn out. Like that's a bad thing 
 I use my half-pint as a purse during the day when I'm at school or out with my son. It has a key holder in the front pocket and just enough room for my wallet, mt daily planner, a water bottle and whatever else I need to carry with me. Plus, you can throw it in the washing machine and dryer when it gets dirty.  I get tons of compliments on this little bag. 
 The cost was great with lots of detail. Our 8-year old grandson loved it and has worn it to play in besides for Halloween 
 Big Daddy Kane is easily one of the top 3 lyricists of all-time. There is no disputing how good his lyrics were, but what separates him from all others (except his equal - Rakim) was his Flow. He took his lyrics and made them into an audio work of art. Listen to him string words together in Hip Hop's all-time number 1 bragging track (Ain't No Half-Steppin') and you are mesmerized by his delivery, then you skip back to the start, hit play and start trying to keep up with Hip Hop's smoothest MC.   This album contained more than just the best bragging track of all-time, it contained another hip hop classic that anyone who calls themself a hip-hop Head must know to be considered a member: RAW. BDK strings lyrics and his flow together with his killer voice over a cathy James Brown drum sample and you have old school magic.   I hate to echo the words of every other reviewer but when they are speaking the truth I don't mind: THIS IS A CLASSIC CD, PERIOD. If you love hip-hop or if you're new to Hip Hop, this is where your collection should start. As other's have said, there is only one filler track, and the rest all rate around 4 stars apiece. Do yourself a favour and avoid the garbage that hip hop is currently putting out and go back to the old school, where the lyrics were as good as the beats, and their was substance over flash 
 Having chewed and digested "Around the World in Eighty Days", "Five Weeks in a Balloon" and "Journey to the Centre of the Earth", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked "true" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, "20,000 Leagues" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.  Professor Arronax leaves a "normal" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the "modern" or "known" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.  Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.   The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.  However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in...  ...The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?  A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic 
 I've always used this technique. But I always felt bad about it. I've absorbed the cultural messages that as a woman, I should come when a man is doing what makes him come.  It's so ridiculous! That's what makes him come! In fact, I think men should start feeling bad about themselves that they "almost" come when I do this. ;) (Kidding!)   It's such a relief to see the technique described and discussed as acceptable and welcomed by so many people. Thanks. Thank goodness I can quit worrying about it. For the few men (& women) that denigrate it, I guess I'll just skip you as a sexual partner. ;) (Kidding again!)  Thanks to the author, publisher, sellers and reviewers. 
 An extemely imaginative book.  Very well written.  Very interesting to people who enjoy reading about evolutionary forms other than primates. Very interesting speculations.  My only criticism is that the closer we get to modern humans the more sterotyped the individuals become.  I began to correctly predict the outcome of various encounters.  The consequenses of the modern time disaster were predictable, but not believeable 
 Amazingly all-encompassing, this book is a must. Ms. Shomon offers honest information in a manner that neither talks down nor oversimplifies. Magnificent 
 This book completely changed my understanding and level of jazz piano playing.  It is short and to the point, yet carefully written and complete.    I like the fact that the author is a trained engineer.  As a computer  programmer I can identify with the way the book is layed out very logically  with the assumption that the reader is intelligent, interested,  and  motivated.  I read the entire book while on trains going to and from work.   I think it would have been a distraction to have read it while at a piano.       The chord pattern excercises at the end of the book are excellent; I am  methododically going through all of them using a PC based sequencer  connected via midi to an electronic keyboard.    If you only buy one book  on jazz piano, I think it should be this one.       The next book to read  after this one, in my opinion is "All about Chords".  I am almost  finished reading it;  I could never have handled it if I hadn't read  "Modern Jazz Piano" first. The two books together are  magnificently complete.     I have a quite a library of jazz piano and jazz  books; most of them are padded and not of much use.  "Modern Jazz  Piano" is by contrast a classic that every jazz pianist should have.        I lost many years because I was brain-washed into believing the John  Mehegan jazz system as taught at Julliard was the only way to learn jazz. I  now believe the Julliard system is hopelessly complicated and not  effective.  The traditional harmony systems used in "Modern Jazz  Piano" are the best and also the most popular.  It is not something  esoteric that only propeller heads know about.   Buy it and hold onto it.   Even if it sits on your bookshelf for years, there will come a day when it  will speak eloquently to you and change your level of playing and  understanding 
 I just finished reading '2012, The return of Quetzalcoatl' by Daniel Pinchbeck. The book came very highly recommended by a well respected associate, and the endorsement by Sting on the back cover sure didn't hurt either. I happen to read very slowly, entering the inner world of a book fully, and few books really grab my interest enough to get me beyond the first few chapters, but this book had me resenting the fact that I had to sleep and go to work, because all I wanted to do was keep reading.  The day I purchased the book, Al Gore was on the Charlie Rose show discussing the film 'An Inconvenient Truth', about the precarious predicament we've gotten ourselves into environmentally. Al smiled sagely at one point and calmly indicated to Charlie Rose that the needed leaps in consciousness, that are vital to the survival of the planet and life as we know it, will not come in a normal linear fashion, we don't have time for that, there has to be, and will be, a rapid shift in planetary consciousness.   Later that day, I opened up '2012, The Return of Quetzalcoatl' and started to read. It was like diving into a continuation of the same theme, and I was struck by the synchronicity. I flipped to the author's picture and recognized him right off, we'd been to some of the same parties in New York City, and I remembered his articles from Wired magazine and The New York Times Magazine. I searched on the internet for his most current project, Evolver magazine, and was greeted by an Atlantean image on the magazine's cover that was almost exactly like one I had designed more than a decade previously; yet more synchronicity.  In this book, Daniel Pinchbeck has attempted the monumental task of getting his mind around the whole history of consciousness on Earth and beyond. He explores awesome mysteries, touching on every spiritual tradition, every enlightened piece of the puzzle and its opposite. In the Author's own words, "Often I have felt less like a person than a convenient intersection for ideas to meet and mesh, a magnet or strange attractor, compelled or fated---perhaps tragically misguided---to draw together Jungian psychology, quantum paradox, Frankfurt School critique, anthroposophy, and Mayan mythology with explorations of such seemingly outrï¿½ subjects as crop circles, alien abductions, Amazonian shamanism, and the end of time."  At first, his writing was so rich with description and image that I found myself having to read paragraphs several times over, but as I got into his flow of consciousness, I began to revel in the way he wildly strung adjectives together to put a visceral feeling across to his reader, reminiscent at times of my favorite Virginia Wolfe. Daniel's depictions of his personal quest represent a gold standard for relaying this kind of information. He has succeeded in significantly extending our occult vocabulary, where occult refers to 'hidden', pushing the envelope of possibilities to the limit. What Carlos Castaneda began, Daniel matures and extends to the far reaches of what can be conceived of at this time, a Mozart of words, or better yet, Bach because Bach's music brings us into a whole other world, opening up the dimensions wide.   Quoting all the greatest thinkers of our time, embellishing and building upon their theories and observations, Daniel Pinchbeck leads his reader deeper and deeper into a labyrinth, weaving theme upon theory, each subsequent insight building on the previous, pushing out the envelope to the max, until, like a hypnotic Bach fugue, one suddenly finds oneself in a breakthrough, as if we've climbed to a higher perspective and can see the whole maze in its entirely and it all makes perfect sense.  And underneath it all is the author's "dazzling kaleidoscopic journey through the quixotic hinterlands of consciousness, crop circles, and ancient prophecy, as well as an intriguing and deeply personal odyssey of transformation" as Sting puts it. The author's very human, painful, yet effusive journey to wakefulness is a very dramatic and fearless exploration which challenges all our conceptions of time and mind, uncovering the fatal defects and flaws that we have built our whole civilization upon. As he begins to unravel our social constructs and assumptions, our very way of perceiving and understanding our world, he is compelled to fashion sophisticated alternatives that 'rock the boat' of social and perceptual boundaries. He is then courageous enough to implement these alternative constructs in his own life, despite dire and disconcerting consequences, he dares to live an authentic life, true to his expanded vision, a life that fosters maximum freedom, evolution and interconnectedness, and he invites us to do the same.  As I concluded this book, the multitude of prophesies pointing toward the year 2012 as the "the end of a world and the opening of the next" were swimming in my head, and I felt sure Al Gore was right, there will be a rapid revolution in human consciousness, an awakening to the necessity for change, and we will soon find ourselves in a whole new world. 
 This book is the best in my library of gay related books. I read a lot and this one I think is the one that I read most. I read it over and over and it keeps getting better every time. It seems that I missed something the  first time I read this and then I read it again and picked up on other  things and then I keep reading it and keep picking up on things that I  missed. It's a good story of life of a gay man in the publics eye at all  times 
 If you're not familiar with Reba McEntire this CD would be the best place to begin.  It is the best of her greatest hits releases.  
 You don't have to be a fan of the original S&H TV series, in order to enjoy this movie....but it does help. Yes, I am a fan of the original series myself. When I heard they were doing this remake as a comedy, I was a little worried. But with Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn involved, I figured it had to be funny....and it is. The overall story is loosely based on the TV series, of course. The actual plot really doesn't matter. I think this movie does a good job of pleasing both fans of the TV show, and also trying to appeal to today's audience. Fans of the TV show will enjoy seeing the original car from the series, exactly as it looked back then. They will also enjoy a little touch of the original theme music, near the beginning of the film....and of course, cameos by original TV series stars Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. And of course, the combination of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson has a proven track record, and therefore should please today's audience. And at a running time of 1 hour and 40 minutes, this movie avoids being overly long....a definite plus. 
 These journals, are beautifully put together.  I remember when I found the first one and then each suceeding volume.  I knew this one was coming.  I even called the author at Guelph University to ask her how much longer I would have to wait.  She said then that they had to wait for some of the people in the journals to die before they could publish them.  I would guess Dr. Stuart Macdonald was one of them.    They thrill me and make me feel closer to thise amazing woman.  I've read everything she's written now.  The sad thing is that once this volume is finished there is nothing new to read.  My greatests thanks to L. M. Montgomery and to Drs. Rubio and Waterson for their great work 
 I love this book - such a great novel detailing the friendship and bonds of a group of women over the years.  I'll be re-reading it 
 This Cd made miss Flaw, singer Chris Volz former band. Flaw was a band that should have made it big in the world of hard rock, but both their albums, "Through the Eyes" and "Endangered Species" both scanned under 50,000 units, and the band broke up in frusteration. Now, Chris volz is back, and in as good as shape as ever. Musically, the band is very reminsicent of Flaw, with Chris tackling the same subjects as he ded with his former band. His lyrics are still pissed and raging, but also very sad and sowerful. Some of his songs made me realize that i'm not all alone in the way that i feel sometimes. A very inspirational band and singer, all in all. Check e m out. You wont be sorr 
 I've always heard Nat on movie soundtracks,Christmas carols,and in various other malls,friends houses,etc.But there is a distinct difference between just hearing and listening.I started watching reruns of his groundbreaking TV show on BETJ and was awestruck by the presence of his voice and personality.I'm not an expert on Nat King Cole by any stretch of the imagination,but when I listen to this CD(usually on Saturday or Sunday mornings)I am spellbound.This is a great crossection of an incredible artist and man 
 After watching "What the Bleep Do We know?" I intended on reading a little from each of the authors presented in this movie. She was the first.   This book takes you through the personal journey of Dr. Pert and how her personal life and her profession affect each other. Some may find this as a put-off, but I see it necessary to take the reader into an understanding of how she got from A to B. It gives credibility to her position as one reads her story.   Dr. Pert opened my eyes to the politics of being a scientist in today's world.  I felt her frustration of being a woman in her field among men.   This book opened my eyes to the possibilities of changing our current medical care and insurance support for such care based on her extensive knowledge of biology and pharmecuticals. Well, like a deflated balloon, she doesn't get full recognition or continued support for her AIDS breakthroughs in science, which implies a whole new form of medical healing from what we currently experience; where the cure isn't worse than the disease.    It's possible that her methods show a great potential for healing faster, easier and less costly - and that alone may be enough for financial supporters to shy away from her.  There's no money in health, only in disease and it's constant, illusive, extended methods towards the idea of healing - while ignoring how energy plays a part of it all. Meanwhile, we all pay a hefty price with our lives, time, and money. As Fred Flinstone says, "How droll.  Very droll."     Anyway, after reading her book, I found myself feeling confirmed in my conviction of using modern pharmecuticals as a LAST resort to healing, never first. I also found myself re-thinking the unconventional uses of energy.  Kudos to Dr. Pert.    
 Hans Morgenthau is the "Iching" of all international relations authors.  He sets the precedents for all future relations with his analysis of the political environment throughout the world.  He discusses the status quo, imperialism, neo-realism, moralism, diplomacy, disarmament, international governments, universalism, etc... This book is definitely a must read for any student intending on success in international relations 
 I was very pleased with both the product and the service 
 I could not carry on with life as I know it without the Economist.  No hype. It's that good.  This American reviewer became hopelessly addicted to the Economist's news and analysis during four years in England. The magazine - or 'newspaper', as it stubbornly insists on calling itself - is published from London, though as of 2005 the largest national readership is in the United States.  The editorial line is libertarian in the more moderate European sense of the word. The essential values are individual liberty, a modest state, and free market economics.  Don't let the name fool you. This weekly is far more than an economist's rag. Its anonymous writing on current events if fabulous, not to mention top-ranked analysis of letters, arts, and the like.  Let me give you a concrete example of how the Economist excels. For years, I have paid close attention to its coverage of Latino and immigration issues in the USA. One might suppose that a British magazine would be at a disadvantage when exploring this complex topic, yet the Economist's coverage routinely surpasses that of US newspapers and magazines, perhaps largely because of its disdain for self-suppressing 'PC' tactics.  The only area in which I detect broad deficiency in this magazine's coverage is in the role of religion, particularly in America. The secularist European spectacles its editors wear seem to make it impossible for them to canvass this phenomenon with a view that religion's continued fervor in advanced Western nations is something other than retrograde and slightly amusing.  I tell my university-age nephews - thankfully, they ask - to anchor their news consumption in one weekly, then to read widely beyond it. The Economist is the very best anchor available to English-reading sailors 
 Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain changed me.  As a writer, he really showed me how much I need to learn.    Mr. Frazier's bold use of period music throughout the novel has inspired me to reach deeper into research for my own books.  Beyond that, his careful, precise use of language kept me hooked throughout the pages of this wonderful story.  I enjoyed the cadence and the way new words from that era captured my thinking.  I say "new" but they're really old words that have evolved or dropped from modern usage.    Deep in the heart of this rich, colorful narrative you'll find a tender love story.  You'll also find the land lovingly described in a rich tapestry woven together as only Mr. Frazier seems capable of these days.    The war and it's brutality is described in some detail, but it only serves as the backdrop to Inman's struggle to return home to his true love and the country he knows and loves.  Being a person that loves the mountains and desires a simpler life, I found myself identifying with Inman from the very beginning.    While the film was okay, forget it and buy the book.  There is no way to translate to film what Mr. Frazier has accomplished with the language and the music.  Simply put, I love the way he describes the sound of the music.  Try and describe the sound of music sometime.  It's not easy.  Especially the type of music described here.    There are many surprises in this novel, but from my perspective, there is no way a thinking person can read this novel and NOT walk away a little bit richer, a little bit more fulfilled, and having their view of the world altered just a tiny bit.    Obviously I recommend this novel.  In my first novel, only one novelist made the acknowledgements portion of my book.  That person is Charles Frazier.  Thanks for the lessons, Mr. Frazier.  
 This was a very informative book.  I think everyone should read it and follow the good eating habits.  There is room to do what you want with the foods because not everyone is using it to lose weight.  Good sense will keep you healthy 
 I must say that when my girlfriend gave me this book, I thought it was a  strange choice for me, but as I read through, I found tons of useful information that would help a lot of bachelors.  I also think it would be a great book for married guys to score points with the wife!  The book itself is very well organized, broken down into different sections detailing helpful hints for all areas of the home.  This is one of those books that will stay on my bookshelf for a long time, and be referenced often. Great photos too! This would make a great gift for anyone 
 Perry Miller (1905-1963) was one of the most important of the consensus historians of the middle part of the twentieth century and his work on the American Puritans was required reading for all students of history when I attended graduate school in the late 1970s and early 1980s. "The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century" was one of his masterworks, exploring the intellectual history of the Puritans through a deep investigation of the thought of the Puritan divines. In this book, as well as its successor, "The New England Mind: From Colony to Province" (Harvard University Press, 1953), Miller asserted a single mind for America that could be traced to the Puritan belief system. Even while there was an "American mentality" it was tormented by self-doubt and a certain schizophrenia. He suggested that the spiritual unrest present among all Americans that may be traced to the early Puritans.   This volume emphasizes the rise of a religious utopian experiment by the Puritans. He finds much of value that the Puritans bequeathed to the United States and suggests that America has always been about noble ideals accepted by all. Miller's consensus interpretation celebrated the long tradition of shared American ideals and values while de-emphasizing conflict. He believed that this made the United States and the people that made it up somehow better than everyone else. Miller questioned the ideas and people who challenged the cherished principles that he saw so well expressed in the writings of Puritan elites, noting in many of them strains of authoritarianism, anarchy, and narrow- and simple-mindedness of all varieties. Much of this approach to the American past in vogue when Miller was involved in his work advocated a basic idealism that he believed was in constant jeopardy from forces of fear, anti-intellectualism, and authoritarianism present in society.   This is an important book, and having recently reread it, I find it still valuable as a statement of Puritan intellectual thought. Its creation of a single mindset, however, is certainly questionable. For instance, the "other" of Puritan society is not represented. What of the dispossessed, minorities of all types, non-Puritans, and women in Miller's recounting of Puritan thought? They are essentially omitted from the story and including their perspectives would certainly have altered Miller's account. His concept of Puritanism was essentially the same one that was offered by the elites of early New England. Nonetheless, this work represents a seminal statement in American historiography and remains worthy of consideration for any student of the subject 
 If you want music that is truly satanic, then look no further than "Dances Of Death." I like Classical music that has to do with death, and this one is no acception. Songs like "Dance Of The Macabre" are much better than those so-called Classical Opera works that don't have any feeling in them. This Cd truly has emotions that will chill you to the core. Highly recommended along with the three act Opera of The Omen. This is true Classical music. Buy it...if you dare

 I think, perhaps, people want to make this movie a more complicated study of "truth" than it is.  Fact is, it tells a simple story involving a simple truth: we have some base instincts and motivations which cannot always be denied by societal mores.  The film is not pleasing to those who want to see more "character development" for the same reason "Bridges of Madison County" was panned - the point of the movie was not who the characters were and why they became who they became.  The point was, two similar spirits met, mingled and, for the moment, loosed themselves from artificial restraint.  The relationship between the two main characters in this film had no chance of developing into anything beyond lust and rutting for the satisfaction of that lust.  The "Damage" occurs because the lusty rutting offends so many fundamental mores.  As the situation between the two "lovers" develops it becomes less and less human until it finally is beyond any control - the lust becomes an addiction as destructive as the worst kind of drug addiction.  It doesn't simply "spin" out of control - the destructive energy builds until it cannot be contained.  The energy is such that it sucks its other, unaware to that point, victims into its vortex and they all are devoured - the damage is total destruction of life as it had been only a short time before.  The film should prompt thoughts about the "artificial" restraints on "normal" urges and instincts.  What's wrong with two people being physically attracted and doing the things these people do? What's wrong with the same kinds of people who rolled together on the kitchen floor in "Bridges of Madison County?"  Does "love" require fidelity?  Should we not - as humans - be at all concerned about the emotional damage we can cause to ourselves and those we love by not restraining a natural urge?    This movie is a train wreck from the opening scene.  It's something you might want to look away from - but just can't.  It might disgust you but it also might thrill you.  It's the reason people listen to shock radio and watch soap operas.  It's the reason people say our society has gone or is going to hell.  It's our base nature that we like to think we don't have or, at least, have under control.  It's what happens when - if - we ignore our humanity and give head to our basest instincts.  When you watch it, don't just watch it.  Let yourself go.  And then, at the end, wonder if it was a dream you'd enjoy as a reality or if you are relieved it was just a dream.  It's a phenomenal movie 
 Wow!  I can't believe it's April 2006 and I am just now finding out about J.A. Konrath and Whiskey Sour.  I am a pretty picky reader and a book has to be horrible or fantastic for me review it.  I kiss a lot of frogs.  Whiskey Sour turned out to the handsome prince of a lifetime.  Great writing, great editing, awesome character development and a thrilling ride!  I am on my way to the bookseller today to purchase the next book in the series, Bloody Mary!.  Keep em comin' 
 I bought this product from Amazon.com with some discount. So I got a best product that can play all kinds of music in best quality at an affordable price. And the plus thing is that it is SONY. I always liked SONY. But, there is one thing, I think that SONY these days is charging more for its brand name. So if it tries to keep the prices reasonable, it will be the best. I bought this product because I was getting a discount on it 
 Imagine a Sherlock Holmes from the 6th century China, complete with flowy beards and costumes to match. Folklores. Long horse rides. Noodles and ricewine in roadside restaurants. Mysterious drunks and poets in clandestine wenches. Warriors turned highway men. Weretigers (I had to look it up), the feline equivalents of werewolves.   And cast amidst this historically vivid milieu, a gory murder of a district magistrate, whose ghost has scared many since his sudden demise.    For its twisted and edge-of-the-seat plot alone, this hidden little gem bags my higest recommendation. Most mystery thrillers have the reader thinking of  prospective culprits as they read along, but I had a tough time establishing some sort of motive or identifying targets until nearly the end of the Gold Murders.   And that's only half the fun. Gulik's measured prose has a cultured elegance that brings China's simple yet layered world of nearly two centuries ago springing back to life. It's witty. It's ribald, with a tight economy of description, which makes it twice as juicy. And it's chockfull of deceit and honour in the noblest of ways.   An engaging but human good old fashioned tale of intrigue. Easily one of the best detective novels I've ever had the luxury of devouring.  
 When I first saw this movie all I could think about was Logan's Run. I still do. Both movies deal with conformity and escape from a totalitarian world run by something computer-like. Matrix kicks it up a notch and is more entertaining and more technologically advanced (the original is from 1976?). I loved it a lot 
 This is the second of two parts dealing with the sickness and death of Nita's mom.  Nita's family has pretty much shut down in the wake of her mother's passing and each is going through grieving in their own way.  For Juanita, she has withdrawn into her own shell and lost much of the energy and drive that was her trademark up until now.  She is keeping Kit at arm's length and avoiding wizardly assignments.  This is doubly hard on her wizard friend who not only misses companionship and support, as well as desperately wanting Nita to feel better.  Kit (and Ponch the universe traveling wonder dog) has his hands full when he is asked to investigate the case of Darryl McAllister, a young Wizard who has gone on his ordeal, and is very late completing it.  It's not that Darryl has come to harm, it's simply that his quest may be stuck.  What Kit doesn't expect is that Darryl is a very special child.  In the mundane world, he is autistic, and Kit has no idea how to communicate with him.  Kit, suffering from his inability to help Nita, throws himself into trying to fix Darryl's problem.  In doing so he may very well endanger himself.  Nita, experimenting with lucid dreaming, finds herself in contact with a strange character that may appear as a knight, a robot, or even a clown.  She too experiences communication problems that cause her to expand her knowledge of the speech.  What she finds is that her experiences and Kit's may be related.  And that Darryl may be considerably more than he seems - a wizard with special powers locked in a struggle with the Lone Power.  By some odd coincidence, this is the second novel in a row where one of the main characters has been autistic.  While Diane Duane doesn't do a deep dive into the psychology involved, she manages to capture the essence of at least one variety of autistic experience.  For all the participants, communication is the abiding theme of the book both for self-understanding as well as for reaching out to others.  As such, A Wizard Alone is a touching story on many levels.  This and The Wizard's Dilemma are both emotionally difficult reading, but I feel they do an excellent job of making that difficulty understandable 
 I started a bible study at home and noticed that my kids (ages 7, 10, and 13) were taking too long to understand and relate the new testament to the old testament stories, so I started my search for a good book to use in my bible study with my little kids.  I saw some example pages on Amazon and fall in love with it. My kids are so happy with this book that they do not want to stop reading it. It is so easy explanatory for kids and it shows the bible chapters from where the stories summary were taken, so that the older can read more about it, thus the pictures are great.   I liked it so much that I started purchasing this book as a gift to friends and relatives. It is wonderful to spread the knowledge of the bible with a gift like this.  Great recommended book.  God Bless You.. 
 I buy lots of toy books and this one is really special as it has such unusual ones. Most of the yarns are Rowan dk so really you can use almost any worsted yarn in acrylic or wool or mixed. The snake is very colorful but so is the turtle which is not often made. There are some cute boy and girl dolls, a 24" cheeky monkey with very long legs and arms. There's even a robot. I'm not sure about the snappy crocodile (kind of scary), but the little mice and the big elephant are delightful. Other items are: fairy, cat, cow, chick, pig, finger puppets, flat ted, big foot bunny, dog, dinosaur, butterfly, owl, ball, fish on the line. Pictures are also good as you can see how the children relate to the toys. 
 I've been going to De La Salle football games for a long time now, ever since "the streak" started.  Like most people that follow the program, I would always find myself asking "How do they do it"?  How do they win so many games against the high level of compitetion that they play?  This excellent documentary answers all of these questions and the answers are not what you would think.  They do it by getting the kids to commit to each other, to their community, and to themselves.  By following around the coaches and players for a year, the viewer is able to get direct insight into the program.  It is almost surreal to see how well the kids bond to one another through these techniques; teenage boys crying and telling each other how much they love and mean to one another.  You don't even have to have an interest in football to enjoy this film.  If you are at all interested in the development and education of young men and women then this film will do you great good.  
 Matthew Sweet's albums released since 100% Fun have shown an increasing willingness to cave in to his own personal eccentricities. Living Things is no exception. Many of these songs are a little corny, silly, etc. I enjoy his carefree style of songwriting, and his willingness to experiment with different instruments and sounds, but his songs seem more impersonal since the days of Girlfriend, Altered Beast, and 100% Fun. Or if they are personal, they are about matters that are less close to his heart. I find his earlier albums much more emotionally involving. But what hasn't changed is his ability to write a killer tune. And there are about 5 such killer tunes on Living Things, that would rank right up there with his best ever in my opinion, which makes it well worth owning. And while I just criticized the change in his approach to song writing over the years, I must say that this is his best sounding album since 100% Fun. It doesn't sound gimicky or poorly produced, which has really hurt his last few albums 
 I don't remember buying this CD, but I certainly remember the first time I played it.  It is a fantastic collection of Louisiana Blues and Zydeco.  Particularly like 'Festis', but really all of it is good 
 i read Rocket Boys, which i loved, and then moved on to the Coalwood Way.  i was rather disappointed when i started it. it wasn't that it was about a period of time covered in rocket boys - i knew that already.  but what i loved about rocket boys was the portrayal of a small town, and the coalwood way basically repeats that subject, which i think was pretty well covered already in Rocket boys.  so this book isn't a must-read, like rocket boys. but it's still pretty good, as i discovered after getting throught the first couple introductory chapters (which mostly just repeated things said in rocket boys). there's still plenty of new plot material - there's dreama, a girl living with an abusive man out of wedlock, who just wants to be accepted by the town's women. then there's sonny's girl-related woes, mostly centered around a girl named ginger (there's very litttle dorothy plunk, for those of you sick of her from rocket boys). then there's sonny's relationship with both his parents, and with his brother. (sonny is homer, in case you don't know.)  this is sort of an alternative to rocket boys, telling some of the same messages from different angles. if you've already read rocket boys, read some of the other books on your list first 
 Malamud has a way with narrative so that at the first word you are hooked and you can't put the book down till the story is over.  His prose style is smooth and transparent, and his characters are idiosyncratic.  My favorite  stories were The German Refugee, Man in the Drawer, Black Is My Favorite  Color, Zora's Noise and Rembrandt's Hat. But all of them are worthwhile 
 My son first latched on to this Mother Goose collection at about 21 months, and for the last 3 months, we've read the whole thing through nearly every day.  He'll spend 30 or 45 mintues with me, reading the rhymes, enjoying the songs (there are several for which the tunes are fairly well known), and looking forward to the ones such as "patty cake" which have a game attached to them.  While he's got a pretty decent attention span for his age, this is by far the activity he'll do for the longest time.  He's starting to learn the rhymes himself now, and it's become a very participatory activity to read it with him.  I'm enjoying it tremendously, with the warm and fuzzy, family-celebrating illustrations, the inclusion of many of my childhood favorites, and some old rhymes which are new to me, and very charming (Wibbleton to Wobbleton, for example, and The Big Ship Sails on the Alley, Alley Oh).  I've hidden the other Mother Goose collections we were given as gifts, because I find this by far the most appealing, in its choices of rhymes and songs, the charm of its illustrations, and its uncrowded layouts which don't squeeze too much text onto the pages 
 Is a great way to turn whole beans/peas into "fast food" with the help of a grain grinder.  Refried beans in just 5 minutes!  Wonderful ideas 
 Heart Seizure is a political satire that will keep the pages turning.  Fitzhugh is an incredibly intelligent writer with a knack for plot twists and intersections that will keep your head spinning.  He does a breathtaking job of taking something that most people despise and turning it into something that we can laugh at, showing the ridiculousness of it all 
 This case is really outstanding! I tried a few others and this one really is the best. The camera fits in easily and is easy to access, plus it looks great. A very quality case 
 This book was a great book because it kept you interested and it was very well written. I rate it four stars because it kept my attention and an overall great plot. I dont think this book would deserve a 5 because it could have been more suspenseful. I would recommend this book to anybody that loves mystery bookz 
 This book is great to calm you down and to give you explanations about your children's transformation into a "normal horrible" teenager. It helped me put back some humor and perspective on the whole situation. The rationale behind the behavior helps you understand what is going on during this growth period and even though it does not give you a magic wand, you can avoid falling into the fights and arguments with your daughter so easily. Also it reassures you that it is important to set rules and that they need and want the rules and limits 
 I read this wonderful book in one sitting. If I have any complaint, it was too short. This is a story about family and relationships when faced with the unexpected.  I too am an OB nurse, and have many times seen the opposite situation..the infant of African-Americans who looks "white." I have spent hours in my career reassuring these fathers. But even more important, Family Tree is about accepting all children, no matter their skin color, hair color (red hair in boys can be a disappointment for some shallow people)or a congenital impairment.  Love and acceptance is all children need.  Barbara Delinsky has told a beautiful story, and I thank her. This is an example of why I fell in love with books 
 Only Genesis seems to divide fans even stronger between eras.  I love the jazz-rock stuff from the 60's and 70's as well as the power ballads of the 80's.    As someone who thinks both versions of the band were great, even though a lot of the magic was lost when Cetera left in 1985, they still had a number of good A-sides through the rest of the decade, "Look Away" was one of their biggest ever hits, and Cetera was gone by then.  This is some of the most beautifully produced and structured music ever recorded.  From the sonic beauty of "Wishing You Were Here", to the hard rock of "I'm A Man" through to encompass such bystandings as disco (Alive Again) and 80's rock (Stay The Night), Chicago are true innovators and a group that made a little something for everyone.  If you only like the jazz-rock, Rhino recently reissued "Chicago IX-Greatest Hits".  If you only like the 80's power ballads, "Greatest Hits 1982-1989" is still in print (the 1981 "Greatest Hits Vol. 2" which covered the middle years of 1975-1980, including such big hits as "If You Leave Me Now", "No Tell Lover" and "Baby What A Big Surprise" is inexplicably out of print).  However, to me, this collection supercedes the three previous collections into a nice, relatively inexpensive package and is definately the one to get if your horizons are open to liking both "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?" and "Hard Habit To Break" 
 Despite what many will say about this book, Ravi Zacharias is one of the best writers found within Christianity today.  Can man live without God?  No.  But, sadly enough, there's plenty of people (such as such popular Christianphobics and Godphobics like Dawkins and Sam Harris) out there willing to give it a try.  Thus a book like this is both helpful and, sadly, not helpful to Christians such as you and I.  It is helpful because, truth be told, not truth made by man but truth brought forth by God, only (as God Himself points out aplenty) a fool could look around and say there is no God.  One of the biggest problems with apologetics is that you can have all the proof in the world for such things as Jesus Christ, Intelligent Design, and so forth, but a blind man will still be a blind man if there is no recognition of blindness.  And thus the atheist and the humanist sinks deeper and deeper into his own self worship--worshiping himself as his own god because there is no other god but the atheist's/humanist's ego.  Worship that involves nihilism dressed as "reasoning," while believing such matrixes as evolution as the Genesis of man.    Still, a work like this by Zacharias helps you and I to realize just how sinful we ourselves are and our sinful the world is.  The world around us is filled with poverty, school shootings, war, rumors of war, and so much more--and if the humanists truly bring America into being a secular nation, a nation that is politically correct toward all but Christians (which is what the atheist and the humanist liberal wants to do), then we will indeed see more of these social and global travesties.  I dare say that this is true, that the more the atheists and the humanists secularize the world, the more kids you will see shot at schools, the more drugs you will see sold in the corporations, the more teen pregnancies and abortions you'll see in the clinics.  Why?  Because to try to live without God means that you have no comprehension of morality, truth, and life everlasting.  We cannot live without God, and we who call upon the Lord through Jesus Christ must recognize this empirical paradigm--we cannot live a life in this world, truly live a life in this world, if we do not recognize our base need to be with our Heavenly God through Jesus Christ.  We must have God just as we must have breath, we must have God just as we must have our blood coursing through our veins.  We cannot live life without God because we would be turning our back on true life, eternal true life, that is found only in God through Jesus Christ.    As Zacharias points out in chapter after chapter, the atheist truly has no reasoning and "logic" and "comprehension."  The atheist has no answers toward those pressing questions that we all feel--from questions about suffering, questions about loneliness, questions about insecurity, questions about history and the lives of man in history.  The atheist only believes that man must always be his own god so that man will know (or so the atheist believes, as Zacharias points out) how to truly live life.  Yet man is blind.  Man is deaf.  Only God, as Zacharias points out, can fully answer our questions if we truly seek Him to answer these questions.  We may have doubts, we may have tears, but if we truly allow God--in the fullness of time and place and station--to bring us the answers, then indeed we will have those answers.  And those questions will always lead to the utmost of truths, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Son of Man who came into this world through virgin birth, lived a life of sinlessness, healed the sick, made the blind man see, spoke to the heart and the mind and the soul, then died upon the Cross and rose again on the Third Day so that we (through Him who brings us to the Father) will have eternal life.  Still, though we truly must stand against the humanist and their full desire to destroy by their own version of apologetics this country and our children in this country and this world.  This can be done only through faith in God through Christ and living a life for our Lord God.  We must not be egotistical ourselves, nor must we think of ourselves as better than them.   We are just as poor as they are, spiritually, physically, we need God just like they do...the only difference is that Christ has opened our eyes because we have truly desired for Christ to open our eyes to our own self poverty.  Yes we must have love for these sinners who are just as sinful as we are.  For these people are those who need God through Christ just as much as we need God through Christ.  Furthermore, we must also have pity toward these poor misguided fools (not my words, but God's position toward those who fail to see Him when He is there clear as day) who only desire is for their own self interest.    Thus I say to you that you must witness to the atheist, not through badgering or through heckling, but through love...the love of Christ that is suppose to shine in our hearts and minds and souls.  We must do this because we must show the world that God so loved the World that He gave His only Son so that we wont have to die eternally, but instead have everlasting real life reasoned life in Him.  Read this book by Zacharias, and I dare say to read his other fine books.  His works will help you to understand your own need, your own desires, your own doubts, and your own hopes that can be answered by just laying them before the Resurrected One.  
 This is the original Chicken Soup book. It was filled with all kinds of various good true stories 
 I own the single books from Dini/Ross teamup. Great books. They capture the essence of each character to build upon it a very meaningful and clever tale. Nothing to add about the art: Ross is well known and always getting better and better, with panels as evocative as the prose. The hardcover edition is the perfect way to enjoy these masterpieces (even if a bit heavy to handle.....). But if you are looking for extra material (as the new edition of Mythology) you could be disappointed 
 Not just a primal rocker whose influence on those who came after oozes out of every track...the man could flat out play!!  Carl was a superb guitar player and never better than in these Sun cuts.  Listen and enjo 
 Her Witts About Her:Self-Defense Sucess Stories by Wom 
 this is so far the best house building book . It went into the details of house construction, one thing though is Habitat is a charitable organization therefore it does not go into too much business management stuff about O-B. and as most experienced O-B knows, the success or failure of a project is not the technical details but rather it is the budget and time control and management stuff 
 Charismatic televangelist Jackson Wilde has targeted Claire Laurent and her lingerie catalog as tools of the devil. When Wilde turns up dead, Claire is the prime suspect, much to New Orleans District Attorney Robert Cassidy's plight, as he's falling for the alluring woman who just might be a murderer. This is foreign territory for a tough as nail prosecutor who never mixes business with pleasure.  While it looks like Claire might have done it (and she's without an alibi), there are a host of others out there with motive to kill not so squeaky clean preacher, including his latest wife and son, who are having a hot affair. But as Robert uncovers yet another lie that Claire has told him, will be able to forgive her?   Featuring a spunky heroine with a backbone, sexy hero, plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing and lots of steamy love scenes, this is Brown at the top of her game, and one of her most sensual and enduring stories. A definite must read 
 There are lots of little tidbits of info to be gleaned from this cool little book. Hundreds of cult films are included, though there are some I wouldn't have included (like APOLLO 13, THE PERFECT STORM, SEE SPOT RUN and TITANIC), and some they overlooked (THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, GREASE, THE MATRIX, etc.), but overall this volume has a nice mixture of titles, broken down into many categories and a handy index. Recommended for movie buffs everywhere 
 I wanted to purchase this book for awhile.  I am glad that I finally bought it.  It is a large volume.  I purchased the new hardcover as I expected to keep it for awhile.  These are the old stories of Italy, both folklore and fairy tales.  If you're a lover of either of those two types of stories and want to learn more about the culture of Italy, I would recommend this book to you.  
 This was an enjoyable book from the first page to the last.  We all have moments of coincidence and this book puts into perspective that these moments do not "just happen"...putting the focus on God. I love the imagery of God "winking" at such a moment as if to say, "Hey there kid, I'm thinking about you right now."  Now whenever a coincidence happens in my life, I find myself winking back to say, "Thank You, God...I'm thinking about You right now, too!"  Very well written.  Hats off to SQuire Rushnell for an exceptionally good book 
 Bush was the top band back in its day.  Their other albums are just as good as this one, but this album seems to have had the most popularity.  If you don't know much about Bush yet, this album would be the best start 
 Contains a wide ranging collection of one and two sentence bits of advice. For a more comprehensive discussion of the same topics, you might want to also look at COLLEGE LIFE 102: The No-Bull Guide to a Great Freshman Year 
 This book would be especially helpful for someone starting a new financial planning practice.  The CD-ROM includes forms like a sample client contract, an investment policy statement and a load of other forms that would take hours to come up with on your own. Little things like a sample of her own ADV are also very useful if you are trying to set up a practice and wade through the maze of paperwork that will be required.  While the book gives some practical advice on planning which may or may not be useful, depending on how experienced the planner is, the disk alone is worth the price of the book.  One reviewer stated that the book isn't of much use to a broker/planner at a large firm (they have their own forms and procedures) but for an independent planner it's perfect

 Like so many I guess, I seriously got into horse racing after I'd seen the Seabiscuit movie.... I went on reading Hillenbrand's book and from there on, I was helplessly done in. I moved up to Man O' War, from there to Secretariat, and finally I found this book. I was thrilled and still am. While of course virtually every horse's position in these top hundred is arguable, like the editors do acknowledge in the very introduction and as everyone may see for themselves in some fierce reviews of the book right here, I think this is not the real point of this book. I see it as a fantastic collection of all these magnificient champions I guess none of us would want to miss today. Whichever horse is first, second or last, these were all outstanding creatures that had the heart and soul, courage and strength to compete like they did. They lifted everyone up as they soared across the dirt or turf, they made and still make us dream. To have them all together in one book with pedigrees and pictures is awesome. I am way too young (and moreover not american) to have seen the better number of them run, but I keep coming back to this book with the same fascination every time. It sends me dreaming, trying to imagine and of course... wanting more. Like one other reviewer, I think it's a great starting point for anyone who's gotten interested in horse racing. Enjoy  
 This quite frankly is my most favorite Peter White cd.  You can play the first eight tracks without having to press the "next" button on your cd player.  Actually, the last two tracks aren't bad either.  Perfect Moment, the fourth track on this cd, can easily make anyone reminisce.  The sixth track, Autumn Day, adds a change in style by giving some beat to the cd as well as midnight in manhattan.  Totally have to recommend this one for anyone looking for a solid smooth jazz cd 
 Stevie Thomas and Susan Carol Anderson got their "fifteen minutes of fame" after helping to unravel the Final Four mystery involving the blackmailing of Minnesota State University's star player, Chip Graber. Remaining good friends, they keep in touch over email and IM all the time. When Susan Carol tells Stevie she'll be covering the U.S. Open for her local sports paper, she convinces Stevie to come along. Stevie contacts Bobby Kelleher, the Washington Herald columnist who mentored them during the Final Four, and sure enough Kelleher has a job for Stevie too. They're off to New York City, but little do they know what they'll have in store for themselves.  Right before her anticipated first game, young Russian phenom Nadia Makarova goes missing and immediately Stevie and Susan Carol find themselves trying to unfold another mystery. And yet again, there are a lot of unanswered questions. Who are Nadia Makarova's kidnappers? Why does Susan Carol's agent uncle, Brendan Gibson, seem like he's right in the middle of this? Plus, what does this mean for up-and-coming new U.S. tennis star Evelyn Rubin, who is smashing her way through games and scheduled to play Makarova?  VANISHING ACT is John Feinstein's follow-up to the New York Times bestseller, LAST SHOT. The author, a political and sports reporter for the Washington Post as well as Sports Illustrated and National Sports Daily, has written many bestselling sports-related books. In his second effort Feinstein continues to succeed, mixing real-life sports personalities like Bud Collins and Andy Roddick into the fictional world. Feinstein also reveals a behind-the-scenes look at sports agents that doesn't portray them in a very good light.  Like his previous effort, VANISHING ACT provides an almost nonfiction-like look into the professional tennis world and the U.S. Open while mixing elements of a fiction mystery novel. Readers will be happy to see the return of Stevie and Susan Carol, who have clearly grown as friends. (And Stevie's constant eating of hamburgers and pizza in an effort to grow taller is pretty humorous too.) VANISHING ACT is a fast-paced story that whizzes by like a powerful serve. It's a fun read for anyone interested in tennis or mysteries, or both.     --- Reviewed by Kristi Olso 
 Great book which does a lot more than adorn your coffee table. Excellant reference 
 Re-mastered and expanded, 'The Worst Of Jefferson Airplane' has been re-released to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Jefferson Airplane's first album release. To the original 15 tracks (allegedly selected by the band themselves in 1970) Bob Irwin has added "Watch Her Ride" and "Greasy Heart", chronologically half way through the record. With various 'Best Of' and 'Essential' JA collections out now I just wonder why they chose to mess with the original format - and having decided to do so, why they didn't add more tracks to make best use of the CD running time. For a longer review check out 'HOLDING TOGETHER' (my Airplane/Starship fanzine). The addition of "Let's Get Together", "Share A Little Joke", "Hey Fredrick" etc could have made this even 'worse' and the quite definitive single CD set 
 Have always loved Clark G. :)  The chemistry between Mr. G. and Doris Day is good, the movie is fluff, but a lot of fun 
 This is one of those books that make me glad my native tongue is Spanish. A warning, tough: This book is full of Mexican Slang (Even I, being Mexican, had trouble understanding some words!) So, even if your Spanish is good, I would recommend reading the translated work, unless you have, or have had, contact with the Mexican Culture (i.e. You have lived in Mexico). Other than that, I understand the English translation is very good. So, forget about the reviews and start reading "Queen". It is as addictive as the drugs its characters deal with. Four and a half stars 
 I bought this for my sister as a Christmas gift. I was so glad I was able to find it, since Fiestaware Black is retired. This item was shipped promptly, packaged very well, and arrived in perfect condition. I am very pleased with this transaction and my sister was thrilled with her gift 
  I have had serious anxiety problem for over 20 years. Lucinda is the best and most informative author of this disorder that I've ever heard of.

 `In the Heat of the Kitchen' by London chef Gordon Ramsay, the host of a Fox TV culinary show, `Hell's Kitchen', which I have not had the pleasure of seeing. Ramsay is the partner and executive chef for three restaurants in and around London and his writing is entirely different than his two countrymen, Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson. Both Oliver and Ramsay are professionals down to the tips of their asbestos-conditioned fingers, but where Oliver revels in simple dishes a la River Caf and the Mediterranean cuisines, Ramsay is very much a French influenced chef.  Before I get too far afield, I must say I think this is an excellent book on cooking, even if some of the recipes may be just a bit impractical for the casual amateur cook.  To explain, cookbooks can be divided into at least seven different categories and the criteria for judging a book depends on the category into which it falls. There are:  Textbooks such as the CIA's `New Professional Chef' and Jacques Pepin's `Complete Techniques' Great Collections such as the `Joy of Cooking' and `James Beard's American Cookery' National or Regional Cuisine Collections such as Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' Restaurant `haute cuisine' such as Joel Robuchon's `Simply French' and Thomas Keller's books. Entertaining cookbooks such as Martha Stewart's classic `Entertaining' and Gourmet magazine books Special Subjects such as Alice Waters' `Chez Panisse Fruits' or Rachael Ray's '30 Minute Meal' books Moneymaking Cookbooks promoting a person or an organization. Local fundraising cookbooks and non-chef (Patti LaBelle, Al Roker, etc) books fall into this category. Celebrity Chef / Restaurant cookbooks from people such as Emeril Lagasse, Tyler Florence, Jamie Oliver, Rocco DiSpirito, and dozens of others.  The last category generally provides value by including the virtues of at least one or more of the other major categories added the cachet obtained by being able to say you are cooking a recipe from Babbo or Caf Boulud or Lespanisse or Sara Moulton or Ina Garten.  Ramsay's book is certainly a member of this last category with a strong grounding in the `haute cuisine' category. Ramsay makes no pretensions that his dishes are easy to make. His primary influence is clearly French and Spanish, primarily Catalan (Barcelona) techniques plus the rich range of American ingredients. His book is the perfect example of the kind you would want in a library by your best armchair, where you want to read it carefully for ideas in creating your own recipes. The first thing which comes to mind as I read the book is Bob Kinkead's statement that he owns about 1200 cookbooks, but he has never followed the recipe in any of them, step for step. Rather, he reads and `digests' their ideas that become ideas he puts into his own recipes.  The first thing I like about Ramsay's book is that it has chapters based on ingredients. I have seen several books recently with all sorts of whiz-bang chapter titles that mean practically nothing when you pull the book off your shelves and glance at the table of contents. Some of these books are good, but their organization is not to their credit.  Ramsay's chapters are:  Shellfish, with an emphasis on American blue crabs plus oysters, clams, langoustines, and scallops. Fish, with red mullet, cod salmon, tuna and a few unusual species such as skate and monkfish. Poultry and Game Birds, where he addresses the perennial question of how to deal with different cooking times for white and dark meat. I recommend you give his solution a try when roasting chicken. Meat, with a very nice selection of recipes for braised pork, filet mignon, stuffed roast lamb, tomatoes stuffed with chili, veal and foie gras, and a new perspective on sauteeing calves liver. Pasta and Rice, with an emphasis on risottos, stuffed pastas, and spatzle (German pasta / dumplings) Vegetables, with several recipes for soups and salads. First time I've seen a fondue of lettuce! Eggs, one of my very favorite subjects, which Ramsay does to a tee. Perfect omelet and fried egg recipes. Since all recipes are organized by primary ingredient, many of the dessert recipes fall in this egg chapter and the following chapter on fruits. Fruit with sorbets, sherbets, gelatins, walnut cake, great pain perdu (French toast) with peaches and berry kebabs. Flour, with breads, pastries, and cakes. I invariably give good scores to general cookbooks that have a good chapter on interesting bread baking. While his nibs Jamie Oliver does the easy Italian stuffed breads, Ramsay goes for things a bit more complicated but more interesting with a great sun-dried tomato fougasse (French for focaccia) plus a very nice recipe for a vanilla flavored pate sucree. Unlike the flaky style of pastry Americans use for pies where the butter must stay cold and the dough must be handled with kid gloves, this dough is less delicate and fussy. The last chapter on stocks, sauces, and dressings has all the usual stuff, including a very nicely simple recipe for chicken stock. I really respect those who simmer their stock for half a day or overnight, but I personally prefer this simpler three-hour recipe.  Ramsay has a reputation for being very demanding in the kitchen, and his recipes benefit from his eye for detail. Many recipes are easily within the amateur's abilities and while there are a few which need more expensive and rare ingredients, you can trust that Ramsay is giving you some of the very best techniques for dealing with them, as he is for his egg and flour recipes.  This is an excellent book for cookbook readers and people who like to perfect simple dishes and try their hand at dishes that are both classic and just a bit unusual.  Very highly recommended. 
 The actors are great, the concept is clever, the script is sharp, and the direction is fast-paced. You won't give it a serious thought once you finish the viewing, except for the fact that you realize you won't mind seeing it again someday, because it gave you quite a nice time. 
 The truly amazing thing about this work is that it was written in PRISON as Boethius awaited execution (following judgment and conviction based upon spurious charges). Bearing that in mind as I read "The Consolation of Philosophy" (if anyone ever needed consolation, it was an innocent man awaiting his own death; Christians should be able to relate to that idea) made it all the more remarkable. If you ever feel that life isn't fair, that others have it "in" for you, that it's tough to get an even break, maybe reading this will put things in better perspective. If not, it won't be due to Boethius' shortcomings... 
 This book has so much valuable information to help you influence others to get more of the results you want. And it gives you this info in bite-sized chunks you can use and build on.   The book builds on the terrific work that Cialdini has done and reported in his books, which any student of influence will also buy and study. Hogan expands Cialdini's number of persuasion principles ("laws") from six to nine and fills the book with examples to teach you how to use them and scores of influence methods and techniques.   When we do choose to persuade someone, we want certain results. Anyone who consistently uses this book's simple model of outcome-based thinking will reap dollar benefits at least hundreds of times greater than the price of this book. And Hogan teaches you this in just ten pages.   Each chapter ends with a short summary in outline form. This helped me grasp the information the first time I read the book and has made it easy for me to quickly review the material when I've gone back to it.   I highly recommend that you buy and study this book, and then review the short chapter summaries from time to time.  
 Dr. Isaacs takes a subject that is coated in misconception and mythology and proceeds to strip away layer after layer of "conventional wisdom" about the war and its effects on American society to reveal  some ugly and painful truths. For me, the book was very good, but not as  good as his classroom lectures. I had Dr. Isaacs for a Vietnam class at  Towson University in the fall of 1997 and the range of that man's knowledge  and experience is truly, truly amazing. If you can't get to his classroom,  definitely get his book 
 The novel sizzles with mystery and intrigue as the characters pursue wealth and fame in so many ways in the 1930s.  There is a rich kid who turns to a life of crime, a kid who finds a new identity in fighting crime, a reporter who adds more myth to the mix of covering the cops and robbers, with their lives merging in a closing scene in a book that is one of the finest Elmore Leonard has written.  A number of characters that are introduced in this fast-moving novel propel the action, as good and evil seemingly embrace, then careen off into different directions, only to meet again.   Set in an era of Prohibition, speakeasies, gun molls and tommy guns as hot as the souped-up rides used to rob banks or chase the crooks, The Hot Kid is a great and highly believable novel 
 I wasn't expecting much from these little speakers, but I must admit that I've never heard music sound so clear before.  Granted, I've never owned a really expensive stereo system, but I didn't realize what a laptop computer and Bose speakers could do.  If you want big bass sound or extreme volume, then look elsewhere.  But if you want clear sound, decent bass, 2 small speakers and low price, then these are excellent. 
 In the spring of 2000, I was sitting in the admissions office at Hampshire College, waiting to be interviewed.  With some time to kill, I browsed a bookshelf featuring the works of Hampshire professors.  One of these books was Wisconsin Death Trip.  It caught my attention thanks to the Static-X album of the same name (of which I was a big fan at the time...no longer, though), so I pulled it from the shelf to find that haunting cover photo staring at me with its dark, blurry eyes.  It drew me in, in a way that was far from comfortable.  It left me no choice.  I had to see what was inside. As it turned out, I had a long wait for my interview, and I made it through most of the book.  If it had been anything other than a sunny spring afternoon, I doubt the interview would have gone well at all.  Suicide and murder, madness and despair, babies in coffins and grim stone-faced Lutherans.  The images were haunting, and those conjured up by the simple matter-of-fact accounts even more so.  This book haunted me.  Fast forward a year and a half, and I'm a first-year student at Hampshire.  I walk into the bookstore and what do I see but Wisconsin Death Trip.  I'm short on cash, but I buy it.  I haven't really got a choice.  Just about everyone who comes into my room gets to look at it.  Fortunately, this is Hampshire College, so that probably helps my social life a bit.  Four years later, the Death Trip still holds a prominent place on my shelf.  Every so often I take it out and open it, and inevitably I end up reading it cover to cover.  This book is powerful, haunting, and above all else important.  Uncomfortable as it may be, this is American history.  This is a tale of the price we pay for progress.  These are the souls who were caught in the gears of the machine.  In my time at Hampshire I had Mr. Lesy as a teacher.  Towards the end of the semester, I asked him why he felt compelled to write this book.  He told me that after looking through the images and articles used herein, that he realized that he was looking at "an American Holocaust."  And that, he felt, was something that people needed to know about.  I wholeheartedly agree.    Pick up this book and you will not put it down 
 If you dig the Dead then you already know about this CD, awsome acoustic set. This is a must for old and new Deadheads. TCBRN. Simpsonville, SC 
 This personal account of Pascal Khoo Thwe's life works for me on many levels. I feel as if I understand what it is like to belong to a culture so different from my own. His writing was deeply moving and so descriptive that I do believe I can feel and experience how his culture lived.   I wonder at the cruelty of human beings and I ponder this horror, especially in the aftermath of the disclosure of American torture of prisoners.   I think about how the author struggled with the ability to make judgements during his time at Cambridge because of living his life under an authoritnarian regime. He had no experience of forming opinions and I understand now how Russians are having difficulty with a democratic constitution and are regressing to authoritariasm. So goes Iraq?  I wonder at a jungle and climate and the paradise he describes.  I think that the reader,myself was not up to the job when I skipped quite a bit of the jungle fighting toward the end.   I would have liked to know more of how he was able to make friends at Cambridge which he only hinted at.Maybe another book 
 This was my first Spenser novel, either printed or audio. I was fascinated by Parker's direct sentences and his style of "he said" - "she said". Joe Mantegna delivers Parker's dry humor perfectly. The characters are full and well-developed and the story flows easily. The author's background clearly shows in his literary references, with Spenser able to quote Shakespeare. Actually, I'm not sure if that occurred in this book or others of the Spenser series; as soon as I finished listening to this book, I went to the library and looked for other "Spensers". Despite Spenser's history of having served in the Korean War, been a police detective, and now a private investigator for a number of years, Spenser, like James Bond, is timeless and eternally around 40-ish. A very enjoyable story and audio rendition. Pay particular attention to Spenser's interactions with and descriptions of Rita Fiore. Priceless 
 I bought this book because one of best friends committed suicide and I wanted some answers. I have read all the reviews and was prepared to either believe or dismiss it as the delusions of a mourning mother. I never actually believed that Anne lied, but I was prepared to believe that Stephen's narration was just an illusion in her head, born out of a desperate need to believe that he is ok.  I just finished this book and even though on one hand some of Stephen's narration speaks to my heart, to a certain degree, in my opinion readers should be prepared to feel rather empty after reading this book. This book will not bring your loved one back. This book will not reassure you that your dead loved one is ok. Perhaps it will give you an idea of what afterlife is like, if you have a little faith, but the truth is, until you die and you meet your loved one and hear the truth personally, you will not rest.   I was surprised at Anne's honesty. It takes courage to admit to all the mistakes that she did. She was a bad mother. But she did try to do the best that she could under the circumstances. Her mistakes do not justify Stephen's death. You are either strong enough to handle what life throws at you or you are not. Stephen was not.   I do not believe that this book encourages suicide. I mean, Stephen's account of what happened to him after he died is not that great. It is only with time that the soul is able to find its way. But until that happens, it's not pretty.   I would recommend this book to people who want to reassure themselves that their loved one is ok, and I believe that there is a degree of truth in this book, but be prepared to remain feeling restless afterwards. Because whatever you read, whatever reassurance you get from any book, your son, daughter, relative or friend will never tell you face to face what really goes on. Unless you achieve the state of consciousness that Anne describes which allows her to talk to her son, which, if it is true, I hope that some day we can do that too.  If you are still looking for answers, I would recommend the "Conversations with God" trilogy by Neale MacDonald Walsh 
 Excellent book with eight fantastically different views on Leadership.  Describes fundamental differences between leadership and Management and brings forth thought process which can help professionals in all fields.   Contents are 1) The managers Job (folclore and fact), 2) What leaders  really do, 3)managers and leaders (are they different), 4) The discipline  of building Character, 5) the ways CEO's lead (5 different ways gathered  from study of 160 CEO's),6)The human side of management, 7) the work of  leadership, 8) whatever happened to the take-charge manager, also contains  brief background about the contributors.  Each chapter is from a different  contributo 
 The Bookclub-in-a-Box consists of a large-format paperback guide packaged in a box (this is merely a waste of paper; all you need is the guide).  The novel is not included, nor is it advertised that it is included.  This is the first one of these guides I have purchased, and my expectations have been exceeded.  This is an incredibly in-depth and book-specific guide.  It is not a generic how-to-run-a-book-group guide.  It is rather a specific guide to analyzing this particular novel.  It provides information on the author and historical background as well as analysis and examples regarding character, setting, symbolism, narration, theme, style, etc.  I highly recommend it.  My only complaint would be the overpackaging, as the box merely contains the paperback guide, a needless paper bookmark, and post-it notes.  
 This album is so great that....no words can explain it. You must by without thinking twice. You see it for sale BUY IT! 
 Dismiss everything you think you know about Hollywood and its ever-increasing divorce rate and steep through the protective cover to the novel expertly woven within only without the mess. Yet don't be fooled for this isn't exactly a health book or a study of self-development. It's a self-professed novel of pure fiction and it comes fully-prepared for an ever-growing populace intent on making an impression in the illustrious, superficial, sexy world of Hollywood. Enter to find a plethera of possibilities and directions for this novel to venture in. As everyone knows there comes a period in every girl's life when they'll be in dire need of protection against their body's natural monthly blood flow. Never fear Gigi is here to help as it's finally her time to inject a much needed sense of calm into a hyper-sensative section of the world with her very own bubbly sensability. All bubbles are set to burst as 'The Starter Wife' explodes on to the Hollywood divorce scene.  Three months before this novel was released, and without the benefit of a plot, I thought up my own direction I thought this novel might take. 'A Starter Wife' I thought could be like 'A Stepford Wife' only better and the two are thankfully no relation at all to each other. 'The Starter Wife' has a purpose. It will keep you feeling warm and toasty for not only is the writing bright and bubbly, Gigi wisely permeates a relaxed air, that usually come when reading all Hollywood hype, being you never know what to believe, that encourages it's characters to soak up the sun and surf after lead charcter Gracie Pollock is given a wake up call from her husband Kenny who pronounces over cell phone that he wants a divorce. Forcing Gracie suddenly out of her state of grace with whining alarms constantly sounding in her head, charifing one thing Kenny couldn't do in their ten year marriage with one daughter Jayden. That being successfully work a security system to a million-dollar mansion. Thank God Gracie will be through with that headache, because she couldn't work it either. Her life will be okay she thinks because this new found freedom from Kenny, will give her time to constantly revise and refine her lifestyle, like she does on a regular basis to her successful children's books. One thing's for certain she has to find her knight in shining armour before it's too late because without Kenny, Gracie knows her Hollywood ties will be cut and she can't have that, unless she gets help of some kind. In a place like Hollywood it wouldn't be wise to have enemies, but someone like Kenny's new girlfriend or her make-believe new man could snag her plans for a happy future and leave her helpless. While another powerful boss she's known for years has his sights set on her as well, and a hair-brained fantasy she doesn't know about for a funeral, and he can't wait to fulfil it...  Just like one's own individual fingerprints, that would help crack any baffling mystery, Gigi Levangie Grazer taps out 'The Starter Wife' her third book in a neat selection of stand-alone original novels. With her own unique set of rules to writing, and profound insight into the subject matter, she is my only choice to write a book like this. She is far from clueless when it comes to Hollywood couples and what makes them tick. When it comes to writing novels Gigi will always be the one I go to because she is not only a master storyteller, but she holds the all important master key. I would never want to be without it. Gigi urges her readers and newcomers to her books to take their thumb and forefinger and experience the ebbs and flows of a novel that would be hindered if it wasn't for Gigi's limitless imagination. Gigi will always make an indelible impression on the written word to me. I hope 'The Starter Wife' finds a good home.  
 This version of Jane Eyre was a PBS production back in the 80's and has a slight feeling of being 'dated".  It is very quiet with no background music at all and this actually adds beautifully to the atmosphere.  The acting is outstanding, but the character of Edward Rodchester is a little over the top in his grumpy and nasty disposition.  I really wondered how Jane could fall for him at all because he was even nasty to little Adelle.  Overall, if you are an "EyreHead"--this is a must see production.  The actress playing Jane fits well into the "plain" catagory, but has a certan fiesty quality that is well realized. The production falls very close to the books dialogue and follows C. Bronte's story more closely than most.  It is long, being 6 episodes, but well worth an afternoon of visiting Bronte country and peeking into the world of this Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece.  She would have really liked this one.  
 Admittedly, this show isn't for everyone. It can be silly sometimes. Still, it has the potential to be very funny, clever, and sweet 
 The book is very helpful.  While it is limited to the "Top 100", it covers a lot of things useful to Mac users. 
 I like this book a lot in that it really does explain the reasons behind weight gain and weight loss. A lot of the meta-stat raising suggestions make sense. I am the type that likes to know the why behind the exercise and diet. You will like it too if you are curious about the physiology of metabolism 
 In my opinion this is one of the few worthwhile gambling related books out there.  Max does a great job clearly explaining how the anyone with a $500-$50,000 bankroll can get their full gambling value.  My wife and I had spent the last couple years playing positive expectation video poker and obtaining comps the "Frugal" way.  We always came home with a seriously depleated bankroll and free rooms, but rarely did we ever do anything better than a free or discounted buffet.  However, I can now take $3000 to most any casino market, play Blackjack and break even for the most part, while eating at the best joints in the casino, free rooms, free spa admission, airfair discounts, etc.  The trick is to make them think that $3,000 is $30,000 and this book shows you how.  
 Dreams of a final theory   I believe this book's main propose was the Author, a Nobel prize winning physicist attempting to weigh in for Congressional funding of the Superconducting Super- Collider  (SSC).  This book is like reading two books in one.  The first part of the book had some very good writing about atomic particle research and excellent explanations of the experiments.  It also contains the author's surprisingly optimistic view that the theories being currently developed are the beginning of the correct path that will lead science to the "final theory".  The remainder of the book is a promotion of the field of particle physics to show that by reduction all the sciences can benefit and share in what is learned in particle physics. Chemistry, Biology, etc at their lowest levels operate at an atomic level.  Also some philosophical musings.  The author has a knack for explaining complicated ideas for the layman.   
 This book came to me in a odd way. It was mentioned in the movie "A love song for Bobby Long". Never thought it was a real book. But googling for the title (just out of curiosity) I found it. Got very curious after having read a couple of reviews and bought it. It cost me a sleepless night. I couldn't put it down and read it in one breath. It has such an impact that it leaves one breathless. What an astounding story it is. It boggles my mind how such a young woman in 1940 (she was 23 at the time the book was published) could come up with such a novel. My question is also: what has changed in the meantime, as to the social circumstances of the poor? Nothing whatsoever. It's frustrating that I cannot come up with anything original to add in this review, as far too many 5 star reviewers have already done that. It comes down to  a repitition of words like: astounding, remarkable, extraordinary, impressive, beautiful and bittersweet: ALL TRUE.  People who are looking for a plot, are looking for easy reading and have a totally dream-like idea of how life can be. Wake up people and experience truth. Take up the book again after a couple of years, and see if it will make sense by then. If you read this book, you will be totally shaken by this story of beauty and darkness.  Carson Mccullers is a genius to have written this story at such a young age. 
 This book has helped my 15 month old who has not eaten any food with the help of a SLP, G.I specialist and O.T.  The book gives clear directions and started my child eating some solids for the first time 
 This movie is a Matthew Brady photo come to life.  While it is true that the leads, Audie Murphy and Bill Mauldin, were not professional actors, they were cast for their wonderful faces and the fact that they had actually been through a recent war.  Considering what Murphy had been through, his innocence and boyishness is a joy to behold.  And they are surrounded by pros such as Andy Devine, Bill Easton and Royal Dano - as well as the usual Huston cronies.  It has many moving vignettes - the captured Rebs being questioned by their Yankee peers, Andy Devine, as the jolly soldier, leading Murphy back to his unit, the General falling to prayer before battle, Murphy confessing his cowardice to Mauldin, the General promising to have supper with the men, etc...  The narration was added later because the studio had no confidence in Murphy being able to convey the story. This was years before Hollywood understood how effective non-professionals could be if directed properly.  The studio also hated the General's high-pitched voice and so dubbed in a different actor and, of course, the complete butchering of whole scenes which reduced the movie to about 55 minutes.  With all its faults, this is one of Huston's true beauties 
 Excellent companion to Daniel B. Clendenin's other book about Orthodoxy - "Eastern Orthodox Christianity: A Western Perspective."  This book in comparison to its companion, is a compilation of contemporary Orthodox theologians' writings on such topics as: * liturgy and sacraments, * tradition, * the mystical encounter between person and God, and * relations with the other branches of the church.  One will be pleasantly surprised to read biographical information on theologians such as Kallistos Ware, Vladimir Lossky, Alexander Schmemann and others and also read their thoughts on Orthodox living theology.  This book is written for all Christians, but primarily for Protestants and Eastern Orthodox believers.  Enjoy 
 This is an excellent guide for stretching.  Good illustrations and easy to follow.  As a yoga instructor I recommend it 
 One of the best popular history works on the American Revolution.  Fischer builds up the atmosphere of Middlesex County in 1775 perfectly, and while his thesis is that Revere held a much more important role in the coming of the Revolution than a "midnight rider" he supports it with meticulous notes and information.  Fischer also gives the reader a great interpretation of what the British went through; mostly green troops stationed in a very hostile countryside.    The maps included in the book are some of the best representation of that era; I actually spent al lot of time comparing the maps of Boston and the area with the same of Google Maps as I was visiting the area; it was great to walk throughout the area in the same footsteps that Fischer described in detail.   Throughout the book his writing style at time flows like a novel, but backed with annotations and notes.  This is simply one of the best books written of this time period, and even people who have a passing interest of Revolutionary history should read it, and enjoy immensely 
 Defense argued, "Law does not exist in the Confederate prison.  Therefore, the Raiders are not guilty of breaking any law", "these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive", "only rebel law applies in the prison".   Outcries from other Union soldiers were heard, "we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics.  What about us?"  Prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men: 1. protection against murder 2. protection against theft.    The military jury found the six Raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging.  The union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized.  Mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft;  however, once intolerance levels are hit,  a violent revolution transpires.  The raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial.  However, the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the Raiders.   The "Great Escape" with McQueen probably took its plot from Andersonville.  The story line had a ton of similarities.    Andersonville has a fair share of violence.   At one point the directors portrays the prisoners as Zoombies, in the land, of the walking dead.   Scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness, in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy, abhorrence of the injustices, and despair of the troops.  Heroism abounds, leaders reject traitorous offers to defect, form their regiment, about face, and march away from on looking Confederate Admiral making offer.  Factually, 45,000 men were imprisoned and about 13,000 died from starvation, disease, and crime.  Inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water, over crowding of the prisoners, no prisoner exchange, and looting.  Andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value, as a civil war movie.  The characters were passionate, compelling, and captivating. 
 Awesome book, it reflect every Vietnamese American experience, there was alot of emotion going through me as I read this book.  I finish it in less than a week, I could'nt put it down 
 Let me make this clear: I AM A HUGE BEA FAN! This cd has many wonderful moments. "the Soup Ladle" is cute, and many of the songs have an inspired dramatic flair.  However, I feel that she could've spent more than five seconds talking about "the golden girls" and "maude" - Those of you seeking some behind the scenes dishing of "life on the set" of these classic shows will be disappointed. Some will say "Well, she was there to perform and sing!" BUT if that's true then why the Hell did she go on for so long about her "Lamb Recipe"?  I love Bea, and she sounds great vocally, but this cd just falls a little short considering the source 
 If you are a woman looking for a thoughtful review of our modern birthing culture this is a wonderful book.  I have read a lot about birth options, perspectives of the birth experience, and midwifery history and philosophy but went away wanting for more.  My desire to really explore an informed text about our birthing culture was finally satiated by this book.  I am not an anthropologist by training and yet found the book accessible, educational, and challenging.  I really suggest this book be read by everyone interested in the birth experience, partners, attendants, birthing woman, or children of technocracy 
 I purchased these cards with the thought of sending them to "special people" on my card list.  Well darn, they are so beautiful that I find myself keeping more than I thought I would for holiday decorations around my house.  I placed the "V" card, a most beautiful blue and white little gem,  underneath a mini tableside tree. "P" for poinsetta is placed in the guest bath on a shelf. So,it seems, some of my "special people" are now receiving "back up cards"..However,  for those who visit, they will find little gems tucked in special corners through out the house.  Those lucky enough to recieve a card are  getting a special gift. The paper is high quality. The white cutouts against fields of complimentary colors can be soft and quiet or joyful and ringing. The only negative is that space to pen a note or sign is not going to happen on the inside of the card.  First, you'd ruin the beautiful inside and second, these are small cards, 3.5"x 5" - I signed on the back and wrote brief notes (a respite from all the newsey family letters we all receive).  I suggest, that those who want to save them for annual decorations, they be wrapped in acid free tissue paper available at most art stores. 
 For those who expect true 5.1 Dolby Surround out of the Bose 3-2-1 system, please look elsewhere. This unit does well in projecting sound when you have the speakers at a good ear level height for your sitting area. You need to get the setting just right for it to work anywhere close to as advertised.  I bought this system probably a month or two after it came out, maybe 4 or 5 years ago and it's still going strong. I owned an apartment and wasn't to keen on marring the walls with multiple speakers for a 5.1 system or running a plethora of cable around the living room and mounting every speaker on a stand, so this system fit the bill quite nicely. Did I know I wasn't really going to get a spectacular surround sound experience? Of course I did.  The big drawback to this system is really the lack of Component Video. I only wish it had Component Video but it was put out too early and then of course the second version came out and it had component and there I was kicking myself... and still kicking myself.  For those who complain that it doesn't play all videos, I will say this. I have also had issues with it not playing videos. What I discovered was that it wasn't the DVD's but the transfers or the video type. VCD has issues, SVCD mostly plays and of course every commercial DVD I have used has always played unless there was something wrong with the DVD itself, like it was scrached or had too many fingerprints and such on its surface. Bottom line is that when I keep my DVD's clean, my Bose system is friendly.   If you've got bootleg DVD's, don't expect them to play in your Bose DVD, they probably won't work. More to the point, they probably shouldn't work becuase you shouldn't buy bootlegs anyway 
 This book is for all ages.  It is a great book to read to your grandchildren, but even if you don't have children, it has such a great message for everyone.  
 This is an good little book.  Many poses are featured in full color photographs.  One of the nice things about this book is that they show the pose, step by step.  This gives you a clear idea of how to 'get into the pose' as well as the full expression.  A few unusual poses are featured that I have not seen in standard yoga books.  I like the handy size - I can toss this right in my bag and take it anywhere.  Two complaints - the book is not the sturdiest as the binding cracks easily.  Secondly, there is not much in the way of modifications.  If you are unable to do some of the poses due to physical limitations, you won't find much here in the way to assist you.    Other than that, it is a pretty good book 
 This book gives you every conceivable example you would ever need to deal with managing on-line storage. It's obvious the author has had a lot of experience working out volume management issues with Windows servers 
 I saw the film at a young age.  Never forgot it then Oops I wanted to read the book, books are always different than the movie 
 This book is essential in the practice of Healing Tao meditations. In fact its the first book you need to study and practice before moving on to the other techniques. This is the base...everything else you build on this foundation. I got to easily understand the inner smile meditations easily from this book...but i am aware that there is another book by Master Chia which concentrates on just this and also the Healing sounds...i think its Transforming Stress into Vitality book. You can include this book too to work on your foundation. Hope this helps and have fun in the journey on the quest for balance 
 Presence of Mind will lead teachers to a more profound understanding of the omnipresent unpleasant facets of public schooling that exist around the politics of multiculturalism.  Hopefully, Leistyna's theoretical insights and experiences in this powerful work will inspire new practices that can make equity in education a true reality 
 She gives us thru this particular masterpice a good idea how the clasic music has to be play 
      Dougal Dixon's first book, After Man, was an excellent look at what animals might be like if humans became extinct. This book explores what dinosaurs might have been like if they hadn't gone extinct. It's a very interesting idea, and this book does a good job of it. Many of the dinosaurs are imaginatively designed, but are still remeniscent of real dinosaurs. However, the book is flawed in the fact that some of the dinosaurs are very improbable, for example, many have fur. These creatures are not as imaginative as those in After Man, which is one of my favorite science books. A website called The Speculative Dinosaur Project does a similar thing, except that the creatures are more plausible and more developed, and it is more thourough,          Still, this is an excellent book with a well thought out concept, and in spite of what I have said, many of the creatures are very interesting 
    Like his other series The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, these books seem to be of the "light mystery" variety with intriguing and believable characters.  Isabel Dalhousie, the heroine of the series, is a fallible protagonist--a refreshing change from so many heroines.  McCall Smith successfully narrates a woman's perspective by treating it more as a generalized "human" perspective.   	While the story follows a mystery surrounding a heart-transplant recipient, it explores more universal themes such as the pursuit of love and the assumptions we make about each other, as well as the bonds of friendship. The book is sweet without being saccharine. A worthy read 
 I suppose there are two potential audiences for an introductory database book. The first audience consists of developers who need to know the very basics about databases to design and  implement a database computer application. For that group I would recommend Date's book, but only upon having sufficient "computer science maturity": i.e. having taken one year of programming, and possibly a course in discrete mathematics and/or data structures and algorithms. Without this maturity much of what Date writes will be very hard to appreciate if not comprehend. True, he gives numerous examples that are quite understandable, but he also spends many paragraphs discussing somewhat abstract issues to the novice that will make him or her want to skip ahead. A good example of this is the notion of thinking of a table as the current value of a relvar, or the importance of closure in the relational algebra. The paragraphs he spends on these subtle importances will frustrate the uninitiated reader.   For someone who does not believe that he or she has the maturity to handle this book, and simply wants to develop an application that requires a database, I would recommend buying a more "down-to-earth" book possibly covering the RDMS that will be used. For example, if it is MySQL, then one might want to purchase  Welling's "MySQL Tutorial" (ISBN: 0672325845) for a much gentler and user-friendly introduction (or better yet the PHP and  MySQL web development book if a web application is desired).  The other audience for this book are the professionals who are in charge of managing a database and/or using a database server for an industrial-strength application. In this case, Date's book is mandatory reading. May be not all of it, but certainly Parts I-IV. Reading these parts will give the professional the needed perspective on all the considerations required for successfully using or managing a database system.  In the world of database systems, Chris Date is one of the few authors who understands the importance of every minute detail involved with successfully using and managing databases. He proves that in this book, in a style that is not only academic but also quite useful and practical (especially his chapters on the relational algebra and calculus) 
 If you are too concerned with being P.C, you wont like this book.  It shows a pattern between the races on all sorts of dimensions. From Crime to fertility to age of first sexual intercourse. Its the same pattern - Whites in the middle, Asian and Blacks on both sides.  Even Charles Murray of "Bell Curve" fame wrote in the afterword to "The Bell Curve" that Rushton is a serious researcher and doesnt deserve the flak hes getting froom society, though whether his theory is to be considered fact is still an open issue 
 i've been a melvins fan for years and this one's still my favorite, hands down (stoner witch is a close second).  every song is truly a highlight.  how many albums can you say that about?  let's take 'boris' for example.  the guitar is down-tuned to the lowest possible note, slowed down to the lowest possible speed and played almost entirely on one string.  and there are only 2 riffs in this 7 minute-long song over drum beats that are played slightly different every verse.  unbeliveable.  then you've got tracks like 'it's shoved' and 'zodiac' - faster and a little more structured tunes with some of the most original and heavy riffs i've heard to date.  anyway, i could go on and on, but i think you get the picture.  by the way, as an ex-austin-ite, i noticed the same thing about the table covers at frank and angie's.  glad to know i wasn't only one who's that obsessed with the melvins...... 
 HIP HOP!!!! this is one of the best hip hop CD since Little Brother a must have for the true hip hp lover 
 John MacArthur is known for his straight-forward approach to the Gospel.  In Hard to Believe he is at his best in defending the hard truth of the Gospel.  That hard truth is that Jesus "did not die on the cross for us to have a nice day."    Many evangelicals today are enamored with what MacArthur terms Christianity Lite.  It's an approach that tends to put the focus on ourselves and to basically use a relationship with Jesus just to make our lives happy.  But as MacArthur points out, Jesus died on the cross to save us from eternal Hell not just to allow us to live out our dreams of a happy life on earth.    Many Christians call Jesus their Savior but not many are as willing to call Him Lord.  However, that is exactly what He is and therefore we must obey His commands.  MacArthur points out that one of those commands is to die to self.  And that if we put family or friends or even ourselves above God, then we will not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.  Harsh words, but straight truth from the mouth of Jesus.  This book will cause you to examine your relationship with the Lord.  There may be some things in it that will make you uncomfortable, however, in the end I think it will reveal the absolute necessity of living our lives in total obedience to God's Word 
 I have just returned from my sixth trip to San Francisco and used this particular guide for the last three.  The detailed pictures helped me find new treasures, the info on transportation has saved me the cost of the guide many times over.  I've used this to locate both child friendly activites and also intriguing adult adventures - different trips.  This book is very well organized, beautifully illustrated and so packed with information it will take several more trips before I exhaust all it's possibilities.   I absolutely love this series of travel guides. When you first start thinking about a travel destination buy the book from this series, use it to plan your trip, take it along to guide you along the way and then bring it home to reminisce about your adventure.  These guides are thorough, giving an overview of the history, climate etc as well as detailed information about food and lodging.  The series is NOT updated as often as some others but up-to-date info in particulars are readily available elsewhere (other guides, both purchased and local freebies, and the internet).  The pictures are a plus for locating things, detailed info about local food, transportation etc is very helpful.    The only drawbacks to this series are that the books tend to be rather heavy and the need to confirm some of the info.  
 This comes off a lot like a Japanese "Tales from the Darkside", perhaps combined with "Monsters" so if you liked those "back in the day", you'll probably find something to enjoy in this.  "The Spider Woman" is the best, as a tabloid reporter chases down an "urban legend" of a woman who changes into a spider at night.  Some good humor thrown in here too.  "Blond Kwaidan" is the throw-away of the lot, kind of not much to it although a take-off on the voluminous black hair thing that shows up in a lot of Japanese films these days.   Overall this is enjoyable but it is made for TV so don't expect oodles of gore.  
 This is the book that will answer the question of why you struggle with your golf swing and what to do about it.  Discover what kind of swing, one plane or two plane, best fits your strength, flexibility, and timing then follow the proper fundamentals 
 The dramatist - the poet - he whose quill would pulse as he wrote and fill with a blush of blue, like a bruised nail. His verses, reader, his verses open out like flowers of glass, and at their center, between the brittle petals lies a pool of indigo, translucent and as huge as doom. His voice is unmuffled - it is like a bell, clearly ringing in the night of our confusion; but the clarity is the clarity of imponderable depth - depth - so that his lines float on for evermore, reader - on and on and on, for evermore. That is Shakespeare...Shakespeare 
 good stuff. does what its supposed to. a lot of sweat produced when treadmilling with it. 
 This is one of the better books on the subject of Atlantis. Its author started his research intent on supporting the screwball notion that Atlantis was in what is now Antarctica. However, he followed the evidence to where it led - the Caribbean. While his conclusions are well founded, he should also consider that what he found is only part of the answer. Recent geologic evidence demonstrates that there was an island situated at the Mid Atlantic Ridge in the North Atlantic at the end of the Pleistocene Age (circa 11,200 BP). Although there is no physical evidence that anyone lived there, it should be taken into account. Toward the end of the book, the writer goes off on a tangent about fallen angels that dampens the sound research. It could do without that but is otherwise a good read 
 Although there can only be one "Notebook", Sparks draws you into his stories that makes you want to read them again and again 
 This book is great.  I had no idea what I was doing and this book really helped me get started.  There are lots of negative reviews on here, but all of these people seemed to be experts already.  Why would a person who thinks they are an expert buy a book for dummies?  90% of what you find out there on weight training is total crap.  This book was honest and realistic - and from a trusted source 
 I don't understand how this great music remains a secret 
 This is the album that all Kenny G fans have been waiting for!!! It was well worth the wait too. Not only is Kenny G at the top of his game but the vocalists are GREAT! The entire group of artists is so eclectic. Thank you Kenny G!! 
 I couldn't put this book down, it was so enchanting and beautifully! I loved this book!!! It was just fantastic!!!! Awesome read! Anyone who loves Romance will simply fall in love with this book 
 I've heard 10 Years live about 3 weeks ago. What a privilege and what an awesome experience. Before that, I had never heard of this band. Thank goodness, I bought "The Autumn Effect" during the concert, because it is my all time fav CD now. I listen to it on a daily basis and I like EVERY single song on that album, which doesn't happen often.   10 Years unique sound speaks to my soul. You can't compare it with any other band out there. It rocks extremely and yet it has tender undertones. 10 Years - you made a new fan for life! 
 Hopefully we'll hear a lot in the future of Alexandre Desplat, because he's a very nice new colour in the realm of film music. His score for the Queen is majestic, sophisticated and haunting, beautiful, moving and elevating. It deserves all appreciation and is well worth listening to on and on again. Bravo maestro, I highly recommend it to all 
 As a practicing book artist, and a teacher of many book arts classes, I have tested many books about making books. This is one of the best I have seen. Gabrielle Fox's Essential Guide is full of innovative and stimulating book structures, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow, with excellent diagrams and full-color photographs of the steps as well completed examples. The book structures she guides us through are simple enough for beginners, yet, as her examples show, are also sophisticated enough to be used by seasoned veterans of book arts. Highly recommended 
 I first heard of Adam on ABC's Primetime special several weeks ago. The show took an inside look at his energy healing seminars.  Here people with illness come by the thousands and from miles in hopes to be freed from their disease.  Why Adam? He's able to "see" a holographic image of a person's illness and break up the negative "clumps" of energy.  This begins the circulation of healthy energy and often heals the body of its symptoms as a result.  Of course ABC made Adam look a bit like a kook; a deranged young person passing himself off as a healer then opening his pockets and lining them with ill people's money.  Hey, that's the media (don't even get me started).  therefore, before you  prejudge, I offer this disclaimer:  This is your life and health, you've got to take the time to educate yourself and form your own conclusions.  Too, if you've ever heard of Edgar Cayce or know of his healing work (if not, do check out The Story of Edgar Cayce, There Is A River, By Thomas Surgue) you will recognize Adam's gift is real, but you have to do your part.  In his book then, Adam fills in his readers in on many of the scientific grey areas paramount to keeping the body well (these ideas are what the science professors at my university called "black box" ideas - yep, those be the one's science can't quite explain).  Here Adam spells them out for you; both the ways of universal energy, where it comes from and what this means to you and your health.  Of special import, Adam explains how we are all connected to the universal energy field and how any and all information one could ever need is available to you from this field.  He also shows you how to get to it - DreamHealer is the most comprehensive description of energy as it applies to the body that I've ever read.  If you invest the time and open you mind, you will learn how you can heal yourself and/or stay well by using your thoughts to meet your intention and desired outcome.  It's true.  And everyone worth their salt says so (think Louise L. Hay, Dr. Bernie Siegel, Dr. Andrew Weil, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, Dr. Deepak Chopra, and so on). Yet, when there's so much information out there with regard to living well and curing the body of disease (take it from someone who's shelves are double parked) in my opinion - Adam deserves a read.  Even if you're a skeptic, he talks to you in terms you can understand.  After all, you are in charge of your own body which brings me to the best news - if you are already sick, Adam's ideas may just be the missing piece to your wellness you've been looking for... If only you will open your mind to the possibilities. 
 I like this cd. It's fast and heavy. Very well done album. I only have one little thing. Her vocals just don't meet up with the tempo of the songs very well. But still a good album 
 William Stirrat, AKA Hy Zaret (pen name), who wrote the words to "Unchained Melody", never liked Bobby Hatfield's (Rightous Brothers) version of it becaused he "jazzed it up".  So, I think he would have loved the way Barry Manilow sang it on this CD.  By the way, for those of you, like me, who always wondered where "Unchained Melody" got its name, it was featured in the now obscure 1955 prison movie "Unchained".  It was nominated for Best Song but lost out to another song on this CD "Love Is A Many Splendored Thing".  History aside, I like the way Barry Manilow presents these timeless classics.  You can tell he is singing them with the feeling and respect they deserve.  It's much more than "easy listening". It's a time capsule back to the '50's 
 As a trial lawyer, my success depends on the quality of my thinking. Judge McCoy has tried lots of cases, and done lots of thinking. His engaging book enriched my thinking, and thus adds to my litigation arsenal. I am a Winston Churchill enthusiast, and I especially enjoyed the book's fresh insights into how Churchill, and many other great thinkers from Albert Einstein to Mahatma Gandhi, achieved the extraordinary successes we now admire. This book will help all its readers emerge as better thinkers in many ways -- clearer, more accurate perceptions of people and their motives; more focused concentration under pressure; a deeper appreciation of intuition and its vital contribution to sound thinking, to name a few. The insights on intuition were particularly inspiring. I enthusiastically recommend "Why Didn't I Think of That?" to people in all walks of life, from professionals to managers, teachers to students, homebuilders to homemakers, lawyers to, yes, even judges -- everyone who realizes the indispensability of top-quality thinking for achieving real success in today's highly competitive, fast-changing world 
 I was stunned by how much hair this thing took off!  I have 2 Welsh Corgi's and most brushes just run over their surface hair but the Furminator brought out all the fine underneath hair...  I just love it and have told all my dog loving friends about it.  My Aunt bought one and then ordered another for my cousin 
 This book is amazing. With the stunning photography of Jeremy Cowart and beautiful reflections by Jena Lee, this book hits the heart. It's one thing to read about Africa, but it's another to be there - and this book takes you there. Don't hesitate; buy this book! You won't regret it. But do more than read it - share it with your friends and family, and give your time, effort, money, and prayers to our brothers and sisters in Africa 
 Tales from the crypt as you might know is the popular horror series that was on HBO during the early ninties so this film is the first movie to be made from that series. The film is absolutley fantastic and has alot of gore, nudity and humor in it unfortunately the sequal that was released after this was terrible and wasn't even worth it anyway the film starts of with a small segment where the cryptkeeper is directing a horror film then tells his usual stuff like some lame jokes then the real film starts with a car chase and offcourse Billy Zane as the collector was fantastic in his role he was hillarious and scary at the same time, William Sadler plays Brayker who is a drifter that stumbles upon a motel and its inhabitants and is trying to hide from the collector who happens to want a medalion that Brayker has, the collecter also summons up some demons from hell in a very cool scene so he could create alot of havoc, the film was also an homage to older horror films like the evil dead and night of the living dead as you'll see later when the characters are all stuck in this motel surrounded by demons. All the characters were great in this film and you also get a bit of background with each one of them which is rare especialy in a gory horror film like this. The film also stars Jada Pinket Smith, CCH Pounder who gets her arm ripped off in this film and Thomas Haden Church who plays the obnoxious jerk and some other actors that I don't recognise all this makes for a great and enjoyable horror film that I highly recomend that you watch 
 This is a beautifully written book to read to your young child.  It is so full of imagination that you are taken into Dahl's magical world believing that a giraffe, a pelican, and a monkey could do your next window cleaning.  We read "James and the Giant Peach" last year, and like that book this one is great read aloud.  The action of the book keeps your child on the tips of their toes.  It is such fun 
 Ever since I first dined at Rover's, 12 years ago, it has been my favorite restaurant, and the yardstick by which I measure all other restaurants.  The food, the presentation, the imagination, the service, the ambiance, the wine, and the personalities all combine for an experience that, time after time, reaches perfection.  With that in mind, I have been eagerly awaiting the publication of this book to find out how the Chef in the Hat does it, and how I can try to duplicate it at home.    Thierry and Cynthia have been able to capture the essence of Rover's in this beautiful book, with a list of recipes that is both intriguing and enticing, without creating a "This was done by a trained professional, and should not be attempted at home," coffee table book (as so often is the case from well known chefs).  There are amazing recipes here that can be prepared in a home kitchen, with outstanding results.  The reason for this is that Thierry has suggestions about de-intimidating the recipes.  He gives you suggestions for options from the full blown recipe to less demanding preparations, with more common ingredients.  He acknowledges that the home chef does not have an army of minions and an unlimited pantry saying, "I'd rather have you cook the recipe and enjoy it without garnish, rather than have you panic about shrimp roe and chervil sprigs!"  But, oh, what wonderful results!  The book is also a pleasure to read, as Thierry's charisma, humor and touching recollections about home and family add considerable warmth and charm, much like his visits to the tables do at Rover's.    This book will sit on my shelf, alongside books from Charlie Trotter's, the French Laundry, and Jean-Louis.  The difference is that within a few months it will not look new, like the others do.  Instead, I expect that it will look like my copy of Julia Child's, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, with a broken spine and loose and spattered pages, from frequent use.  
 Dr. Hoeller works carefully with this work by Martin Heidegger. The result is a thorough but readable writing of Heidegger as he attempts to ground the poetry of this german poet. Even a cursory reading shows Heidegger as constantly plowing the ground of the basis of poetry and not "merely" poeticizing. For those who, somehow, find, incorrectly, that Heidegger has simply fallen from philosophy to poetry this translation can open up Heideggers' project as being other than "merely poeticizing". Heidegger is fully aware of the value of poets and the "word" they speak but he is also aware that the "ground" from which poets spring wants to be brought to the "unconcealed" in a manner that both respects the "poets' calling" and at the same time lays bare the "thought" of the poet and his poetry. This translation is a welcome addition to the growing literature about perhaps the most significant philosopher in recent times 
 Philosopher, rock critic and fretboard master Chad Winn hits paydirt with this recommendation showcasing the acoustic and electric prowess of singer/songwriter Chris Whitley. One moment soulful and ethereal, the next moment driving and pulsing, this ecclectic compilation delivers the goods with 16 thoughtfully selected tunes covering the past decade 
 Anyone who has been to Santo Domingo and Florida should read this book and watch the movie 
 Dr Alex Shigo almost singlehandedly revolutionized the tree-care industry by researching how trees work, and how they deal with injuries (including pruning) and decay. This book uses color photos and clear explanations of how pruning should be done for the most benefit to a tree itself and to the people who share its space, for maximum beauty, safety and serviceability.  I used to have a copy of this book, but evidently somebody liked it even better than I did.  The copy I'm buying will be my second, and I don't plan to lend it out 
 I just finished reading Ginsberg's complete poems, 1947-1997 -- Collected Poems, White Shroud, Cosmopolitan Greetings, and Death and Fame -- fifty years and over a thousand pages of poetry. My overall impression is that he was probably the kindest, most moral member of the beat generation. When the other beats were penniless & borrowing money, Ginsberg was the one they borrowed money from. Corso would steal Ginsberg's manuscripts and sell them to used book dealers to score heroin, and each time Ginsberg would walk down to the book dealer and buy back his priceless words. Where Kerouac preached his own version of buddhism and gave it up a few years later for catholic alcoholism, Ginsberg remained a dedicated student of buddhist compassion to the end of his days.  And that's what shines thru in many of these poems -- compassion, attention to the present, and the courage to be so honest about his life and his feelings. Many of these poems are raw, experimental, informal, and spontaneous, almost like journal entries. This book contains numerous classics -- Pull My Daisy (written with Kerouac & Cassady in 1949), Howl, America, Kaddish, Mescaline, Lysergic Acid, Wichita Vortex Sutra, Wales Visitation, Elegy for Neal Cassady, Memory Gardens (elegy for Jack Kerouac), and Ode to Failure, among others.   Some of the most common themes are world travel, nature, daily events, progressive politics, the US invasion of Vietnam, the peace movement, road trips, drug use, the beats, gay sex, hinduism, buddhism, death, and love. In other words, Ginsberg wrote about his life. He talks about his friends dying, his father dying, his mother's insanity and death, his loves, his joys, and whatever is pressing and interesting to him at the moment. Some of the poems are better than others, but I can't imagine there's a more honest poet out there.  Casual readers of the beats will likely want to skip around and read a poem here, a poem there, just checking out the highlights. But even for casual readers, there's no sense in buying Ginsberg's small City Lights books -- just buy this big red book so you can have it all. And don't stop here. Ginsberg's later books -- White Shroud, Cosmopolitan Greetings, and Death and Fame -- prove that Ginsy just got better with age, confronting man's inevitable decline into disease and death 
 I was surprised how good this book was. There were a few errors with the book (I counted 4), but most of them were typos. The book provides a good history and background about the Supreme Court, the Chief Justices, and then some notable Justices. After that, the author shows how the Supreme Court affects peoples' lives by examining a variety of court cases. Reading some of the opinions will put you to sleep. I have no problem recommending this book 
 	Mrs. Boynton sorrowfully reached her "appointment with death" sooner than usual in Agatha Christie's enthralling book.  The twisting plot and realistic characters keep you on the edge of your seat as you wade deeper into the unpredictable story.  Agatha Christie's magic has once again weaved its way into one of her finest stories, Appointment with Death.  Everyone is on their feet cheering the Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot, as he uses his "little gray cells" in order to determine not who would kill Mrs. Boynton, but who would not kill this old, cruel witch. 	The characters, although not my favorite part of this book, were unlike any I have ever read about before.  Mrs. Boynton a cruel, power-hungry, old woman is hated by everyone in this enriching plot.  She is a failure with a thirst for power that is fed by bossing around her family.  Everyone has a reasonable motive for killing Mrs. Boynton, especially her "devoted" yet unhappy family.  Hercules Poirot is the other main character in this book. He is possibly the most important.  He is a Belgian detective who is extremely proud of two things, his mustache and his "little gray cells."  He sets out to examine the suspicious circumstances and bring the clever murderer into the spotlight. 	Murderers on the run with a brilliant Belgian detective hot on the trail... plots don't get much more exciting than that.  This is the exciting plot expressed in Agatha Christie's Appointment with Death.  The captivity faced by Mrs. Boynton's family, and the prospect of one of the family being the horrible murderer is almost too much to bear.  One of the great things about the plot is that the emotion displayed pulls you into the story.  This plot was so unexpected and complex that I was kept guessing as to the murderer's identity until the very end.  The only way to truly express the feeling put into the plot is to say that Agatha Christie's light shines again. 	The only thing in this book that thoroughly disappointed me was the setting.  It did not take away from the rest of the book, however, it did not add "wow" factor to the story.  I felt like it was a normal everyday setting and that is not what I was looking for in Agatha Christie's book.  The setting helped make the whole story more believable, but most mystery lovers are not looking for a realistic, believable book. Instead they are looking for an exciting thrilling book.  I felt that Agatha Christie did not live up to her name with this setting.   	Appointment with Death was, overall, a thrilling mystery book.  I was thoroughly delighted with Agatha Christie's effort and felt that her feelings showed throughout it.  The plot and characters added a breathtaking "wow" factor that kept me up all night reading this book.  The setting, although not bad, did not contribute anything unique to the book.  Overall, it was a great book for mystery readers of all ages.  Agatha Christie has done it again, creating one of the world's finest mystery stories. 
  I really recommend this book to everyone in search for physical, mental, spiritual and financial freedom 
 In Barrier Of A Common Language: An American Looks At Contemporary British Poetry, Dana Gioia (poet, literary critic, and Chairman of the National Endowment for the Art) has assembled insightful and informative essays on British poets and poetry over the past two decades. A scholarly compilation of such varied topics as the growing disconnect between British and American poetry; fading traditions in poetic literature; and in-depth analysis of modern works, fill the pages of this astute and superbly presented anthology of criticism. Barrier Of A Common Language is a welcome and seminal contribution to academic library British Literature & Poetry reference collections and reading lists 
 This was one of my favorite books as a child!  I read this many times in the attic of our summer home, looking out the window at our apple tree.  I was recounting the story to my children the other day and we stopped in at Borders and I ordered the book.  I'm so glad it's still in print.  It's truly a great family-oriented read-aloud story - perfect for the younger set! My emergent-reader 1st Grader was able to read this with me 
 Rosemarie Garland Thomson has written a book that is groundbreaking and essential reading for anyone interested in the fields of disability theory, disability studies, and literary criticism.  She has skillfully examined  how the figure of the disabled body has been used in literature in  different periods as a marker or boundary line for defining what the  "normal" body is or should be.  The disabled figure operates to  displace anxiety from more "normal" folks, and in the process  shows how what we consider to be normal functioning changes across  historical periods and cultures.  Thomson also compares the disabled figure  to the cyborg, as both are figures that are not seen as  "natural," and both are places/signifiers where we can then  interrogate what the natural is, has been thought to be, and what it could  include.  This is an excellent book, and should not be missed

 Anyone with an interest in business history has to be fascinated by the story of Wal-Mart. Starting from a single store in an obscure Southern town, the company expanded relentlessly over the course of thirty-five years to become the most powerful retailer in the world. At the center of this story stands the enigmatic figure of Sam Walton, a folksy and sincerely genial man who ran the single store back in the mid -1950's and still controlled the burgeoning corporate empire at the time of his death in 1992, having by then amassed the largest personal fortune in America.  Bob Ortega has done a workman-like job in telling the story of both the company and its founder. However, Ortega is an investigative journalist by trade, not a biographer or business historian. His interest in Wal-Mart began with a series of muckraking reports he did on the company during the 1990's, and he devotes the last half of "In Sam We Trust" to rambling through much of this material, focusing on Wal-Mart's longstanding compliance with abusive and illegal labor practices on the part of its suppliers, and on it ruthless real-estate practices that have for the last three decades steam-rollered over what remains of the cultural ethos of small-town America. Ortega is a good writer and a conscientious journalist,  laboring hard to stick to facts and avoid sensationalism. And given his obvious distaste for what Wal-Mart has become, it speaks well of his literary integrity that the historical and biographical portions of this book are objectively told. Sam Walton himself is portrayed with his all positive personal qualities intact - he's rather likeable - and his flaws, while apparent, aren't blown out of proportion either. The fascination with him, which is well-presented, lies in the paradox of such an amiable fellow possessing  a ruthless competitive drive rivaling that of the any of the legendary 19th century Robber Barons. The problem with Ortega's book is that the biographical and historical half doesn't fit together very cohesively with the muckraking half, even though both portions are well-enough done in their own terms. Anyone wanting business history here is going to get a little bored with the repetitive accounts of third-world sweatshops and anti-Wal-Mart community action drives. I recommend the book, but many readers should be prepared skim over portions of it 
 I love this coffee maker from Krups. It's the best coffee maker I have ever had. It looks so elegant on my countertop and it produces great tasting coffee. I also like the size. 10 cups were more than enough for all my guests. I definitely recommend it 
 Very informative and enjoyable reading. I am impressed by the apparent easiness of the combination of historical, sociological, biological and evolutionary aspects 
 This book is one nobody should miss. Cortzar has an excelent way of sayin things and this book isn't the exception, but the temporal structure was wonderfuly surprising in the 50's and is still. But is not just a curious way of telling things, it also deals with the most profound theams of life, love, pasion, relationships and how to understand the world. It is profoundly human, and the ultimate question that rises once you read it is Where do you really find humaness 
   As a Floyd fan and a musician, I found this book incredibly interesting. Mason does an perfect job in describing Floyd from it's embryonic state to it's final performance, to it's unlikely Live 8 appearance.   I loved it. I bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas. I ended up reading it from Christmas morning through the following days.    My only negative criticism was that I wish more time had been spent on the why's and how's the in fighting become so overwhelming and so difficult for these guys that they had no choice but to disband. Other than that a great book.    
 This is a pretty good quality pack for the money. It looks good and feels well built. The height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it. It uses velcro panels to hold itself in place (plus a locking strap to secure it once it's adjusted) and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down. It was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip. My only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day, which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent. Fortunately there are plenty of extra loops/pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and I was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack. So you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range. 
 Some view Dr Phil's advice as harsh and 'in your face'. However, most of the time, this is what we need to be able to face our problems squarely and deal with them.  This book is no exception. The advice is down to earth, 'in your face' and, yes, could be seen as 'harsh'.  Maybe this is just what is needed?  Topics/chapters:  - You either get it, or you don't  - You create your own experience  - People do what works  - You can't change what you don't acknowledge  - Life rewards action  - There's no reality; only perception  - Life is managed; it is not cured  - We teach people how to treat us  - There is power in forgiveness  - You have to name it to claim it  - A guided tour of your life  - The seven-step strategy  - Finding your formul 
 It's been over six years since my first reading of this book, yet lessons I learned from Boorstin still pepper my daily thinking.  His perspective of psuedo-events and the way humans travel in other countries shakes ingrained American paradigms.  I've never attended a parade, watched a televised sporting event, or bought a tourist souvenir in the same way since

 Ayi Kweh Armah is one of the most important writers for people of African descent anywhere they may be on the planet. When I first read his novel,"Two Thousand Seasons", I was awestruck. I immediately went out and bought another ten copies to give to family and friends as gifts. I consider it the best book ever written."The Healers" is no less powerful in it's message, although it is an easier read.This novel speaks to the continuing disunity of Africa as nothing else I've ever read. And in it Armah also gives us the cure. It is a must read. Armah writes with such power and beauty that it defies description.Although "Two Thousand Seasons" is my favorite book, "The Healers" has solidified Ayi Kwei Armah as my favorite author.If you happen to find any of this brilliant writers' work, snap it up quick

 In contemplating that Homo Sapiens may be at least  one million years old, and yet recorded civilization only 5000 to 6000 years old, the author William S. Burroughs referred to that wide gap of history, "a long question mark". Dr.Schoch's book, however, while absolutely  fascinating, sheds little light on the "long question mark". This  book is heavy on catastrophes and little about ancient civilizations.  Dr.Schoch starts the book by defending his theory that the Sphinx may be  twice as old as conventionally thought, then a little about the antiquity  of the Lascaux caves and an interesting bit about the possibility that the  Magdalenian culture of ancient Europe and Asia Minor culminating in Catal  Huyuk may have inspired the myths of Atlantis. All quite interesting and  worthy of more in depth analysis; but Dr.Schoch merely throws these  theories out with little information on their merits or pitfalls,(though he  does go to some lengths to defend his theories about the possible older age  of the Sphinx.) Far from being paradigm shifting, well over 75% of the book  is an apologia for orthodox scientific thinking in regard to catastrophism  and possible pre-historic civilizations. Dr.Schoch even resorts,  disappointingly, to calling theories he doesn't agree with, (Hapgood,  Velikovsky, Sitchin), as "blather"...the old tried and true  tactic of the True Faith: label the heretics as lunatics. This is paradigm  shifting? Still, the passages in the book about what happens when large  extraterrestrial bodies hit are hair-raising and well worth the price of  the book. But paradigm shifting? Hardly.. 
 I agree with the review above mine. Judith hits everything right on the money! It is so accurate I won't let my male friend read it yet, because I feel it will disclose parts of my personality I don't want him to know yet.  I too would like Judith to write a book like this about men, or at least  find a comparable one. This book hits on EVERY aspect of women you could  imagine 
 Having just recently 'graduated' from making scarves and just about anything else square or rectangular that didn't require patterns or gauge concerns, i was feeling a bit intimidated and confused over some knitting basics. i have a generous assortment of knitting books, and some are more helpful than others. this is one of the best ones.  i find these instructions to be extremely friendly and clearly expressed. the pictures are clear and accurate. and finally a book that shows and describes that mysterious process of weaving in ends!! this book covers all the basics - yarn fibers, yarn labels, gauge, color chart, needles, etc. and includes a cute and fun 'quiz' which i got a kick out of.  there are great tips throughout the book, colorful photos of the patterns, cute drawings, a nice section on felting (fulling), and even a wonderful recipe for homemade hand salve!  the patterns are defined well by the subtitle of the book "fun and funky". it could be argued that they may be most appealing to the younger crowd, but i think a beginner knitter (or a former knitter in need of a refresher course) would be pleased with the selection. who couldn't use a hat, handbag, scarf/stole, or pair of leg warmers? on top of that and several other items, there's a cool pattern for 'text messaging mittens' that feature thumb panels you can flip off. and dont forget your cat! -  you can whip up some cat toys using the adorable wonton and eggroll patterns.  this is a fun book offering very helpful instructions for your foundation in knitting. you will find the cool, beginner-friendly patterns will not only help you learn the basics, but you will also find that they become items that you will use for yourself or as gifts for friends/family/felines.   happy knitting 
 For all those who think Nu Metal is dead.....well it is.  So what did members from these kind of bands (Primer 55 and Darwin's Waiting Room) do?   They made a stand up solid hard rock record.  Great production, smart writing, and a great live act.  A good album, and a great one for a brand new act.  My ONLY guff w/ this album is the guitar work, although very good, is a pbit predicable.    Pick this one up if you like Foo Fighters, Sevendust, or The Exies.   Make Alston your weekly music purchase...you'll be glad you did 
 pastor troy is fallin off? Faceoff Pt. 2 is the hottest cd out right now, and DSGB is tiiiiiight. Pastor Troy is the hottest artist out of Atlanta, surely fallin off then doubles his money/sucess/fame but ok............ shows u how much he knows, i'd say buy buy buy, and go get Faceoff Pt.  
 I wish that more books were this interesting and sincere. This is one of the top novels I have read in the past ten years. You can really become attached to the characters and truely care about them. It is well worth your time, then rent the movie which is also very well done. However, the book as always is better 
 Joe Gaziano from Chicago, Illinois , November 24, 1998   An excellent book that explains human/animal relations Unnatural Order establishes Jim Mason as one of the important intellectuals of the Animal Rights Movement. Mason  provides a thoughtful and readable analysis of the relationship of people  to animals throughout history. In this book Mason demonstrates how the  changes in animal/people relationships have, over time, dramatically  altered human existence. In much of the early history of humanity people  lived in harmony with animals. Nature was viewed as containing fellow  creatures with many of the same characteristics as people. Animals were  revered and respeced. The move to an agricultural society where increasing  numbers of animals became food resulted in a shift of consciousness. The  culture became one in which humans were seen as dominant over and superior  to animals. Humans increasingly separated themselves from nature and the  animals, often denying their own animal nature. The result is a human  culture divorced from nature and suffering from all the ill effects that  such a society produces. Mason's book should be read by every vegetarian  and animal rights advocate. It is sure to be a classic in the field 
 This memory is litle than I thougt , but very secure and very cute 
 These are the most comfortable wedges I have ever worn. The soft lining keeps your feet dry and the wedge height is not a problem. I have worn my almost every day and my feet feel wonderfully! Highly recommended 
 Give Up transcends the labels of Electronica and Indie, sure it helps to put it in a category but you don't have to be immersed in either one of these genres to appreciate this album, simply put... it's beautiful. Of course much has been said about this album already, but something that affects you to this degree compels you to speak out with your own words. While the general sound may not be considered entirely innovative by some, the power of this dynamic duo surely lies in their delivery.   The heartfelt vocals and innocent, often childlike soundscapes, breakdown your defenses and before you know it, these songs burrow deep inside you becoming part of your life. Perhaps the reason it's so successful is that it feels genuinely honest, not sappy and over emotional, but truly and utterly "real". 
 I have looked in several book stores for a book that would give me the guidance I felt I needed to tackle directing a wedding and found nothing.  Finding "Planning and Directing a Wedding" has saved the day for me.  It has answered almost all of my questions in a clear, easy to follow, organized way.  I especially like the fact that it comes from the actual experiences of the author.  
 A great documentary (with a dark, ironic, humorous side) of American culture as shaped by the Cold War (paricularly 1950s and 1960s).  I use parts of this in a class I teach, and the students love it.  How can you go wrong with the Duck and Cover turtle song and the kid riding his bike in an oven mitt to protect against an unexpected blast? 
 Night Shift is a great collection of early horror stories from the master himself.  20 stories in total, most of them great winners.   Notable standouts include:  Quitters Inc. where a man goes to an agency to quit smoking. The first time he is got caught cheating he gets a warning. The second time he is caught smoking his wife goes missing. You will have to read to find out what happens the third time.   The Ledge:  A tennis pro has been having an affair with a woman married to a powerful and evil man. The Hero must want around a skyscraper's narrow ledge on a bet where is life is the stakes. If he wins he gets the girl and Money. If he looses he has a long drop...  I am the Doorway: an astronaut caught something evil in space. It is now part of his body and soul. Eyes from another dimension open from the palms of his hands and the hatred from their eyes rains destruction on earth. But can he stop the aliens before it is too late?   Battleground:  A box of toy soldiers that are more than just plastic. A man rapped in his apartment has to escape, but he is not the type to run away. He would rather fight than flee...  And 16 more...  Anyone who is unsure if they want to become a "King Addict" like me, unwilling to buy a full length novel may want to start with this collection, as they are short stories, but are classic King nonetheless. Be warned however, after reading this great collection, you will likely be hooked on King, and scared for remainder of your life...  Relic113 
 This book was loaned to me by a friend who swore that I would have to read it "with one hand free". While the story is very erotic, and the sex scenes are very real and compelling, I would not wholly agree with that statement. This, in part, is due to the fact that love scenes between men and women no longer do anything for me sexually. I prefer erotic writings between two women, and, though there were a few added to this book to spice things up (for me anyways) there were definitely not enough to arouse me to free one hand.   The story, however, is well written. It was an easy, delightful read, one that I polished off in two sittings. It catalogues the life of a young writer coming into her own sexuality, seizing whatever moments of transient, sensual bliss that she comes across. This book is somewhat autobiographical, cultivated from Di Prima's own experiences as a college drop out who, annoyed with the system of 1950`s education, decided to instead pursue writing full time. The main character in the story parallels her life to such a degree that the author had even named her heroine "Di Prima". The character Di Prima also flits about in the underworld of 1950's New York, inhabiting skeevy, infested pads with multiple people, coffee houses, book stores, parks, smoked out bar scenes, forests, fields, and (on one occasion) a country farm. Where the truth is obscured in this bohemian world of sex, drugs, and (pre) rock and roll is only up to the reader's decision. I know little about Di Prima myself, so I like to look at this as a fairly inventive, fictional piece of writing.   This is definitely a worthwhile read. I must admit, were I more inclined to heterosexual love scenes, I would have, indeed, read this with one hand free, seeing as how in every single chapter is a different, vivid description of one of her many sexual encounters. If you are inclined to beat writing, this is a canon of that genre. If you are a fan of erotica, how have you not read this one yet? Read it in a room, alone, or with a partner. It will get your juices flowing, if you pardon the pun. 
 DJ Quik comes back in 1995 with his third album "Safe+Sound."  This, arguably, is his best album.  He still uses his old-school p-funk samples, but refines and matures them.  His rhyming is so entertaining; he is light-hearted and funny.  His high-pitched rapping voice is tight and amplifies the entertainment value of the album.  This album is all G-Funk with a touch of jazz and rock & roll.  This album is the one he introduces his Roger-like talkbox that would be trademark of his later work.  I may not be a fan of "pimp" rhymes and constant "sex rap," as are commonplace in Quik's work, but even I am won over because he has such tight beats in those songs.  He also puts in several party jams that make the album fun to listen to.  He also has a few hard-core songs with awesome beats.  It's a shame he is so underrated 
 This movie is just plain excellent. From top to bottom. The acting, direction, soundtrack, costumes and cinematography are just tops. The story is very interesting and the characters are rich and explored wonderfully. It is well balanced and done so well that I can only say check it out. 
 American River has a sound that is so relaxing that it is almost hypnotic. It just puts you into a trance that is incredible, you can feel the instruments. My personal favorite is the track entitled 'move'. It's definantly worth the purchase. 
 Lego may be the most versatile and beautifully designed construction toy of all time. It's an ingenious blend of engineering, art and fun. Read Allan Bedford's book and you'll probably agree!  I've been a Lego fan for over 40 years, but most of the time I've just been reliving childhood memories from the mid-1960s - occasionally building houses out of red and white bricks, then putting them back into storage. Allan Bedford's book has changed all that. It has shown me what I've been missing all these years!   The creative - and yes, artistic! - potential of Lego is absolutely mind-boggling. Bedford's book explores areas most people couldn't even imagine. There's something for everyone: mosaics and sculptures for artistic types, buildings and vehicles for aspiring architects and engineers, microscale projects for those who prefer or need to keep things really small (note: it's the best way to build things at work without attracting too much attention!), and even sorting and storage tips for serious builders and collectors. And be warned: after you read this book, you won't be able to resist buying a LOT more Lego!  A special feature of Bedford's book is the Brickopedia - an appendix illustrating hundreds of Lego pieces, including the year each was introduced. It alone is worth the price of the book. It made me appreciate the truly brilliant design of the Lego elements that have appeared since the 1960s.   Once you're familiar with the newer Lego bits in the Brickopedia, you'll be delighted with the way they can be used in different Lego constructions. Just recognizing them is half the fun: the front of Santa's sleigh can show up as part of an automobile spoiler; a shark's tooth can morph into the visor of a traffic light; and a snowman's nose can be used as a fire hose nozzle.  One of Picasso's most loved and whimsical sculptures is a bull's head fashioned from a bicycle seat and a pair of handle bars (Tête de taureau,1942). It took artistic vision and a playful creativity to put these components together. Lego opens the door to the vision and creativity that reside within us. Allan Bedford's book is the long-awaited key! 
 What can i say other than read this book and see why it's one of the best books you will ever read 
 Stomping folk rock.  Fun if you like Love's first album or the early Byrds 
 Hardcore? I never considered their music hardcore. I'll make this a short one. If you like punk music, like myself, then buy this. If you like AFI, buy this album. If you think "Sing the Sorrow" is the best AFI album don't bother. I liked Sing the Sorrow, it was different. It takes alot for a band to change their sound for a CD. The songs on this are about 2 minutes each, If you are thinking too short then just remember when punk came out, nobody liked it either, because it was fast, aggressive, not quite on key all the time, and the songs were very short. Don't believe me? Just listen to some Circle Jerks, Black Flag, or the Misfits. But Whatever. 5 stars  
 The book does an excellent job of explaining portion sizes and what is a normal size meal. Will help anyone trying to drop a few pounds, or maintain her or his body weight they are at now. Good rules to follow for feeding childern-teach them at an early age what is normal proportions and they will have less problems later in life and prevent them from  " super sizing" everything in site. Highly recommended

 People may wonder why I'm reviewing this Christmas CD in February. "Oh, wow, Matt's writing a review of a Christmas CD in February?" You bet I am! We're having our first real snowstorm today after an incredibly dry winter; and it made me think of the holiday season and Christmas. This CD brought back frond memories for me of listening to great Christmas music when I was young. The CD features Louis Armstrong and his contemporaries performing classic Christmas songs with a few pleasant surprises thrown in for good measure. Awesome!  The CD opens with Louis Armstrong performing "Christmas In New Orleans" with the big band sound of The Benny Carter Orchestra in the background. The musical arrangement relies on the horns and wonderful piano playing to enhance the beauty of this joyful number. Louis plays a splendid trumpet solo as well.   After THAT intro you'll scream for more; and that's exactly what you will receive! Louis performs the traditional melancholy ballad entitled "White Christmas;" Louis Armstrong croons delightfully on this number with the incomparable Gordon Jenkins and His Orchestra. Louis and The Benny Carter Orchestra join forces a second time to produce the big band flavored "Christmas Night In Harlem." Enchanting! SMILES  In addition to "White Christmas," other traditional Christmas songs on this album include "Silent Night" performed Dinah Washington with a backup choir; a live recording of Mel Torme performing "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire);" and a jazzy big band rendition of "Jingle Bells" by Duke Ellington and His Orchestra. I guarantee this will make you happy any time of the year!  A few special surprises pop out at you, too. Louis Armstrong and The Commanders deliver "Cool Yule" with panache, sophistication and joy in their hearts. The big band arrangement and the trumpet solo leave nothing to be desired--this is perfection! In addition, Eartha Kitt sings her famous number "Santa Baby" with Henri Rene and His Orchestra. Lena Horne also does a great job with "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town." She even sings a few bars of an opening verse! Lena's voice is rich, warm and vibrant.   The CD ends with Louis Armstrong and Gordon Jenkins teaming up one more time for "Winter Wonderland." This peaceful yet joyful rendition provides a strong ending for this album.   I highly recommend this CD for Louis Armstrong fans as well as people who enjoy classic Christmas pop vocals. The big band sounds on some tracks enhance your listening pleasure. May you get this CD and enjoy it as much as I have! 
 After so many right wing wise-use books recently accusing native Americans of milking the bleeding heart liberal environmental agenda for everything it was worth by refashioning their spiritual heritage to match white middle class eco-fervor like some come hither firework road stand, this book by Ed McGaa is a breath of fresh air, making one realize that the native American love and unity with the earth is not just some greenwashing PR scam. I highly recommend this book to those of us who are involved or simply fascinated by native culture's sudden organization in regaining control of their patrimony, a luxury afforded to them by the realization that sovereignty over their lands entitles all Indian tribes to a slew of business opportunities never before possible. If the growing cash flow of reservation casinos can translate into environmental industries, which it already has at resorts like the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, this book may very well be the rallying call tribal leaders needed to make strength in numbers 
 Totally hilarious 
 This was a great purchase and highly recommended for those of us who have a long commute and no time to read a book 
 this cd is a carbon-copy of everything mineral has ever done. luckily for these guys, mineral is totally amazing. i can't really diss the band for its rip-off quality,though...because some of the members of mineral are in  it. i guess we can be happy for the gloria record...it's just like mineral  never broke up 
 When Razo is invited to join a diplomatic mission to a neighboring country, he can't understand why he's been chosen. He is an indifferent soldier, has no political importance, and feels much more comfortable in his role as animal keeper at the palace. But the war between Bayern and Tira has changed everything about his life. Razo no longer knows what to expect, even from his closest friends.  His friend Enna is most damaged from the war. She seems to have learned how to control her fire-speaking powers, which decimated the Tiran army and threatened to burn her from the inside out. But when burned bodies start turning up, threatening the hard-won peace between the countries, Razo worries that Enna might be responsible.  Razo's investigations lead him into a complicated puzzle of intrigue. Despite his lack of supernatural powers, Razo's keen powers of observation, his skill with his slingshot and his ability to make friends wherever he goes make him a formidable foe against those who long to return to war.  One of Shannon Hale's greatest strengths as a writer is her commitment to creative conflict resolution. Hale's book PRINCESS ACADEMY features a heroine who helps her village withstand an invasive culture through non-violent resistance. Not only is it a powerful study of the kinds of tools that are used to control people, it is a testament to the strength of ordinary people to resist.  RIVER SECRETS is the third book in Hale's Companions of Bayern series, which began with GOOSE GIRL, her highly original retelling of Grimm's fairy tale. RIVER SECRETS contains elements of creative conflict resolution, notably Razo's unarming charm, but ultimately the book tends more towards polarized conflict between good and evil. While never suggesting all Tirans are bad (there are many likable Tiran characters), Hale doesn't spend very much time exploring why many of the Tirans would prefer to be at war than to make peace with their neighbors. Likewise, there are no Bayern characters questioning the peace between the two countries. The final showdown features a predictable fight between Tirans and Bayerns with no surprises as to the identity or the nationality of the villain.  Hale is a fine author with a lively, world-building imagination. As a fantasy author she is only limited by what she can invent and by what readers will accept. RIVER SECRETS is not as emotionally gripping as the previous volumes in the series, but it will satisfy fans eager for the next installment. It is my hope that Hale continues to push the borders of her worlds to explore the potential available to her within the fantasy genre.     --- Reviewed by Sarah A. Woo 
 The Bad - Like all of the Portable MBA series, the book provides a limited and somewhat superficial coverage of the topic.  It will not replace a good entreprenuerial course in an excellent MBA program.  The Good - Having been involved in four failed and one successful entrepreneurial ventures in the past 15 years, I can tell you with a great deal of certainty that there are many hidden gems in the book that will save you (potentially) years of wasted efforts and large sums of money.  One example: if you are planning a business venture, and you cannot name specific companies, and specific individuals in specific companies, as part of your target market, then you have not performed due dilegence and are not ready to begin a business venture.  Vague target markets such as "the public" or "somebody and some large telecomm company" are the sure road to failure 
 This is one of the few books that I consider great. As a practicing CEO I find it refreshing when common sense thinking shows up in the academic world. If you would like to read a well researched book with a very deep  insight into the business world (both American, Canadian and European),  this is absolutely your pick. Highly recommeded, even if it is a bit wordy  from time to time 
 This is the single most important book on African poverty you are likely to read. Ok, it doesn't compare with the scope of Cliffe's The African Poor. But it is very powerfully written and extremely insightful. Those  familiar with participatory assessments will know they often find that  respondents blame the poor for their plight (not surprising, we do the same  in developed countries) - but these results are usually ignored by the  researchers. This book demonstrates how important this finding is - not  because the poor ARE to blame for their poverty, but because the stigma  attached to being poor creates a social poverty trap 
 I just got this book, and I purchased herbs and am ready to make my first set of tea pills!  Not only is this fun, it's healthy.  I am a BIG believer in alternative and more natural medicines (I am currently studying Oriental Medicine) and find this a way that everybody can help their health in a gentle and historic way.  This is how our grandmothers did things!  And I appreciate Ms Gladstar preserving these recipes for us.    In herbal and Oriental Medicine, conditions like PMS and problematic menstruation are related to the liver.  The liver and thyroid are closely linked, and many women today are experiencing problems with thyroid.  Ms. Gladstar has some lovely endocrine (the endocrine system includes the thyroid) and liver teas.  She 'knows her stuff' and gives wonderful advice on using the herbal formulas.  Excellent book!  I only gave it four stars because I don't know how accessible getting herbs will be for everyone (ordering online or living close enough to purchase them at a specialty shop) and if people will take the time to do it.  If you do, this is a five star plus book! Carri 
 My 2-year-old daughter loves this book because of the farm animals and likes pointing out the scarecrow when he appears.  It's a great book for bedtime because it's calming and toward the end it gets dark and the animals start turning in for the night.  The illustrations are beautiful and it is an enjoyable read for all.  If your child likes animals and the moon, this is a must-buy.  
 "We Are On Our Own" is a gripping memoir of a mother's struggle to survive in Hungary during WW ll.  Miram Katin recalls her early childhood in this beautifully illustrated graphic novel. It is a moving tale about the horrors of war and a mother's determination to save her child at any cost.   I've just read it, and together with Alison Bechdel's "Fun Home: a Family Tracicomic" it's the best book I've read in a long time. Buy it now 
 The elements of the universe.........EARTH..WIND..&..FIRE. By far they are the Greatest Of All Time. And, That's The Way Of The World, may be indeed their best album. They have and will always be a big part of my musical life and history. From my first introduction to them in 1974, at the age of three, to now. I am a proud owner of over 20 EWF CDS, which includes every studio album that they ever released, with some compilations.  PEACE. I write because I suffer, Inc. r.l.will.sun 
 While this book deals with military failures, the paralels to running a business or a family are rich and rewarding.  One example: The story of the US failure in Korea, and how certain branches of the armed forces prevailed but other failed was fascinating ... we tend to think of events as successes or failures, but really they are combinations of successes and failures -- studying in a granular, detailed way illuminates both and allows one to succeed overall by cutting failing tactics and replacing them with successful ones.  Many other rich paralels here too.  
 this is to all those who are doubtfull of this story's ending it may seem like a bad ending at first but once you see it for what it is, which a true work of art,you will love this series it is again related to the ending of the show Cowboy Bebop. This is because the creators of Bebop also created Wolf's Rain.Wolf's Rain is one of the best Anime Iv'e ever seen if not the best. In my opinion, it is the best.It is very deep and it is filled with poetry,despair,love and beauty.That is why it is my favorite and always will be 
  "The Purple Rose of Cairo" was the first Allen's movie I saw back in Moscow in the end of the 80s and it started my eternal love for his films. "The Purple Rose..." is wonderful, is one if Allen's greats - a perfect combination of poignancy and humor, romance and drama, reality and fiction. It is the movie-within-the-movie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and Depression Era New York City where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater. The story focuses on Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man (Danny Aiello). Cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities. One day, as she watches "Purple Rose of Cairo" for the 10th or maybe 15th time, the leading man Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) decides to leave the movie and be with Cecilia in real life. His screen partners are left confused and "trapped" in a scene they can't get out of. The live actor who plays Baxter is blamed by the film's producer for his character's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen. Cecilia's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening. On the top of all, Tom Baxters in other theaters try to leave "Purple Rose of Cairo", too... It is not the first or last time Allen has played with the concept of the thin line (in this film, the silver screen) that divides film's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet, gentle, sad, technically realized and simply terrific as "Purple Rose of Cairo".  9.5/10 
 Southern's last novel, completed in 1992, was the result of an on-again, off-again thirty-year effort to write a real exploration of his childhood in rural Texas.  Although it  borrows settings and scenes from stories originally completed  in the 50s, the novel delves much further into the life of  the young Texan Harold and his move into adolescence.  A   strange coming-of-age novel it is indeed, since  Harold's introductions to the world of adult life are not  through baseball, fishing, or books, but through marijuana,  knife fights, and panty-peeping; the book is very much   Southern's version of "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."    A poignant and elegantly comic memoir of youth 
 I'm not really one for writing this sort of thing, so I'll keep it short.  The book is a wonder, and made a week-long business trip that promised to be endless and dull pass like half an hour on a beautiful 1930's train, rushing through the Alps, with a mysterious, charismatic passenger in the seat just across from mine.  Part thriller, part continental romance, I recommend this book for anyone who has a heart (with half a brain attached to it) 
 When `Oliver Twist"'s first installment appeared in 1937, it is probable that not even Charles Dickens was aware that his story about the young orphan-turned-thief would become so timeless. Almost 70 years after its first publishing, the novel is still contemporary, and not only because it deals with human nature, but mostly because it depicts children being exploited by villains.   In this time when children are even trade as slaves in many parts of the world, "Oliver Twist" becomes even more resonant. The novel is a social commentary on the social situation of Britain in the XIX Century. With Oliver (the character) Dickens meant to demonstrate the social situation of his time, when the poor classes were getting even poorer and the rich people richer every day. Above all, the boy's story exposes one of the worst periods in history of Britain for the poor people.  The environment where Oliver spends most of his childhood is populated by thieves, murderers and prostitutes. At the same time, the orphan always meet good people who want to help him, and nevertheless fail. But there is also the Church and the government, and by that time poor people could only be helped if they moved into government workhouses.  One of the most interesting things in "Oliver Twist" is the importance of the characters' names. The name `Oliver Twist' is the clearest example. His surname alludes to his reversal of fortune throughout the story. On the other side, Rose Maylie echoes her youth and beauty, and Mrs Mann lacks maternal instinct.  "Oliver Twist" is an unforgettable book populated by strong characters. Dickens prose is so touching and well developed that has funny and sad moments in the right doses. This is one of the books that stays with the reader long after he/she has finished it. 
 I found this to be a great high definition TV, easy to operate, great picture quality, etc.  Nice style.  Couldn't ask for more and what a bargain! 
 Forget anything you know about hip-hop if you haven't heard this or any other album from Rakim.  Like the Beatles white album, there are just some albums that you have to experience to really know what a form of music is about; this is one of those albums.  Don't mind the samples of it you may have heard in a target add, this is hip-hop at its truest, no marketing gimmicks on this album.  The first thing that may catch your attention is the unique jazz samples Eric B used for the back beats; it's definitely an aspect that peaks the flavor behind the vocal attack of Rakim.  You won't find any party hooks in the lyrics here, none of the lingual laziness of 'hizzle' or 'hurr'.  Rakim's clean language spells it out in bits and pieces to give you a full picture of what hip-hop is all about.  Nothing explains Rakim's style more then  "They never grow old, techniques become antiques  Better then something brand new 'cause it's radiant  And the wild style'll have much more volume  Classical, too intelligent to be radical  Masterful, never irrelevant: mathematical"  This small section explains just how much more of a message there is in his music.  Whether it be the popular (and now thanks to target, commercialized) title track Don't Sweat the Technique or the still relevant Casualties of War, or any of the other tracks on this album, you will no doubt realize how important it is to the over all definition of what hip-hop is 
 The image many people have of Iran is of a nation of fanatical Islamic believers. This book comes to put Iranian society in historical perspective, and emphasize how strong the pre-Islamic Persian culture still is in Iran. As Rubin himself says in an interview in National Review, "Iran's history goes back millennia. It is important to recognize the historical patterns that shape Iranian state and society. We wanted to correct the faulty notion that the Islamic Republic is the natural state of things. Too many books written by academics in the year or two after the Islamic Revolution assumed that the Islamic Revolution represented the natural evolution of Iranian politics. It is now clear that the Revolution was an aberration. This raises the policy question: Should we do anything that helps prolong the system, or will we side with the vast majority of Iranians who hope for change? We can only win if the Iranian people win. And that means not striking any deal which will help preserve the status quo and a theocracy anathema not only to many Iranians, but also to so many religious Shiites." In other words Rubin and Clawson here are echoing the line of Kenneth Timmerman who for some time now has been urging Administration support of dissenting forces in Iran. These by the way are not necessarily democratic forces.  As for the Iranian nuclear danger Rubin and Clawson are convinced that it is real indeed, and not necessarily because Washington is in danger of suffering nuclear attack tomorrow. The authors convincingly paint a picture of an emboldened nuclear Iran able to vastly increase its terrorist activities as it dominates the Gulf and the world oil situation.  This is an important and instructive book about a nation which under its present leadership is a real threat to Mankind.    
 This is an excellent series and one in which we get to learn more about Peabody and her family. I really enjoyed the book. But writing this review 4 1/2 years after September 11, 2001 I've got to say sometimes it was a tough read.  The book was published in 1999 before the terror attacks and speaks of an attack on the Pentagon, that happened on Sept 25 in the fictional NY past (2520 I think) and in the book several New York landmarks are either targeted or actually attacked. Including the Twin Towers. Luckly the Towers weren't a main topic and were only briefly mentioned.   It is still an excellent read, I love the entire series, but a heads up on the content. Set in NY dealing with people who want to blow up NY landmarks 
 Great collection of Religious music done by AJ. Love to hear his voice and this collection you can hear the meaning ever more in his versons of these wonderful hymns. 
 I first heard of this piece when I discovered our local orchestra (which I am in) was to be performing the American premier. Sadly, I waited a long while to get this music, and I am very disappointed in myself that I did.    Jenkins score is both complex and simple, tragic and beautiful all at once. Beautiful music, ranging from incredible dynamics to astounding chorals and so much more, this is certainly worth having on in the backround.   Powerful text and music swirl into a marvelous combination making this an excellent piece that is certainly worth owning. Particularly the Hymn Before Battle and Charge!, which present some of the best music of this recording.   Ten stars, definitely worth getting 
 ... to fill the dry rivers.  The "green revolution", introduced primarily in Asia to grow food for ever-growing populations, has been just one of a range of water-guzzling agricultural systems leading to rivers running dry and water tables sinking to dangerous levels. There are others of course, such as water wastage by urban populations and industry.  But nothing takes so much of the world's most precious liquid as agriculture.  Water, the ultimate renewable resource at the global level, is becoming scarce in many places where it is needed for the survival of plants, animals, and societies. Fred Pearce has criss-crossed the planet investigating a multitude of specific cases where water has literally disappeared and the land been destroyed through salinization, wind erosion and chemical pollution. In others, people continue to waste water for short-term profit as if nobody else was needing some of it.  Many books are appearing on water scarcity and explaining how necessary new thinking on water management is needed at all levels, Pearce takes a direct approach and personalizes his findings. He imparts his discussions with local farmers, community and business leaders, environmental protection agents, politicians and scientists. The approach makes this a very accessible book despite the sombre topic. It is not only ample food for thought but also a call for action and participation. He reminds us forcefully "we all live downstream" from somebody else.  Pearce discusses the overexploitation by commercial agriculture of aquifers, water resources that have been stored in the earth for thousands of years. Cotton and water-intensive crops like rice and alfalfa [for fodder] are being grown despite the dramatically sinking water tables. Rivers are tapped without regard to the danger these "abstractions" cause for the whole watershed and ecosystem.  Rivers are rerouted and dammed to supply water to urban areas or industries in dryer regions.  Reservoirs are constructed to build up water reserves without taking into account that evaporation levels that can more than offset any calculated benefit. Pearce describes some of the most dramatic examples in China. In addition to the well-known Three Gorges Dam project, there are others that literally require moving mountains to get water from the water-rich south to the dryer north. He indicates that there are alternatives being discussed among local scientists.   Rerouting rivers and eliminating the wetlands that allow for natural flood cycles have been common in many places. The results have been dramatically demonstrated during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the spectacular floods in Central Europe during the last few years.  Nature has a way of getting back at these interferences, Pearce demonstrates.    Water resources are a major cause for conflict in and between states. With growing water scarcity these conflicts will increase and explode into wars. One of the most serious and potentially explosive situations exists between Israelis and Palestinians. Palestinians have lost access to their water resources and are prevented by law or the new "security fence" from finding new ones.  Negotiations based on mutual respect and understanding are indispensable to reverse the conflictual circumstances where several countries share river systems, such as the Nile, Brahmaputra, Rio Grande and others.    What is being done? Pearce shares success stories from past and present to demonstrate what can be achieved by taking a different, more ethical, approach to water as a precious and shared resource. Water can be harvested from rain and fog, assisting the replenishment of local water tables. Water flows during floods can be reduced through check dams and other traditional methods that allow the water to sink into the ground rather than run off taking valuable topsoil with it. Examples of water conservation programs are many, demonstrating also that different techniques can be combined, such as water harvesting and flood controls.  For example, Southern California receives fifty percent of the water it needs through rain. "We should be catching our own rain before trying to buy other people's," responded one L.A. environmentalist to Pearce.   While Pearce's book is political in the sense of water management and national policies, it does not tackle one of the key international political debates: water as a "commodity" versus as a vital resource. The privatization of water management systems around the world and its impacts, while of highest importance to people and their right to safe and accessible water, is not addressed here. As other reviewers noted, references to sources are not included. It diminishes the research value of the book to some degree. Still, this "journey into the heart of the world's water crisis" is essential reading for all of us. We all have a role to play to prevent rivers from running dry completely. [Friederike Knabe 
 As a first-year linguistics teacher, I was searching for a complete text. This book is complete, and I have found many supplemental resources online because it is quite popular as a college text. In addition, I have seen the authors cited elsewhere and am confident of the authors' credibility. My only complaint is that the book sometimes defines terms without giving examples and, as far as I know, does not have a teacher's edition 
 Corky Bell is able to relay some very technical aspects of understanding turbo charged engines, in an easy to read and understand format. I highly recommend this to any one considering a turbo for their car, so you don't get lead astray with sales hype 
            The product was both sent and recieved quick and in excellent condition. The person with whom I gave the pajama set to as a gift, was and still is very happy with it. I look foward to further purchases from Amazon, as well as the seller. Sincerely, Christopher L. Vacc 
 this is a lovely book by someone who is practicing what they write ;-)  it is very easy to understand and empathetic to today's work schedules. the drawings are wonderful and very helpful!   i can't wait to give this book as my standard gift this holiday 
 Bound Away by Brandeis University History Professor David Hackett Fischer and James C. Kelley of the Virginia Historical Society is the history of three migrations: to Virginia, within Virginia, and from Virginia.   The first of these migrations, to Virginia from Britain, summarizes Fischer's earlier book, Albion's Seed (see my review) which describes the settlement of Virginia by Anglican-Royalist-Cavaliers from the south and west of England during the period of Cromwell's Puritan Protectorate (1649-1660). This migration pattern continued after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 under the guidance of Sir William Berkley, the governor of Virginia who actively recruited members of this aristocratic group and worked to purge Virginia of Puritans, Quakers and other dissenting groups.  Migration within Virginia resulted in the emergence of the distinctive subcultures of Virginia's regions: the original Tidewater settlements which expanded to the Northern Neck (between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers), Southside (the south-central area bordering on North Carolina), the Eastern Shore (across the Chesapeake Bay), Hampton Roads (the maritime region at the mouth of the Chesapeake), the Piedmont (from the fall line to the Blue Ridge mountains), and the Shenandoah Valley. This period was characterized by increased diversity in the population brought on in part by the Toleration Act in Britain which extended toleration (but not public office) to religious dissenters. Prominent among the Virginians were the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians and various German protestant sects.  Migration from Virginia was already well underway at the time of Virginia ascendancy as first among equal states, the Virginia "Dynasty" of presidents from Jefferson through Monroe, 1801- 1825. Virginia's economy was largely dependent on agriculture, especially tobacco and corn. As the soil became exhausted and other states developed into competitors for these products, Virginia became an exporter of people.  Free whites who chose to emigrate to the new southern states, the southern parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and even farther west. Black slaves were sold to plantations throughout the South while the small number of free blacks emigrated to northern states. Both these migrations dispersed elements of Virginia's cultural traditions throughout significant parts of the country, excepting the northern tier of states.  Throughout the book, a recurring theme is the reevaluation of historian Frederick Jackson Turner's Frontier Thesis. In 1893, Jackson first suggested that the American frontier was a major determining factor in the development of the United States. He proposed that the availability of free land on the frontier promoted the development of freedom and openness in government and society. In addition, he cited the frontier as a melting pot of different cultures in which a new and unique American culture was created by the merging of old cultures in a new environment. Fischer and Kelly take issue with this thesis, pointing out the major influence of cultural continuity in the western migration of Virginians. They also cite the work of other historians, notably the Russian V. O. Kliuchevsky, who cited the availability of free land at the frontier of Tsarist Russia as a factor contributing to the development of governmental and social institutions that were neither free nor open.  Bound Away was particularly interesting to me as a person who has lived most of his life in Virginia, but might not have the same appeal to others. For that reason, I'd recommend Fischer's Albion's Seed as a starting point for exploring migration and cultural continuity in America.   
 Excellent, Excellent Book. Great insights for using proven teaching methods and applying it to Martial Arts. Also other cool stuff! 
   It is the wish of every writer to form a distinct and unique style to separate them from mainstream literature.  Gabriel Garcia Marquez, author of Chronicle of a Death Foretold, once said: "I only write about things I know. People I've seen. I don't analyze."  In this context the unique style reflected in Gabriel Marquez's work reflects a very personalized writing style specific to magical realism.   Chronicle of a Death Foretold was written for the sole purpose of producing a form of fiction that was distinguished from realistic and naturalistic fiction.  It combines both the "truthful and the verifiable" aspects of realism with the magical effects we associate with myth's and folktales.  Marquez uses a technique which is "interweaved, in an ever-shifting pattern, a sharply etched realism in representing ordinary events and descriptive details together with fantastic dream-like elements."1 This style enables the author to vary writing styles throughout the novel from a general view to a much more specific and descriptive form.  Marquez's roots in journalism from his past are allowed to pass through his text into the minds of his reader.    This novel should be classified as one of the "required" reads of our century. Personally I have learned a lot about the various writing styles and techniques Marquez utilizes in this book.  I would strongly recommend this novel!!!    
 I took on a freelance job and needed to get more detailed information/advice regarding motors and motor control.  This book was all I needed.  It's very informative and well written.  It teaches you about the types of motors, how to select the right motor for your application, and finally how to control them using different kinds of circuits and integrated circuits.  If you want to know the mathematical details of torque, how to measure your motor's torque, or how to decipher motor specs, it is all in this book. This book will be a great reference even for someone who already has some knowledge of motors 
 I find Stephen Mitchell's translation far superior to that if The New World Library. Compare this passage:    "Perhaps all dragons in our lives are really princesses just waiting to see us just once being beautiful and courageous."(NWL)     "Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are really princesses waiting for us to act, just once, with beauty and courage."(SM)    I only wish Miller's were as beautifully hard bound as NWL's 
 Easy read.  If you don't know what they book it talking about-- get the book.  If you do know, it will reinforce things.  If you are like me, 1 or 2 little details make it work the read.  Basically, don't forget about your partner.  Things have improved. : 
 Although I can't comment on the return of several main characters, I did enjoy this book a lot.  I was not familiar with Maura and Jane, as I've only read a handful of Tess Gerristen's novels.  But, I thought both characters were rich and quite life-like.  Dr. Maura Isles did not have a huge part in the novel, but she was still a powerful character.  I thoroughly enjoyed Jane Rizzoli.  Her dedication as both mother and cop was great.  The plot of Vanish was also quite good.  A little bit of murder, kidnapping, deceit, government cover-up, and the terrible world of young women sold for sex all mixed into one very entertaining novel.  It was hard for me to put this book down every night or at the end of my lunch break.  I wanted to get to the end, but at the same time did not.  I highly recommend this book, as well as any work by the author.  Her writing is very readable, and her characters rich and believable 
 As a senior in a reading class, I have had to read novels in my English class. i don't like reading but I chose this book because it loked very interesting. Well, i was right. This was a very good book.  It tells about the history of the Hell's Angels and about all the crimes they committed.   the hells angels own mostof the meth around the world. They pay a someone to make it then they sell it. they were bodygaurds for the rolling stones they dont take crap from anybody.   It is a very good book. If you lke excitment, you will like this book. Although the language is kind of bad i recomend this to 16 year old or higher. But other wise it is a good book 
 I knew that I was going to like this but, I did not realize how much unil I read it. Thanks Lisa for this beautiful, touching piece of work and showing an old friend how easy it is to purchase things on line 
  I love this music and cd, yes there are some head scratchers that shouldn't be here like the Cutting Crew, Asia or .38 Special, but than again it was they in the beginning who helped shape the 80's future in the late 70's, so the deserve to be here as well. There are alot of good times on this cd collection that you can't help but think back to a simplier time, and still stands the test of time and still helps the party get rolling today. All the way from .38 Special's 1981 Hold on Loosly, Cheap Tricks 1978 Surrender, Rainbow's 1985 Stone Cold, Warrent's 1990 Cherry Pie down to Firehouse's 1995 Love Of A Lifetime.  Great F**king cd all the way around, may be there can be a follow up with artist say Ozzy, Riot, Hurricane, Kix, Junkyard, and Dangerous Toys to name a few. ROCK ON!!! 
 Painstakingly researched and fluently written this is an above average beside companion to the literary world of James Bond as created by Ian Fleming. This is a definitive work in every respect and comes highly recommended. The revised cover containing several examples of artwork from the old Signet paperbacks is very nostalgic and is an elegiac homage to Fleming! With the release of CASINO ROYALE featuring Daniel Craig as James Bond there has been a resurgence of interest in the Ian Fleming novels. This book is an indispensable companion to Fleming's stories. It is an incredible work. 
 As some reviewer have stated it has paid "careful attention payed to historical fact" I beg to differ. While the movie is highly entertaining and well acted please keep in mind it is a movie. Some facts are to be found but much license has been taken with the facts for story sake. For one Hendrickje Stoffels, engaged as his housekeeper about 1649 some 7 years after the death of his wife. I.E. they never met and there for Rembrandt could not have been tried for adultry, another error. Those are only two, but as I said IT'S A MOVIE not a history lesson. The DVD shows the age of the movie, some effort has been made to improve inage quality and sound  but there still are a few hard cuts and signs of it's age. Well worth watching if you like art or you're just an old movie junkie. I would give it 5 stars but I'm taking one due to the historical errors and no extras on the DVD other than trailers 
 I got this book for my 14 year old brother, and flipped through it before giving it to him.  I was impressed with the style of writing, and the pictures/cartoons, which are fun and enthusiastic, but don't seem childish.  I bought several other copies to give to other teens that I know.  My brother said that he really enjoyed the book.  I wish I would have had a copy of this book when I was a young teen...there's great information to help teens in any situation 
 This book is very informative and well-organized.  It's very easy to find what you're looking for...and it's got it all when it comes to information that pertains to purchasing for the industry.  Very up-to-date...I especially liked the "Technology Applications for Purchasing" chapter 
 This Stephanie Plum novel was somewhat of a disappointment.  I first discovered the Plum novels only after "Eleven on Top" came out.  I read all 11 of them straight through.  Then when I discovered there was a holiday novel I'd missed, I couldn't wait to read it too.  The disappointment was that Joe and Ranger were not characters in this one.  But I did like Diesel.  He's just the kind of sexy "vision" I would expect Stephanie to have.  It is fun, and it has Grandma Mazur, one of my favorite Stephanie Plum characters.  Stephanie Plum fans will enjoy "Visions of Sugar Plums. 
 Good quality paper at good price.  Shipping costs a little bit, but hard to beat the price even with shipping.  Paper fits on 1.5" pvc used with my home built frame.  It does what I need it to 
 This soundtrack, while not James Newton Howard's best soundtrack, has a charm about it that not many other soundtracks posses. It starts slow, but in forty five seconds or so, bang! You are introduced into Howard's Cowboy style composition that personaly enthralls me.   Very good, buy if you love J.N.H's music. 
 I purchased this book on the recommendations of Amazon.com readers.  I was not disappointed.  Tales from Two Pockets is a collection of short-stories by Czech mystery writer and playwrite Karel Capek.  The stories are delightful, with many humorous and unexpected twists. Each story is wholly different from the others, but all are brilliant and a joy to read 
 this album is incredible. there isn't one song on this album that i do not absolutely love. i'll admit that although i have enormous respect for the blues, i'm not intimately familiar with a lot of blues records. i've read that some of the material on this album isn't jonny's original stuff, but in my mind, that doesn't detract too much from this magnificent production. the musicianship is incomparable! jonny's guitar sounds incredible as does every other instrument. being a recording engineer, i cannot say enough about the mixing and production of this record. it has become one of my reference discs when i mix or produce.  there is no way you can go wrong with this cd - it is one of my top 5 albums of all time! cheer 
 I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn how to handle common tasks within Photoshop.  The book targets the novice user who has not yet mastered Photoshop.  Scott Kelby takes a light-hearted approach to many of the common tasks and every step is illustrated with colorful screen shots.  The text avoids technical jargon and is written in conversational language.  The price is right and it is well worth the purchase.  Do not purchase this book if you want to gain a mastery over PS and want to know the intricities of the application 
 I browsed and scanned countless translations of this book.  I already had Mitchell's in mind because I had read his Bhagavad Gita and his Rilke and found it to be amazing.  But all other translations seemed to fall short.  This is by far the best translation of the Tao Te Ching out there.  It is eloquent and beautiful, and simply and subtle.  The poetry of the words is matched well with the unbelievable beauty of the accompanying art.  Buy this book.  Now.  This is the most valuable thing one can read.  If they taught this in high schools the world would be a better place 
 There aren't a lot of Hanukkah albums out there to chose from...The traditionalist ones are,well,traditionalist,and mostly sound like what one might hear at home during the holidays..the non-traditionalist ones on the other hand are mostly weird,novelty items that connect to Hanukkah in the same dubious way that George W.Bush connects to honest,open government...Kenny Ellis has given us a swinging approach to Hanukkah that is not to be missed...Some other artists have come out with thier own Hanukkah albums,but none of these hold a candle to "Hanukkah Swings"...Ellis can both sing and swing,sounding like a sort of mix between Torme and Sinatra,and his renditions will mostly stick in your mind after the album has been put away,which is more than can be said for such drek as the Hanukkah effort put out by the Leevees.. 
 Good book to start your sales career off.  Follows Spencer's other book formats (easy/fast to read).  Book reminds you to keep it simple which, as you know is true for anything.    Like the other person paid full price at a local book store and mad that I did.  Another book that you may want to check out is: "How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling" Frank Bettger 
 First of all, this wasn't even my CD.  We bought it for a father's day gift, but, after one listen-through, I claimed it for my own and it hasn't been out of my CD case since.  It's a great album, with beautiful melodies and great vocal work.    1. Feel- Probably the most rock-influenced track on the CD, it's very high-energy, and a good opening song.    2. Disease- The guitar line at the beginning is great, as is the rest of the instrumentation.  The song is very catchy, and probably what got us interested in the album to begin with.    3. Bright Lights- I love how the first verse/chorus is entirely piano.  It gives it a different feel after two "rock" songs, and Rob Thomas' vocal work is great.    4. Unwell- Not too many popular songs infuse banjo into them, but in "Unwell" it totally makes the song that much better.  Great melody.    5. Cold- Definately one of my favorite tracks.  I love the melody and the guitar line at the beginning, and also how the key changes for the last chorus.    6. All I Need- Nice guitar solo. The song has good lyrics and is overall a pretty good track.    7. Hand Me Down- Another song with excellent lyrics and vocal work.  Very powerful, great melody, and one of the best songs on the album.  Love the guitar work at the end, too.    8. Could I Be You- I like the repeated drumming before the last chorus, and the almost choir-like part at the end.  Great ending, too.    9. Downfall- Another of my personal favorites.  The choir adds a whole lot to the song, the lyrics are great, and the melody is awesome.    10. Soul- A slower-paced song, but still very nice, and the chorus changes the sound of the piece a lot.    11. You're So Real- Really like the bass throughout the first verse, then how the rest of the instruments come in.  One of the faster songs, especially with the vocals.    12. The Difference- Another favorite of mine.  This song has two parts, the first one being a beatiful, melodic, slow song, which is the one I especially like.  More great songwriting and a haunting piece.  The second one picks up a lot, with a good guitar line, and I like the drum backing during the verses.  A high-energy piece that's good to end an album with.  
 Forty-something homemaker and budding food columnist, Carolyn Blue has always been satisfied with her life. She's the wife of a respectable, if not slightly offbeat professor, and actually enjoys spending her days doing laundry, cooking lavish dinners, and raising her two children. However, now that her kids have moved off to college, Carolyn finds herself tired of the same old, same old. She longs for a taste of adventure that will give her the chance to step away from the steaming stove, and embrace the outdoors. And, since her recent move to El Paso, Texas, Carolyn thinks that now is a better time than any to reinvent herself. So when she's given the opportunity to be a food writer, she instantly jumps at the chance. Accompanying her husband, Jason, to New Orleans for a conference, Carolyn is planning on doing research for her debut book "Eating Out In the Big Easy," by doing just that - sampling the wonderful tastes that New Orleans has to offer, while, at the same time, getting together with her college buddies to share notes on parenthood, and see how they've changed over the years. And boy have they changed. On her first night in New Orleans, Nancy is shocked to see what her pals have become, and is even more upset to see that her best friend, Julienne, is fighting non-stop with her uncaring husband, Nils. After a reunion dinner full of disagreements, and a stormy walk-out by Julienne, Carolyn is left feeling slightly unsettled - and it's not from the cuisine, which was absolutely marvelous. Carolyn believes that there is something more to the blow-up between Nils and Julienne. However, knowing that couples often fight, she tries to put her worries aside. When Julienne is never seen again, however, she realizes that something fishy is in the air - and it's not the smell of succulent crawfish. As a matter of fact, the only thing that can be blamed for the smell is Nils' refusal to report his wife as a missing person, or even acknowledge her disappearance as anything more than Julienne being Julienne. But Carolyn knows better. She grew up with Julienne, and knows that she wouldn't just run off, leaving her friends in a state of fear. Unfortunately, aside from Jason, and the hunky Big Easy officer, Lieutenant Boudreaux, everyone surrounding Carolyn refuses to take Julienne's disappearance seriously, preferring to spend their time in New Orleans attending conferences, and purchasing ridiculously priced paintings. Now, in between visiting as many Cajun and Creole-based restaurants as research for her book, and sampling newfangled recipes for bread pudding and creme brulee, Carolyn has taken it upon herself to investigate Julienne's disappearance, and find her childhood friend before her plane heads back to El Paso. But if she's not careful, instead of flying first-class, Carolyn may just be making her way back home in a bodybag.   As a Food Network aficionado, and a fan of travel shows, I was ecstatic to learn that Nancy Fairbanks' CRIME BRULEE touched on both of these subjects. I must admit, however, that from page one, I was slightly unimpressed. The characters are stuffy, pretentious, middle-aged bores, who feel that it is necessary to do nothing more than brag about their monthly (and, oft-times, hourly) incomes, and try to one-up one another with their tales about their equally spoiled offspring. Their disregard for the fact that their supposed longtime friend is missing is unusual and suspicious in itself, yet it's their behavior towards one another that puts the reader off. These supposed friends seem to despise each other immensely, and honestly could care less whether they are dead or alive. They have one main concern: themselves, and that never wavers once throughout the sordid tale. Add to this the fact that each character seems bigoted and prejudiced just from the way that they refer to people who are not middle to upper class Caucasians, and you're left with one big mess. I can say that the main character, Carolyn Blue, is appealing. However, Carolyn appears to lack real depth. She is more like a character sketch, who has very little personality, and, thus far, is only visible from the surface. She's not very personable, and, though she is fun, we never learn much about her past. I did find the excerpts from the main characters book at the beginning of almost every chapter to be fascinating, and loved the tour of the Big Easy, as well as the recipes dotting certain chapters. I almost felt as if I were on an episode of Rachael Ray's TV show "$40 A Day," as I followed Carolyn and her cronies to various New Orleans hotspots and eateries. The mystery was also quite entertaining, and I believe that with a bit of fine-tuning, and the exclusion of the supporting cast of characters, Nancy Fairbanks' next installment has the potential to be scrumptious. A concoction that is oft-times hard to swallow.  Erika Sorocco Freelance Reviewer 
 these books r soooooo cool! i didnt really like the ashley part of the book.i would have put 4, but the ruth and hank part made up for the 5th star. it must be sad for ruth seeing her father fade away like that. it is so cool how ty understands wat ruth is going thru. I AM A HUGE HEARTLAND FAN AND I HAVE READ EVERY BOOK XCEPT FOR ALWAYS THERE AND FROM THIS DAY ON. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES! : 
 I got hooked on The Beatles' music by listening to my parents' records as a child. I have collected all of their albums on CD up through Rubber Soul. In my opinion, I think that Rubber Soul is their best album. Shows the band at the height of their career. Their songwriting had become more mature and less teenybopperish. After Rubber Soul, their albums are more drug-influenced and less of a group effort and their songwriting becomes sub-par, with the exception of a few gems here and there. To here those few gems, I recommend getting Beatles 1 
 I consider this book as a signal processing enabling book and I use it with my students at the University  as an introduction, previous to networking or Multimedia specific subjects.  I recommend this book to  anyone who is looking for a gentle introduction to digital signal  processing, and is no willing to pass through a high math path. The math's  are there but in their just proportion. The author is concerned about  concepts, and the movies on the CD are of great help in order to get them.  Th introduction to complex notation, difference equations and convolution  are the gentles I've read. If you manage to solve the numeric exercises,  you end with working concepts and skills in the area.  The authors try to  give examples from several fields like sounds, pictures and video in order  to make the material understandable. Its not a very rigorous book but is a  valuable one if you prefer concepts to mathematical rigor. 	After  working the proposed projects, you can deal with filtering, image analysis,  sampling, aliasing and several other signal processing techniques knowing  what you are doing 
 I was so glad to see the girls back together to do 1 more album. This album is short but swet and a must have for any DC3 fan out there. Beyonce and Kelly sound better than ever and Michelle just sounds weird. Anywayz  the best tracks on Destiny Fulfilled are: 1.Lose My Breath - Great choice for first single and was a great club banger. The video was hott and Beyonce's abs never looked better.10/10 2.Soldier - Great choice for 2nd single. The beat is so great and the girls sounded awesome.10/10 3.Cater To U - Sexy video and was a great choice for last single off Destiny's Fulfilled. Beautiful song for your man to show him that you're gone cater to his every need.This has got to be my favourite song on this record.10/10 4.T Shirt - Such a sexy song and should've been released instead of Girl. I know that the video would've been sexy as well. This is one of my favourite songs after Cater To U.10/10. 5.Is She The Reason - This song is ok but I'm sure that every girl can relate.7/10. 6.Girl - This song is alright and shouldnt have been released as a single. The video was cool though but only because of the Sex And City plot.7/10. 7.Bad habit - I love this song. 8/10. 10Through With Love -Great song and should've been released as a single. Beyonce and Kelly sound great and so does Michelle.10/10. 11.Love - Such a great way to end the album. Such a beautiful song about being in love and makes us all believe that there is a special someone out there for each of us.10/10. Great album even tho it seemed like it was rushed. 
 The second edition of Linda N. Edelstein, Ph.D.'s WRITER'S GUIDE TO CHARACTER TRAITS provides over 400 reference lists of character traits from a range of behaviors, paired with tips on how to incorporate these traits into a plot and build upon it. This is a psychology primer paired with a writer's guide: a unique approach which takes common psychology, explains it for a lay writer's community, then melds it into plot development basics 
 Also purchased 2 sets for College Dorm use. They recommended Extra Long Twin Sheets for the beds. Good sheets are hard to find at a reasonable price! These sheets are really nice and warm in winter and cool in summer at a very good price 
 Stanford Wong wrote the single best volume for the beginner to intermediate sports bettor (with an emphasis on football). The book teaches the basics of sportsbetting, terminology, understanding odds, and methods to make bets that should win in the long-term. This is an excellent primer on someone who is serious about making money from sports.  The material is slightly dated - internet betting has made the sports markets more efficient. Notwithstanding this, most of the material is still useful (notable exceptions are trends of super bowl teams, and some underdog analysis).   There is a recurring emphasis on mathematics, which any solid gambling book should have. Additionally, the book has several charts that are invaluable to sports bettors. It has frequences of pushes for NFL against different spreads, as well as different totals (these have not changed significantly since the book was published). Additionally, it has odds charts for Poisson distributions for 1 and 2 variables. While an advanced gambler could generate all these charts themselves, this book still saves the newer gamblers many hours - and the book is worth it for these alone.  If you are serious about gambling to win (which means you are willing to put in long hours, and are very disciplined), there are a few other books you might consider: any of Stanford Wong's Blackjack Books; Larry Seidel's "Investing in College Basketball" and Don Pesynski's "Win more-- lose less!". 
 I am  50 yrs. old, and am a 5 yr Breast Cancer survivor. I had a mastectomy and 6 mos.of chemotherapy.My breast cancer was "estrogen"related, but it was also non-invasive, caught very early.With the help of God, I have overcome all obstacles.I also chose reconstructive surgery.Having had chemotherapy,I became menopausal. My quality of life changed drastically,I felt like I was just existing. I enjoyed nothing, nor wanted to be sociable anymore. I felt like I had no emotions.I became very insecure,irritable and negative. I KNEW something was wrong, but I was determined not to accept it as"just getting old".After all my  LIFE was just beginning again. I started seeing a Psychiatrist, and went to the library and read Dr.Claire Wargasbook, Menopause and the Mind. All the emotions I had been feeling were in her book! I RAN to my oncologist & gynocoligist.Aftersome blood work, I was recommended by BOTH to get on the estrogen.My whole life has changed in a matter of days,I elected the Estradial patch with progesterone.Within days (2) I felt alert,active and Alive again. I am starting to feel feminine, and wanting to be around people. Suffice to say, at the second session with the Psychiatrist,she told me I did not need to return, my whole outlook had changed! I cannot express the change of positive emotions I have experienced. Instead of existing I am living. Because I am "high risk"so they say, I will continue to be monitered carefully, This has been my decision after researching data on estrogen and the mind, as opposed to estrogen and breastcancer. PLEASE READ DR. CLAIRE WARGA'S BOOK about Menopause and the Mind, IT CHANGED MY LIFE!! 
 Violet and Klaus are stuck in a wagon rolling the cliffs of the Mortmain Mountains. While there sister Sunny was kidnapped by Count Olaf. Violet and Klaus are left for dead. The two Baudelaires must make a dangerous climb up the mountain to save their little sister.  A lot of things get in there way, but one good thing happens to them, they meet a mysterious friend that will help them on there journey to stop Olaf and save Sunny. Does Violet nd Klaus rescue there sister or does Coult Olaf keep hiding. I'm going to leave it for you to find out.   I thought this book was great, I loved how Lemony Snicket kept talking to you throughout the story. I loved the ending of the book because it just doesn't end it keeps you guessing on what is coming next. I think that, if anyone likes mystery or suspence this is a great book for you. 
 It is a book that you have to read if you want to know how a very succesful make it 
 This is a great book to sit down with on a cold weekend.  Just grab a quilt and let yourself be taken to the South where the author writes about his life.  Not one of them boring autobiographies but a good story 
 I groaned when a fellow Eastern Orthodox Christian, a former Protestant, lent me this book.  Reading it, however, I became hooked; I was more than pleasantly surprised.  NT Wright's "daring" view of St. Paul is old hat, or should be, to Orthodox Christians, but it's still refreshing and illuminating to read what he has to say, even if the Church (the Orthodox Church) would find nothing very new in it.  The only question that remains is--why shouldn't Wright, now an Anglican bishop, make the jump to Orthodoxy?  His ecclesiastical messmates, as it were, are not even sure of Christ's divinity, so one wonders when Bishop Wright will make himself honest, or at least put himself in like-minded company.  In any case, this work is highly recommended 
 SIGN OF THE BEAVER REVIEW   Elizabeth George Speare writes in a fashion that always gives you something new to be excited about and lets you exist in her writing.  This heart stopping book will delight those who love a creative mix of drama, adventure, friendship, and well-paced wording.  I'm sure those people will agree with me that describing this as a good book is an understatement.  It tells of a settler boy and an Indian boy who meet and have many adventures in the woods of Maine.  The characters are wonderful because their personalities are almost everyone in the world.  I do not know a single person that cannot relate to these characters.  In general, it's a two thumbs up read.   
 It is a very easy to read book but don't get me wrong, it is worth! Although it is a fable, it is a great mind shaker.. 
 I started reading "Reckless" one evening just to "get a feel" for the book. I couldn't put it down and finally had to turn out the light at 1:30am. I love the format and Author Gloria Mattioni makes it very personal, so one feels that you know her story as well. It's very empowering to be able to learn the stories of Fabulous Women. I found the book to be interesting, informative, inspirational, intellectual and personal. And what a charming photo of the author!  OH, I hope you are working on Volumn II;  we women can't have too many powerful role models!  
 I believe, the title should have been essays about India, less of an eye - catcher, but closer to the content of the book. Mr. Sen grew up near Caluctta, but he must have spent a lot of time in the USA. He considers himself an Indian (as apparently some of the reviewers with Indian names but US addresses....), and he clearly states so in the preface of the book. He seems to have lived abroad long enough to have a balanced view about India, something rarely found amongst Indians. His articles are superbly reasoned! Even if one does not agree with all of his points, one must always admit, that his reasoning is simply impeccable.  I believe, this book gives a good, and for the most part well balanced view of India.      
 This book is principally an examination and explanation of how the West has seen the philosophies, religions and cultures of the Far East - chiefly of China and India.  To this interest in the East Clarke gives the name Orientalism.  That word since 1985 has carried the connotation that Edward Said gave to it in his book of that name.  Though that work concerned itself chiefly with the Arab Middle East, other scholars have applied Said's characterization to the western study of cultures further East.  That school of thought saw Orientalism as permeated with condescending, exploitative and colonialist attitudes, and scarcely allowed any other factors to play a role.  Clarke admits that colonial attitudes were one aspect of Orientalism, but his study demonstrates that there were many others.  True, students of Orientalism, like students of all  other subjects, cannot help having agendas, and agendas are liable to lead to distortions. So the West's interpretations of the Orient (the word `hermeneutic' turns up with rather tiresome frequency in this text) generally fulfil some need felt by the West; but this is often not at all a need to exploit the East, but rather to gain through Oriental studies a new and enriching perspective on Western culture and frequently to provide a remedy for what are perceived to be its flaws or discontents.   Clarke argues, along with other scholars whom he cites, that in the West the Renaissance and the Reformation ushered in a philosophical restlessness and uncertainty which made Europeans be more inquisitive and open to other ways of thinking. This uncertainty was generated from within European culture,  whereas in Asia it was only when Western technology and power irrupted into the area that the interest of Asians in European culture began, in response to a challenge from outside rather than from within their own culture.  Clarke acknowledges this interest, but devotes only a small part of the book to the impact of Western thought on Asia.  He documents how in the 18th century the philosophes set up their rosy view of Confucian China in opposition to the religious and social criticisms they made of their own society; how, when this interest faded, it was replaced in the 19th century by the interest of the Romantics in Indian thought. We learn of Anquetil Duperron (1723 to 1805) who first translated the Upanishads (into French) and of William Jones (1746 to 1794), who showed that most European languages have an affinity with Sanskrit, which suggested that many of the peoples of Europe came originally from Asia.  German nationalists, resenting French cultural hegemony, preferred the idea that their culture was rooted in the Aryan languages (and later, by a perversion of the word, in the Aryan race).  Philosophically also, the most profound impact of Indian thought was on a line of German philosophers: Hegel, Schelling, Schlegel and Schopenhauer saw an affinity between the monism of the Absolute and that of Brahman, between their own metaphysical ideas that the world as we know it through our senses is not the real world and the Indian notion that we see the world only through the veil of maya.  Both Confucianism and Buddhism were seen by  many Europeans as a system of ethics which was independent of a belief in God, and was therefore espoused by many western thinkers in reaction  to the claims that religion was the essential basis of ethics.  Towards the end of the 19th century and into the twentieth, at the very time when the West's cultural imperialism emphasized by Edward Said was at its height, there was also the countervailing current that the West's cultural hegemony was increasingly questioned in the West itself; and the interest in Eastern ideas became a broad stream with wide diffusion.  Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 to 1882) and Henry David Thoreau (1817 to 1862) popularized Eastern thought in America on a scale that earlier thinkers had not been able to achieve.  Edwin Arnold's poem The Light of Asia (1879), disseminated the Buddhist message and sold nearly a million copies.  The Theosophical Society, founded by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Alcott in 1875, had over 45,000 members in 1920.  It was strongly infused with oriental ideas, and  even played a part in the revival of Hindu and Buddhist self-awareness and self-respect in Asia itself. Some Western actually thought that western civilization, with its frenetic materialism and its spiritual life eroded by rationalism, was worn out and needed to draw on Eastern thought to renew itself.  Eastern influences have moved out of the academic and literary world to permeate the very life-style of many westerners.    So Zen and Tibetan Buddhism have found many followers in the West; there are now many practitioners of t'ai chi, yoga and  transcendental meditation;  the young have gone on the hippy trail to visited ashrams in India.  From this point onwards, about half way through the book,  Clarke produces so many examples of the interaction between East and  West - on literature, on the arts, on religion, on psychotherapy, on holistic medicine, on ecological thinking, on non-violence, even on the philosophy of modern physics (though, curiously, only marginally on the mainstreams of western academic philosophy) - that a short review like this cannot do justice to them.  There was even a strand in fascism which claimed an Oriental heritage. Clarke's range is truly encyclopaedic, and in this second half of the book that there will be found much detailed material and many names that are likely to be unfamiliar to the educated non-specialist.  The mainly narrative chapters are followed by two final superb reflective ones.  In the first of these Clarke reflects on the philosophical traps into which Orientalism can fall and sometimes has fallen, but his defence of the value of Orientalism is eloquent and persuasive. In the second (more difficult) one he shows how deconstructive Post-Modernism  challenges Orientalism but can also find an ally in it 
 I like the above bible very much but shipping cost is abit expensive 
 How one can doubt that Albedo 0.39 is one of the best albums Vangelis has ever published? Mixing now with then, tomorrow with today, it makes you think listening to Alpha and "flying" listening Pulstar and Nucleogenesis Part 1(Vangelis always use to give greek-rooted names to his songs). Being a greek, i can be proud that a greek composer can represent so well New Age. (Sorry about my awkard English, i'm still a greek!!). Don't forget to listen to Alpha with eyes closed!!!!!! 
 Reasons to own this set:  First: Patrick McGoohan. A young Patrick McGoohan. If that isn't reason enough for you to run out and seize this set, you are made of tougher stuff than I. Women want to be with him, men want to be him (wait, that's Austin Powers...still....)   Second: the screenplays are absolute marvels. Even though these are half-hour episodes, the writing is tight as can be. These seem like full-length films. You can't take your eyes off for a second as the action is nonstop.   Third: these period pieces, filmed at the height of the Cold War are the real spy genre. John Drake (McGoohan's character, later transformed into Secret Agent) is the cool, "I don't do wet-work", get the job done action man. It was reported that McGoohan turned down the job of James Bond because the Bond role required jumping in and out of beds and doing a lot of killing; John Drake rescues damsels in distress, not dames in a state of undress.   We ration out watching McGoohan trudging around Portmerion-as-Italy or on location in some other places and it never, ever palls. For Prisoner fans, this is a must-have as a precursor to that iconic series. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all fans of spy drama 
 "Going Down" is more than a story about a call girl. This book is very well written and multi-layered. On the surface, you have the story of college student Bennington becoming a call girl, and all that ensues. This makes for an interesting read, and I was engaged, getting a glimpse into Benny's life, her experiences as a call girl and her days in the brothel, which were both humorous and sad. Jennifer Belle is very, very funny, and sharp-witted. What I love about her writing style is that she makes her lead characters uncensored in what they think and say. The sub-stories of this book concern women's roles and self-esteem, sex and love, and the dynamics and power within relationships between men and women, particularly Benny's with her father. There is an interesting exchange between Benny and one client who is utterly conflicted (...). The novel is well thought-out, and every event, large and small, is connected and tied up by the finish, which I appreciate. There's nothing that feels false, the characters are very interesting and multi-faceted, and I found the book to be a very satisfying read 
 Man, I've read 'em all and this is the champ home studio guide. I used to think it was McLan's first-"The Musician's Guide to Home Recording", but he's outdone himself on this one. I love it 
 WOW! What a terrific end to a great story. Jane Kirkpatrick is a master story teller. The way she weaves fact with fiction to end with an exciting and believable finish is pure magic. This book is great on so many levels. It is an inspirational story of a woman's struggle against all odds at a time and in a place that made life for a woman very difficult. It certainly is a well researched historical novel. Beyond that it is a love story - of a woman for her God, her family, her neighbors and a new land just beginning to be "civilized." If you can only read one book this summer - this is it. However, I would recommend starting with "A Name of Her Own" the first book in the Tender Ties series 
 This review will discuss the book and online debate about Mr. Tsatsouline and his methods.  The obvious:  Cons - Short book for an unproportional amount of money.  Pros - Short book, to the point, worth the money!  The total book will be a quick read and initially you may think that he charges too much for too little. Obviously, you have not read the book or tried the methods therein. I too was aprehensive of the book at the set price, but I followed my intuition and dove right in.   The book presents a myriad of exercises devoted to strengthening your core muscles. Will you slim down? Maybe, but how does your diet look? Will you get a six-pack? Maybe, but again how is your diet and what are genes doing phenotypically? This book is directed at building power, effectively, for tactical, martial and practical purposes.  Yes, he markets his Ab Pavelizer, along with all his other products and some select Dragon Door products. Yes, he charges $35 for his book. Look at it this way. He comes from Russia, knows the hardships of Communism and the aftermath of it. He says himself how he has turned in to a "Capitalist Dog." You must have a sense of humor and laugh at jokes. Or be completely analytical and criticize he efforts to: make you smile and himself laugh. I can smile at his humor, read his book with ease and benefit form his teachings.   With that point made, his book is very user friendly! You need no degrees or special formulas to understand his writing. In that his book can be for almost anyone.   Since it is short, it must be concise for the reader to get a good understanding of the exercises to undertake it themselves. As well, there are enough exercises, with variations for beginners to advanced athletes to design a proper program based on their needs and wants (to a point!).  Contained in the book is a Q & A section with some commonly asked questions or already asked questions (I assume). Also, if you do decide to buy a Pavelizer, contained is a nice little section devoted to training with it. But thanks to Mike Mahler, I learned how to do it solo, with two KBs or anything else you can find and let your imagination create a way.   Pavel, cites his sources when necessary, so question scientific evidence and hard-earned experience if you must. Or experiment yourself and find out first hand if the claims are true.  The book presents fundamental principles on various subjects, a brief touch of : -basic biomechanics -basic lifting protocol -basic physiology -basic anatomy -basic breathing protocol (Power Breathing)  When I say "basic" I mean basic. This book in no way implies it contains exhaustive explanations of any of the above. It does though, detail the performance of each exercise with suitable pictures. I have not viewd the complimenting videos / DVDs but I am sure they would be of great value to those visual learners out there. But if you have a good imagination, some experience with movement, and a good understanding of what he wrote, you can manage splendidly.  I feel this book is of value to martial artists (in Traditional / Classical arts - Karate, Muay Thai, MMA, TKD, Boxing, etc.), tactical operators (SWAT, LEO, Special Ops, etc.), athletes (football, track, soccer, baseball, etc.), and everyday Americans. This book is valid for building pure, raw strength.  I took this as a stepping stone / supplemental / simple way to enhance my own personal training. For further studies I suggest more of Pavel Tsatsouline's products for those who like simple solutions to simple goals at DRAGONDOOR.COM. For more sophisticated actions and exhaustive explanations, I suggest Scott Sonnon's materials at RMAX.TV.  
 Caution, the book presumes readers understand databases organize data in tables and SQL inserts, updates, queries and deletes the data. If you do understand that but struggle with SQL syntax, this book is a great summary of SQL. It is well organized, clearly written with working examples to get you started quickly.  The book is more or less focused on MySQL and Oracle syntax, which means Itzik Ben-Gan's book on T-SQL is a better alternative for SQL Server folks. Also, advanced non-portable features are not well developed for either MySQL or Oracle.  It is rated 4 because it fails to explain the when and why in some places 
 This is a thorough beginners book on options but I found it too achedemic at times 
 It was a fun read. It offered a new look at the detective outside of her familiar home land of Australia. The story kept me wondering till the end 
 There are reams and reams of investment valuation books on the market -- that is obvious.  In my opinion, the three no one should be without are Applied Equity Analysis,  Stephen Penman's monster tome "financial statements and...", and lastly, Aswath Damadoran's book, "investment valuation."  Most hyperventilating MBAs default to Damadoran; I really enjoy the simplicity behind Applied Equity Analysis.  Caution: Neither of the 3 are what you'd call "light reading."  If you have any money left, honorable mention goes to Cooke's "security analysis on wall street. 
 Really clears up the beginning of the Bible and the beginning of man.  If you want to study creation this book is great. I highly recommend it to all Bible students, especially those in private study 
 This book is great. I'm not even finshed with it yet and already I've learned a lot. It's full of usefull tips that I never learned in school. It is a wlecome contrast to the many industry books that show you lot of examples but no explanations for the principles behind the design. I would highly recommend this book 
 Robert K. Ressler left the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit twelve years ago to venture into private practice as a criminologist. He retired with thirty years of investigative experience (ten with the U.S. Army's CID and twenty with the FBI, many of them as director of the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP)).  This book is one of his many attempts to speak from the belly of the monster that has devoured him...in fact the book that follows this one is actually called "I Have Lived in the Monster."   "Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice."  (Jonah 2:2)  So what does our modern-day prophet, Robert K. Ressler cry out of the belly of the beast?  Credit for coining the phrase "serial killer" is commonly (and mistakenly) given to Ressler, one of the founding members of the FBI's elite Behavioral Science Unit.  Along with his colleague John Douglas, Ressler also served as a model for the character 'Jack Crawford' in Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter trilogy.  "Whoever Fights Monsters" is subtitled "My Twenty Years Tracking Serial Killers for the FBI" and if you read true crime books, you will recognize many of the monsters that Ressler describes and interviews.  A miscellaneous look at the photo captions will give you an idea of whose minds he attempted to probe:    *	"One of two blenders used by the Sacramento 'Vampire Killer'... to prepare human blood and organs for ingesting to 'stop his blood from turning to powder'"  *	"Tattoos on the arm of Richard Speck, which led to his arrest in the murders of eight women in Chicago in 1966"  *	"Photograph taken of the leg of a Brudos victim.  This captures the essence of his bizarre fetish fantasies--women's feet in high-heeled shoes"   A well-known review service complains that "as deeply as Ressler gets into killers' heads...he refused to reveal much of his own here, offering no explanation ... for why he's devoted his life to a calling so dire and soul-wearing..."  Actually, I believe Ressler reveals quite a bit of himself in his books.  I read him as a man who is easy to admire, but hard to like.  I'm sure some of the other law enforcement officers who had to work with him found his techniques and pronouncements a bit grating. They might have also gotten the notion that he was hogging the limelight.  Ressler does not keep quiet about crime scenes where he thinks the cops screwed up, and uses the 'fiasco' of Henry Lucas's murder confessions as an example of bad police work.  Two reporters working for the "Dallas Times" finally did the spadework on Lucas's stories and determined that he couldn't possibly have killed the hundreds of the victims he claimed to have done in.  Sometimes he wasn't even physically in the state, e.g. Florida, when the victim was murdered.  By the time the dust had settled, and Ressler interviewed Lucas, the con admitted that he had killed "fewer than ten, perhaps five."  One of the services that I wouldn't trust anyone but Ressler (and maybe a few others) to perform is to interview serial killers and determine the 'how' and 'why' of what they did.  Ressler describes a few cases where his testimony tipped the balance as to whether a former killer who has served his time, should be paroled.  It seems as though the psychopathic personality is good at fooling parole boards and psychologists by the depth of his remorse, and by his long stretch of sterling behavior in prison (during his first incarceration, John Wayne Gacy started up a prison branch of the JayCees)---but the psychopath doesn't fool Ressler at all.  He's gotten into the hearts and minds of too many of them.  One of the definitions of 'prophet' is "a person gifted with profound moral insight and exceptional powers of expression...a predictor; a soothsayer."  We may not want to listen to this prickly prophet Ressler, who speaks of demons in our midst, and who predicts their behavior if they are sent back out into society.  But for the sake of our loved ones and friends, we really should listen. 
 This is the best complilation of ancient Chinese martial philosophy I have ever come across. The translation is superb, and it is extensively footnoted to give the reader a complete understanding of the context of the  translations and their meaning. It's of a much higher quality then most  other translations. For example, I enjoyed dearly the Thomas Cleary trans.  of "The Art of War" because of the clear and simple text.  However, the Sawyer's trans. "The Art of War" had much more of  the subtle nuances of the original by expanding the vocabulary and giving  extensive footnotes. The rest of the trans. in the book are perhaps lesser  known but equally impressive works. Overall, I felt the book provides the  reader with a comprensive view of ancient Chinese strategy and is essential  for anyone who wishes to study this subject 
 Both items ordered arrived at my home in a timely manner and were in good condition. 
 With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.    The quality is great, but the video stutters in Unbox.  Maybe because it uses 3 applications when playing video?  I chose to watch the episode on Windows Media Player 11 and I had no problems at all.  I've bought and watched 3 episodes, all with the same results.  Fast and unobstrusive download, great quality and low price.  Just use WMP, or another player that can handle wma files, to watch.      
 Woody Allen's 1992 film "Husbands and Wives" was released around the time we first heard the words Soon-Yi, which is ironic considering the subject matter of the film. "Husbands and Wives" is billed as a comedy, but is more of a drama. There are a few jokes, but there's nothing incredibly funny in the film. The movie is told like a documentary, featuring interviews with the characters and handheld cinematography. Allen and Mia Farrow play Gabe and Judy Roth, a couple who have been married for ten years and think everything is well. Then their two friends Jack and Sally (Sydney Pollack & Judy Davis) announce they are getting divorced, which causes Gabe and Judy to question the validity of their own marriage. As Jack and Sally move on (with Jack getting a much hotter younger woman and Sally lusting after Michael, played by Liam Neeson), Gabe and Judy begin to move farther apart. Gabe, a college professor, finds himself falling for a 20-year-old student named Rain (Juliette Lewis) and Judy finds herself, also, lusting after Michael. The movie is 106 minutes, but a lot of stuff happens in the film. This is not one of Woody Allen's best; it's not in the top 5 anyway. It's overwrought and is not his most entertaining. The performances are very good, especially Farrow, Pollack, and Davis. Juliette Lewis, meanwhile, has echoes of Mariel Hemingway in "Manhattan" in her performance. The cinematography and mock-documentary style of the film gets old after a while, with the former getting headache-inducing after a while. "Husbands and Wives" is a good study of marriage and infidelity. One critic (I don't recall which one it was) said that "Husbands and Wives" seemed like Allen trying to come to grips with the Soon-Yi debacle, but the ending here is quite different. "Husbands and Wives" has its merits, it's demerits...But it's a worthy Woody Allen film that's definitely worth watching.  GRADE: B 
 I've read more than a few books on golf instruction.  Percy Boomer's book is without a doubt the best of the lot.  I don't know whether Mr. Boomer was ahead of his time or whether modern golf instruction just lost its way somewhere along the road.  The fact is that these old time pros knew what they were doing.  The "tricks" and "tips" of today's pros found in the pages of golf digest etc. are just that.  Let Mr. Boomer show you how to build a repeatable swing that will produce consistent results.  You won't be disappointed.  My only regret is that he's not still around to give lessons 
 I picked this book up randomly, at a thrift store, but I am always fascinated by non-fiction books that offer glimpses into other cultures and in books that look at the assimilation or non-assimilation of various groups into the American mainstream.  POSTVILLE: A CLASH OF CULTURES IN THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA is the portrait of a typical small midwestern town (almost stereotypical, as the author waxes on about parades, agricultural festivals, and kids who don't have to lock up their bikes in front of the corner stores) trying to come to grips with a settlement of militantly anti-assimilationist settlers in their midst:  a group of Hassidic Lubavitcher Jews who have purchased the closed meat packing plant and reopened it as kosher slaughterhouse, bringing economic life back to the town but unearthing a host of conflicts with the locals over a host of issues of custom and lifestyle.  Many of the reviews of POSTVILLE here take issue with the author coming down on one side or the other of the division in Postville, Iowa and thus finding the book flawed because it is not objective.  But Bloom never pretends to be writing an objective or sociological treatise.  The book is as much a memoir of his own coming to terms with his internal conflict between his Jewishness and his feelings of being a fish out of water in Iowa, and his longing to find a place that he fits in--is it by a deeper embrace of his Jewishness and thus his differences, or by further assimilation?  A main part--if not the main point-- of the story is his own developing attitudes and his eventual realization that he has chosen to support one side--and thus one way of life--over the other.  Over a period of several years, Bloom makes trip after trip to Postville, at first drawn by the incongruous settlement of Jews there, and perhaps seeking a spiritual connection and answer to his own feelings of isolation.  Bloom becomes fascinated with the schisms in Postville between the native (and nearly 100% Christian) Iowans and the Jewish newcomers who seem determined to stay separate and who seemingly deliberately flout local conventions of politeness, neatness and unassuming behavior.    As Bloom interviews numerous people in Postville, both Jewish newcomers and Postville natives, the schism in the town gradually coalesces around the issue of a referendum on annexing the land that the slaughterhouse is on, allowing the town to possibly exert more control over the business there and by extension, perhaps, the Jews.  Both the native Iowans and several of the Lubavitchers reach out to him, telling him of their viewpoints and trying to recruit him to their point of view.  Bloom reports what he is shown by both sides, and in the end finds that he comes to support the native Iowans rather than the Jews.  He does seem to give breaks to the native Iowans for sometimes nakedly anti-semitic statements (particularly when they move from concrete, personally unpleasant experiences with individual Lubavitchers in the town to generalizations about "the Jews" and the way all Jews are.  On the other hand, some of the unpleasant behaviors of some of the Jews in the town feed entirely too neatly into a larger world of nasty stereotypes waiting to be applied.)  Bloom's conclusion seems to be that the Iowans he deals with, both in Postville and in Iowa City, are by nature of long isolation and homogeneity suspicious of and slow to welcome any outsiders, Jewish or otherwise, and that they are willing to try to get along with people who try to get along with them.  The Lubavitchers, with their unconcealed attitudes of superiority, their rufusal to moderate even some of their behaviors in deference to local custom (even behaviors that don't infringe at all on their beliefs, such as keeping their yards neat or refraining from attempting to bargain prices at the stores, which the townsfolk see as insulting) and their complete disinterest in having any sort of relationship with the people they are living alongside, consistently show no inclination at all to try to get along.  And Bloom, as a Jew and an outsider, ultimately chooses the path of trying to fit in over that of flaunting his difference.  He chooses as his role model Doc Wolf, the legendary doctor of Postville and surrounding areas who for over 60 years doctored the locals, delivered babies and made housecalls, with most people unaware that he was Jewish and those who did not caring.    This is certainly a book well worth reading, but it's best to read it as one man's personal odyssey distilled through his observations of a larger sociological moment, than as a work of anthropological or sociological objectivity or disinterest.  Of course, held to the latter standard it will fail, because that's not what the book ever set out to be 
 I just finished America: The Last Best Hope and I have to tell everyone that this is a terrific book.  I avoid long reviews that run on endlessly but I'm going to be even briefer on this one.    Bennett is a consumate writer.  He is best when he writes factually in an area he is passionate about.  American history is apparently one of those areas.  Like the Book of Virtues, America is written for the intelligent reader.  America delivers factual American history to an audience that may or may not be familiar with the background of their country.  As a public librarian I am sometimes alarmed and disheartened by what is and more importantly what isn't being taught in our schools.  I believe that if this is the only book on American history that people read than so-be-it.  It could be worse.  Bennett also manages to include areas that do not speak well of past decisions made by leaders of this country....but he does so without apology and without throwing the baby out with the bathwater so to speak.  This country has much to be proud of and its about time we shout it out....Bennett does this.  I'm looking forward to the next installment.  
 Amazon wants my review?  It's The White Album, fer crissake!  If you don't have it, get it.  Chances are you're replacing a well-loved, well-worn copy anyway 
 An exceptional resource. The suggestions for activities were found to be right on target. About.co 
 I am so pleased with this cookbook. All of the recipies in this book are  absoultely delicious. For anyone who loves southern food, this book is a  must have 
 Widely accepted as belonging to the upper-echelon of 20th century novels, The Heart of the Matter centers around the character of Major Henry Scobie. Scobie is an upstanding British policeman stationed somewhere in Africa (Sierra Leone?). There he resides with his wife Louise, a spoiled, soul-sucking dilettante. She proves to be a great foil for Scobie, who is revealed to be an insufferable milksop. It seems that the reason he is with Louise mostly has to do with his ardent Catholicism (see: masochism) and her uncanny ability to make his life abjectly miserable. Due mostly to his unflinching honesty in a world of corruption, Scobie has been passed over for a promotion that was deservedly his. Through a seemingly providential series of events, Scobie has his millstone of a wife shipped off and subsequently meets a young shipwreck survivor (think Lolita meets Heart of Darkness). For once in his cowardly life, Major Scobie allows himself to actually be happy and, for a brief period, finds solace in the arms of his new concubine. Alas, good things are not meant to last. Partly due to his own self-destructive tendencies and partly due to the machinations of the socially inept 'Wilson'(a sweaty poet/pervert who has designs on Louise), Scobie's world comes crashing down. He becomes indebted to Yusef, the Syrian black marketeer with a heart of gold, his wife suddenly decides to return, and he agonizes over cannabalizing his lord while not in a state of grace (see: transubstantiation). Greene introduces, unintentionally I think, his comic stylings into the latter part of the book. Scobie comes to regret the one honest thing he has done in his life and quickly destroys himself and everyone he holds dear. That is to say, he loses what little dignity he had and the reader can allow his/her self a quiet chuckle as his sorry excuse for a life comes crashing down. Laugh-out-loud funny 
 A friend recommended this DVD player after buying one, along with a new Hi Def TV.  I went and saw the picture quality, and decided I had to have a Hi Def TV and one of these DVD players.  The picture is nothing short of amazing.  Makes me want to watch all of my DVDs all over again!  One optical cable hookup to the 5.1 Sony receiver, and 1 HDMI cable to the HD TV, total piece of cake except for having to deal with the rat's nest of wires behind my entertainment stand. :)  Running in 720p mode, since my HD TV does native 720 but not 1080.  The remote control's buttons are well placed and easy to use in a dimly lit room, at least for me.  I totally agree with the other reviewers about the lame DVD tray, it's annoying to have to push the DVD up out of the tray from beneath through the center hole, makes removing a DVD one handed virtually impossible.  But overall, I'm absolutely satisfied with this DVD player, and would recommend it 
 North to Freedom is about a boy named David who escapes from a prison camp somewhere in southern Europe during WWII and travels all the way to Denmark. I liked the book because it is exciting, for example: When David runs away from some guards who want to capture him, his dog saves him. Another exciting moment is when he finds out why he needs to go to Denmark. This book taught me about trust, because David had to learn to trust people on his journey. I recommend this book for kids age 9 and up, and to be read aloud to kids 6 and up 
 I love these glasses and the price is great!  Too bad Mikasa has discontinued the original cheers line 
 Long having toyed with the idea of retiring in the south of France, my interest was piqued when friends told me about this book.  They were ready to lend me their copy, but seeing that this was a topic close to heart, i.e. the buying of a house in Southern Europe, I decided to go out and buy it.  Admittedly, the narrative started off slowly for me.  However, once Mayes started to recount the tale of actively looking for a house, and ultimately finding one, I was hooked.  Since I am a bit of food-lover, the recipes were of interest as well.  In all, I read the book in two sittings, it's that interesting once you get going.  If I could proffer some criticism, I would point out that the book has little insight for those hoping to find a true cultural observation.  The author and her boyfriend deal with the locals in various capacities, from notary to carpenter, but they befriend too few to really get at the heart of the real Tuscans.  Of course, given that friendships in Europe develop at glacier speeds this is normal.  Nonetheless, my hope is that all the years spent in Italy Mayes will be able to address this lacuna in her next book...the one I picked up today.  All in all, Under the Tuscan Sun is an eloquent, worth-while story about a fascinating part of the world 
 This book is a simple one that seeks to do no more than to introduce readers to the common varieties of freight cars found on the railways and it does a commendable job of doing that. After briefly discussing the origins of freight trains themselves, we are taken on a tour of the different types of cars. The development of each is examined and then their usage through the 19th and 20th centuries in the US is given. These are not in depth treatments but they are very adequate for an introduction 
 This is some of the best short fiction ever written. A friend of mine lent me this book. I've read a lot more J.G Ballard because I loved this book so much, but have not enjoyed Ballards other work as much.  Most of the stories deal with mans struggle to cope - with technolgy, with fear, with relationships with change etc.  There's a few dud stories but most are home runs 
 This book is truely an amazing work. It covers so so very much in history of Production and it covers not only whom, what, where but with all the microphones used, names of studios, artists and time, and what happened behind closed doors and why, and so very much more. I highly suggest this to anyone going into recording and into anyone with a love for music. It tells you all the things you want to know! 
            I bought this book when my cat Gareth dissapeared.It was very helpful to me as the author included prayers for lost, sick and abused animals in general.It makes for a good reference book and gives a few ideas how to get back your pet.It also contains cute stories about different animals. I got my pet back after loosing him for 9 days.So I highly recommend this book for any animal lovers 
 A looming 21-year High School reunion has led me to ponder the past, especially the town I grew up in. I have been reading The Geography of Nowhere by James Howard Kuntsler, a book which explores the rise of suburbia and automobile culture in America. Kuntsler explores the effects of modernist design philosophy (Le Corbusier, Gropius, Bauhaus etc. ) . Although Kunstler's book is by no means a complete history, his insights are provocative. His basic thesis is that the rise of the automobile has led to the development of a banal and meaningless "geography of nowhere". In other words, since the 1920s, Americans have pursued a single-minded vision when it comes to urban development: namely treating our built surroundings as disposable commodities to be bought and sold, with little regard to aesthetics.    Growing up in a suburb, I experienced this sort of fake-non-reality-bubble of what a city should be, or what it should do for its residents. There was always nothing to do, nowhere to go. Fortunately, in those days, creative people created their own "scene", no matter how lame it was. Such a naive scene based on our libertine tastes and overbearing ignorance. Of course, conformity was the rule.    And we all nearly s--t ourselves when we got behind the wheel of our first car. It was almost like and 5-year-old's first trip to Disneyland. It was like that first sexual experience. It was an epiphany, of sorts.    Little did we realize that our addiction to auto travel would bring such a high cost to our lonely empty souls. Who ever thought that being so cheap would cost us so much?  
 The book is a classy reproduction of the original with all of the wonderful N.C. Wyeth illustrations.  A great addition to any library with a piratical bent of mind 
 Eve and Roarke fans will love this selection!!!!  The last chapter had me holding my ribs in laughter!  As usual Eve works to exhaustion.  Although the mysteries, I agree with other posts, were transparent, it will not disappoint diehard fans!!!  This series continues to surprise me that it still has so much life left in it!  Bravo JD Robb 
 There never was a ballerina like her. I was lucky enough to see her dance many times in NYC in the late 70s. Whether she was dancing with Baryshnikov or with somebody else, she was just so good.  I've seen a lot of Nutcrackers, but no one's Clara comes close to hers.  Oh, yeah, Mischa's pretty good in this video :)  
 Season Five was a better ending to a show that was cancelled way before it's time. Originally cancelled at the end of the Fourth Season, the Fifth season was produced in good part because of the dedicated fans. Rumor has it that some started mailing their TV sets to the producers in protest! Power to the people! There are TV shows out there now that are similar, but none like the original. THIS IS A MUST SEE SERIES! La Femme Nikita ROCKS 
 Pink and Say, is a poignant and disturbing tale of two young Union soldiers, one black, called Pink, and one white, known as Say, whose life paths cross on a civil war battlefield. Pink finds Say in deep pain with a broken leg, and though wounded himself, somehow carries the boy home to his mother, Moe Moe Bay, who cares for Say as her own. While healing, the two boys become true friends, sharing memories and secrets: that Pink can read and hopes never to be "owned" again, and that Say, though a deserter, once shook Lincoln's hand at Bull Run. Neither had ever had such a close (amicable) encounter with someone of the `other' race, and for Pink especially this required great compassion. But their arrival had jeopardized dear Moe Moe's safety, and she is murdered by marauders as the boys lay hidden in the root cellar below. After laying her to rest, the grief stricken son and his demoralized companion soon fall into Confederate hands and are sent to Andersonville, the notorious prison camp. Say eventually recovers to tell the tale, but Pink never had a chance -- he was hung only hours after arriving.   The tale is told in Polacco's version of casual boy talk for that era, region and race, at times, perhaps stereotypical, as may be the portrayal of Say's "sweet Moe Moe". Simple emotive colored pencil and gouache sketches characteristic of Polacco's hand take over the pages in somber blues, grays and browns with spots of pattern and colorful detail, their immediacy providing more than half the tale. The story was handed down through several generations on Say's side to author Polacco, who dedicates her rendition to Pinkus Aylee, "because he has no living descendants to do this for him."  A parting plea, "when you read this...say [Pink's] name out loud and vow to remember him always,"asks readers to spread the word, preserve his memory and right the wrongs this terrible war was fought for.  Neither the picture book format nor heartwarming cover image of the two boys reading together hint at the mature content within. Part of an emerging genre of powerful picture stories for older readers, Pink and Say may be easily mistaken for a simple, happy tale of wartime friendship, which it is not. It is a page from our shameful past that begs to be read aloud and properly discussed. The universal friendship theme is intertwined with vivid insights into the horrors of war, racism and inequality, but also reveals a charitable spirit and a promise to keep the truth alive. 
 This is the book Lego Maniacs everywhere have been waiting for.  It has very good robots, complete parts lists, and easy to follow plans.  If you have been looking for additional building plans - now you have them 
 This book was a gift from the wonderful woman who taught me how to knit. I didn't even know what a treasure it was when I received it. I now teach (classes) myself, and I use this book in nearly every class, from beginning to advanced. And I have many dozens of knitting books.  June's diagrams are easy to follow, her advice worthwhile and practical. This is a tome of a book, and I sometimes like to just thumb through it to see what she has to say about a topic. There are no photos, just illustrations, and understandable, detailed instructions. The author is clearly analytical about knitting and compulsive about documentation.  It is unfortunate that June (or her publisher) doesn't re-release this book, as there is intense pent-up demand for it.  If it were readily available, I would certainly recommend this to everyone who knits and who would like to know more about knitting. I've knitted over 20 years now, and there is a great deal in this book that I still haven't tried.  If I were stranded on a desert island... you know how it goes... and I had yarn or fiber available as well, this is a book I'd want with me. 
 Aside from shipping dillemas thank you for getting me the book on time for class 
 I ran across this book in the campus bookstore when picking up some other  books for class. After glancing through it I was intrigued. Practical  advice, theory that was useful, models laid out so you could see how they  worked out on a day to day basis. I found myself taking notes and getting  ideas for things I could put into practice 
 A handy edition with superior type-setting for easy reading. All Christians should learn Greek and come to the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. This edition is easier to read than the parallel English-Greek editions I have seen. 
 I will try and keep this short. All of Charles Hapgood's books are seminal works. He remains one of the most original and brilliant thinkers of the 20th century. He was also a very fine writer. His work is constantly cited by others. But don't settle for secondary sources. Read and study everything Hapgood wrote. Start with his first book on crustal displacement, EARTH'S SHIFTING CRUST. Then read THE PATH OF THE POLE. And don't miss his MAPS OF THE ANCIENT SEA KINGS. Albert Einstein was convinced that Hapgood's theory of crustal displacement was correct. The fact that Hapgood couldn't explain the mechanism does not detract from his contribution; just as Newton's work on gravity is not diminished by his inability to explain what gravity actually is. Time will prove Hapgood correct on just about everything. Perhaps the mechanism for the crustal shifts will turn out to be a periodic earth rendezvous with a nemesis, a planet X, or a periodic close encounter with a comet ...we shall see! Enjoy 
 I bought this heater three weeks ago for my small room ( i was literally dying of cold)and i haven't regretted it one bit. It warms up very fast and the 360 degree function makes it heat up my entire room pretty quickly.The heater however emanates a 'heating smell' when its turned on, which you have to get used to.I strongly recommend this heater for anyone with a small room because of its safety features and performance 
 While this book is dense with valuable information - I like to call it Psyc. 601, and thus presumably not your first read in the field of psychotherapy - it resonates so clearly that anyone with a desire to grow should benefit greatly from it.  Indeed, while I am no expert, this book is the closest thing to the Holy Grail of psychology that I have read to-date because it provides a pretty unified understanding of the American male. I've bought five copies for friends.  Thanks Terrance 
 My daughters (4 & 10) wanted to do SOMETHING today... but baking cookies or sewing was too much hassle for ME.  They began digging in the DVD cabinet and found this movie unopened.  We popped it in the player and spent a wonderful afternoon together watching it.  The cinematography was beautiful, the actress playing Sara was just perfect and my girls sat upright watching every moment.  The brief scene with her father in war was a bit frightening - so they hid their heads.    They loved all the imaginative stories Sara told and they were disappointed when the movie ended because they wanted MORE. Funny that we have the movie "Annie" in the cabinet too - but I just can't sit through it with all the over-acting by the kids.  The Little Princess however was enjoyable even for mom.  My 10 year old would have loved this movie as a birthday gift.  She already said she wants to watch it again tomorrow 
 Ladies' Pages is an original and intriguing study of black women's magazines in the United States.  Much of the material in the book was new information for me.  For example, I was unaware of the rich history of African American and particularly African American women's magazines before Essence and Ebony.  I was also unaware that black males founded Essence and of the relationships between Essence and Latina magazine.  A strength of the book is that it provides insights into the migration experiences of African American women during the early twentieth century, an often overlooked topic.  Moreover, Rooks' examination of issues of respectability, sexuality, domesticity, and urbanization in early women's magazines provides an historical perspective that is useful for understanding African American women in contemporary popular culture.  While the book may have been enriched by more thorough examination of why particular magazines lasted as long as they did, by a less abrupt conclusion and by more analysis of O Magazine and the recent changes in Essence magazine, the book still was one of the most informative books I have read in a while 
 Matthew Maly has written a remarkable book that is indispensable for the understanding of Russia.  I am an American living in Ukraine, a country with a culture very similar to that of Russia, and so this book was especially relevant for me.  Maly has the advantage of having one foot on each side of what is a vast cultural and psychological divide, as he was born and raised in Russia, and educated after emigrating to America.  This makes him uniquely qualified to explain this part of the world in a language that the West can understand.  I would recommend this book not only to someone with an interest in Russia, but also to anyone who would like to understand that, elsewhere in the world, people don't just behave differently - they think differently - often in fundamental ways.  Maly explains these basic differences and the reasons behind them.  While Maly's thinking is well-disciplined, his writing style is friendly, fluid, and direct.  His candor jumps off the page at you.  It is not, thankfully, another history book; there are plenty of those, if you want them, but they won't explain Russia as it is - or the Russians as they are.  For me, this was not a "must read" book - it was a "must read twice" book 
 I'm pregnant with my first child, and this book did a very thorough job of explaining what to expect in the hospital, why they do the interventions they do, why these interventions might not necessarily lead to the most positive birth experience, etc.  I feel more prepared now for what that might come my way during labor, thanks to this book.  Anyone who claims that this book is 'unbiased', however, is sadly mistaken!  The overwhelming tone of the book is 'hospitals and doctors are evil and must be destroyed'.  I agree that the medical establishment intervenes too much in a natural process, but the bashing gets to be a bit much.  Also, I found that much of the book's assertions are based on studies from the 1960's and 1970's...I'd like to see something a little more current.  A lot can change in 30-40 years!!  I still recommend the book, but I wouldn't make it the ONLY childbirth book that you pick up 
 Fascinating, entertaining account of life on a man-of-war. Hilarious in parts; always subversive. Melville's mock glorification of the U.S. Navy and its officers is brilliant 
 The book was wonderful and the seller was fair and fast to ship  I am very pleased with this boo 
 Is an interesting book for who is in domaine. For the otherone could be inyeresting not at all 
 What a pity that this album wasn't recognized as the work of art that it is.  Granted the highlight of 'Masterpiece Theatre' is the aptly titled "Love Suite", however the rest of the album does not fail to deliver high quality, intricate vocals and funky beats.  This album is a classic and possibly one of the best albums in music history.  A bold statement?  Absolutely.  True?  Without a doubt.  'Masterpiece Theatre' was the first of it's kind, an album that tells a love story while fusing R&B with classical compositions.  One can easily look around and see either how this album had been used as a catalyst for other artists to go the same route; mixing the two genres or using the concept of telling a story through their album.  These other artists would later go on to sell millions in part because of the help from their record label.  This is album is possibly the one that showcases En Vogue's vocal abilities the best and reaffirms what set's En Vogue apart from other girl groups - past and present.  This album is a magnum opus!  Producers Foster/McElroy did a genius job of conveying the emotion of each song by using specific instruments and vocal arrangements, and directing them in a way that pulls the listener in and has them experience the emotional intensity of that song.  The album has humor, variety and harmony.  It's bold and very unique.  Had it had better backing from the record label, `Masterpiece Theatre' could have easily sailed into a snug place between platinum and multi-platinum status.   Due to the records label lack of marketing and promotion for this album, many who would have appreciated it overlooked it.  `Masterpiece Theatre' is daring, challenging, innovative, and intricate while remaining accessible to the masses.  R&B beats with Classical sonatas is hot!  It works, and it works well.  This album needs to be re-released on a new record label that is willing to put the marketing and promotion resources behind this jewel.  `Masterpiece Theatre' (specifically the "Love Suite") is a gem waiting to be discovered and should have the chance to be heard by a much larger and global audience.  It is still relevant, excitable and scorching even today - six years after it's release.  This is a must-have album!  Masterpiece indeed 
 its sooo good. yummy, filling, natural. what more could you ask for 
 It has a few to many interviews by people that made it big and not so big.  Some are interesting but mostly it takes away space for other good material.  The book also points to other good information and overall it is a great place to get started 
 After reaching late middle-age, I began to see a deterioration in the general health of myself and my friends.  Knowing our forebearers reached old age in reasonably good health, I started reading everything from medical reports to junk mail in an attempt to understand what is different in this day from the past.  One of the most revealing, and believable, reports I read is a book that is not really a book.  It is "Flax Oil as a True Aid Against Arthritis, Heart Infarction, Cancer and Other Diseases" by Dr. Johanna Budwig.  The book was not written as a book, but is the actual report she gave as a Nobel Prize winning researcher to her fellows in the medical field.  The facts she presented made complete sense, but did not list how the reader could utilize the information.  Hence, I ordered her book, "The Oil-Protein Diet Cookbook".  In it, she explains how the reader can put her theories of introducing flax oil to the diet in very interesting ways.  She has included over 500 simple recipes with which one can incorporate the beneficial flax oil into one's lifestyle.  The most helpful part is the recipes for a basic cream to replace the vegetable fat usually spread on our breads and melted over our veggies, and a very simple granola-type cereal one can use in many ways.  With these two items, the diet we are used to can easily be replaced with one that may be able to "fix" what is broken in our bodies.  She claims the faithful can completely cure such things as cancer, heart problems, and even diabetes.  In talking to folks older even than me, some fondly remember having their mothers make them ingest flax seeds in one form or another. Dr. Budwig claims flax seed products cannot possibly hurt, even if taken in large amounts.  I am listening to her and have begun to change my ways to hers.  She must know something, as she is well into her 90's and still active 
 Wanted to get this for my grandson as my husband and I have vision problems.  Great book 
 I loved this book!  It was such a fast read.  I can't wait to get another one 
 I saw this on tv and loved it, so i had to buy it 
 This book is absolute genius.The author,Dave Hemsath has put together a masterpiece.I can only hope he is busy writing another book.Keep up the GREAT WORK 
 I recently came across the title as cited by several different people as a book that was important in their life, and I'm grateful that I did. It encompasses all of the ideas expressed in many other books of its type, however it doesn't leave anything out, while addressing each topic in a succinct way. It is not new, and a few of the examples given will be dated. That doesn't lessen it's messages in anyway. 
 Classic Tim Burton, Micheal Keaton at his best, and the movie that introduced me to Winona Ryder. I love it.  I wish I knew what the impetus was for this twisted take on the afterlife.  It was hilarious when I was 10 and 17 years later I still thoroughly enjoy it.  
 I bought this book with Even More Baby Quilts just to check it out, turns out that I loved it. The quilts are very easy to put together and fun to look at. The color pictures are very helpful, this book is easy to understand and great for the beginner or the expert!! Take my word for it 
 No one would argue that this thriller is great literature.  But if you are looking for something good to read on the beach or a long airplane flight, this is just the ticket (so to speak).   Patterson's plot draws you in, irrespective of the justifiable complaints by some other reviewers of its predictability.  It's true that there are a lot of handy coincidences that put the heroine in the right place at the right time, but so what?  It's entertaining.  There are a couple of good, unanticipated plot twists that liven up the narrative, plus enough action to move things right along and keep readers interested.    If you're looking for an easy read that does not present an embarassment to carry around in public, this is it.  
 Nice to see Sharpe again.  Didn't think the story line was as good as the earlier Sharpe episodes.  
 If you were only able to buy one J2EE book, then this would be it. J2EE is a complex technology filled with opportunities to make judgment errors. This book clearly outlines the rationale and implications of J2EE decisions to avoid making those costly mistakes. The information in this book could be the difference between a success and a failure. I highly recommend this book 
 I read a lot of books about gay guys, girls, ect. but never have I picked up one that touched so well on the subject of homophobia.  It's a simple enough story to read, compared to some other gay authors but it touches extremely well on problems that one can encounter growing up, first with weight, then intelligence, then being gay.  I couldn't put it down after the first chapter 
 In all the books i've read in my life... this book is by far the best. Filled with wickedly fun and irreverent information that is both useless and needed. Get the book, read it, and try not to spout off all the new useless stuff you've learned, i dare ya 
 This is such a wonderful movie.  I loved this version with Keira Knightley.  There was such wonderful chemistry with the actors...all of them that it became my favorite version 
 I first came accross the principle of Energy Density as I was reading a book by Rick Gallup called "The GI (Glycemic Index) Diet". In it he mentioned a food pyramid by the Mayo Clinic which ranked food groups according to energy density. He also said that the best way to apply it was to divide our plate into three sections. Fill half the plate with low carbohydrate vegetables, one quarter of the plate with a dense carbohydrate serving, and one quarter of the plate with a protein selection. I have followed this principle for a number of years and as a result have lost nearly 80 pounds.  Barbara Rolls, the author of this book, did some of the original research on Energy Density for Penn State. Her books tell how to calculate the energy density of a food. Take the calories in the serving and divide by the grams. This gives the calories per gram. An alternative is to divide the calories by the ounces in the serving size. This gives the calories per ounce. Using this technique it is easy to determine the energy density of a food as both the calories and the grams are posted on every food level. For natural foods, they calories and grams can be looked up on the USDA Nutrient Data Base at [...].  Energy Density is one of the most important principles in weight management. By selecting the right foods we can increase the volume of food that we eat while at the same time lowering calories 
 "Tightrope" was a lifeline as our 350 member church approached the launch of our small groups ministry after 18 months of intense study and preparation. It artfully provides the reality that every aspect of small group life involves competing worthy goals ie: caring vs Bible knowledge. Which deserves more time? How to decide? Have I even considered the goal opposite the one to which I'm dedicated? Are you even aware of the 12 goals? They are intuitive once you've read about them. The opposing goals are the anchors of each 'tightrope' and we leaders determine how close to or how far from each extreme we are. AND the balance point shifts depending on the group life at that heartbeat. Wow. A new leader, convinced she could not possibly BE a leader, read "Tightrope" and said, "Oh. Now I get it. I can do this!" Truly, this book can make an 'Ah Ha!' difference in small group stewardship. Again, thank you, Willow. 
 This book is very fun and educational too!  It has topics about farts, toe cheese, sneezing and other gross stuff.  I learned alot from this book.  For example when I wanted to stop a sneeze, I used to hold my nose.  Then I learned how bad that was for you.  Now I put my finger under my nose to stop a sneeze.  I absolutly loved this book!  You should buy it!  It is a great book for anyone who likes gross stuff.  Now, I'm a girl and not very interested in gross stuff, but this book is a exeption 
 A fascinating read.  I never knew how taxes played such a large affect on marriages and on working women.  After reading this book, I suddenly understood that some of the root causes of the economic dilemmas for working mothers are actually caused by our tax system.  McCaffery is right--we need change, and this book explains why 
 Break out the Calgon and take yourself away with Angel with Attitude, especially if you've just had a bad day, because you will definitely be turning that frown upside down.  This is escapism at its best with a sympathetic hero and heroine, with believable weaknesses and even better strengths, butterfly in your tummy sexual tension, quirky characters, plot twists and Ms. Rowen's talent for creating witty dialogue. 
 I have a pretty healthy diet already but this book was a great education for me and I feel like gave me the down and dirty, nuts and bolts of really effective eating. I felt terrific on this plan, great energy, I lost weight in my stomach and thighs but my mental healthy was the most dramatically improved. I just felt better over all eating this way. Living with less salt made me taste my food and it also helped me realize that those food cravings I get don't mean I'm some pyscho compulsive eater but that it is a chemistry thing. That felt good to know too! This book gave me some much needed information and I refer to it often. 
 The Perks of being a Wallflower made me feel both happy and sad at the same time. 
 This book was given to me to read to my granddaughter after my special cat passed away.  My 7 year old granddaughter asked if cats go to heaven.  This story shows all the love that this cat has given and the only logical conclusion is that they do go to heaven. 
 Ranks among Pat Metheny's very best.  I would recommend AMERICAN GARAGE to almost anyone who wants to get a taste of jazz as it came out of the "lost years" of the 1970's.  There are some sounds among these pieces that would become a part of the "smooth jazz" movement as it would become known in the 1990's; but there is nothing to fear about for being accused of being "light weight" or "diluted" that drew the wrath of jazz heads toward the endless parade of phonies that so many felt "stole" attention and record purchases away from real jazz.    Far from dreary, AMERICAN GARAGE sings of joy and provides much to interest upon repeated listening.  Metheny would go on to be a small jazz industry in himself in succeeding years and his musical vocabulary would expand--sometimes not for the better.  Nevertheless, this is the perfect marriage of electric guitar and keyboards many still seek today.  Only five cuts; but pleasing and intelligent all the same. 
 "Killer Insight" is the latest in the Psychic Eye Mysteries.  This book is the best of the lot.  Be warned that you will not want to put this book down.  My "insight" tells me that there will be more in this series and I can hardly wait 
 This book had been on my "to read" list for some time--fairly low, because travelogues are not usually my cup of tea.  But after seeing the very excellent interview with the engaging Mr. Least Heat-Moon on BookTV last weekend, it hurtled to the top.  Having just finished it, I can do nothing but give the author props for a very funny, insightful (and at times, even moving) chronicle of modern America, as seen from the backroads.    What is most astonishing about this book is that every observation, every encounter, every description rings honest.  Any number of writers could have tackled this assignment, using it as an opportunity for silly or sentimental navel-gazing.  Mr. LH-M keeps it real.  He lets the people speak for themselves.  He provides enough details about his own life and personal crises to establish himself as an interesting (and interested) narrator, but he never loses sight of the country around him.  He provides vivid descriptions of the ever-changing scenery but does not get bogged down in adjective-overdrive.  Those he interviews are a fascinating mix of the poor and middle and upper-middle class:  thinkers and philosophers and laborers and "just plain folks" who live in places most of us will never visit.  Though Mr. LH-M is a restless wanderer and does not remain in any locale long, he does not miss interesting side-opportunities that present themselves.  He learns about hang-gliding in Washington, syruping in New Hampshire, joins a fishing crew for a day off the coast of Maine, and along the way hears tales of small-town America and of the gradual movement (which has grown only faster in the last 25 years) towards sweeping most of America into the net of suburban sprawl.  This book provides good evidence why the trend should be resisted.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  Calling it a "travelogue" is an injustice in many ways, because it fails to capture the deeply human aspect of the author's chronicle.  Buy and read this book.  You will be glad you did 
 "Tracy" and "Sugar Sugar" are both songs sung by Ron Dante, lead singer of The Archies.  These are two really fun songs.  The rest on the set are okay as well.  I recently discovered that Ron Dante has a website: www.rondante.com  Ron Dante has a new CD out for 2004 called "Saturday Night Blast" that I also enjoy.  It's a great way to keep up with these artists 
 Breger gives us a more vivid picture of Freud as a person, including his daily routines and personal relationships, and how he constructed a mythology of his own life and then universalized  this myth as psychological bedrock for humanity in the form of the oedipal theory. The idea in the oedipus complex that the little boy looks up to an overpowering father with whom he also engages in murderous competitive rivalry - at least in fantasy- in fact denied the reality of Freud's relationship with his father, who he loved but saw as weak and ineffective. The oedipal rival actually represented Freud's wish for a stronger, more potent father. This is one essential insight in a book that puts Freud in three dimensional historical space, in a way that previous historians failed to- who either put him on a pedestal, or else tended to bash him. Breger does neither, and lets us see  him as a great thinker with huge blindspots and incapacities for tolerating other points of view, which has left a bitter legacy within psychoanalysis. Breger is a lucid and moving writer, as is also evidenced in his previous, also profound, biography of Dostoevsky 
 For substance  "The Crusader" falls within the work of David Brinkley,  Robert Caro and David McCullough. History which is fun to read but isn't fluff.   Not the very light writing of a Sean Hannity, Al Franken, Michael Savage or Bill O'Reilly. Nor an Ann Coulter foot-noted polemic intended to amuse or infuriate.  On the other hand, "The Crusader" is not as detailed as  Yale university's Annals of Communism series (Think Sean McMeekin, Donald Rayfield and William J. Chase--wonderful history but not books one picks up and reads straight through).   Of the 432 pages in "The Crusader" 79  are footnotes. 12 pages mention Ted Kennedy. 4 pages out of those 12 pages are in the appendix--the KGB letter. Kengor received the Chebrikov document via Marko Suprun, Walter Zaryckyi and Herb Romerstein (author of the Venona papers). A brief excerpt from the letter was first published in the London Sunday Times (February 2, 1992 "Teddy, the KGB and the Top Secret File").  
 The major advantage of this translation is it is a large collection. Other unexpurgated translations only have about half. I also appreciate Gibbs' readable style and her arrangement of the fables into subject matter. I knocked off one star mainly because these are not the best stories I've read, but they are interesting in a certain way 
 Tina Dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case, which encompasses motherhood, mental illness, child abuse, and matricide. Dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing, rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion. That, in and of itself is impressive, because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other,get caught up in emotion, and appear unable to really present all sides of the story. Lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention. It is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them, but also tragically failed their mother. 
 The best thing about this book is the sense of awe that Dr. Silk brings to his explanation of the cosmos. I do not see how anyone can look at the truly amazing discoveries, pictures, and happenings that have been announced in recent years without standing in awe. And this awe comes through on virtually every page. Combine this with the clear writing style, no math, and you have quite a book.   Another aspect of the book that comes through strongly is just how completely Einstein's General Theory of Relativity underlies our present understanding of the cosmos. Today ninety years later the experimental physicists and cosmologists are still discovering proof of various aspects of Einstein's theory. In this book these discoveries are discussed, and where needed credit to Einstein is given.   Quite often with such books as these, I'd really like to meet with the author over a pint of beer and ask him a few questions. There are a few points like string theory, branes, speed of the effect of gravity where it seems that the most recent theories and experiments are raising questions on the cut and fast answers that Dr. Silk gives.   These points are minor when compared to the overall excellence of the book but remember that our understanding of the cosmos is constantly changing. Every discovery brings more questions 
 So often when looking through magazines I haven't found quite what I was looking for in the Christian literature.  I like the approach Christianity Today takes.  It has articles that are broad, and not focused on a specific demonination.  I believe the magazine has a slight evangelical bent to it.   I do like the variety of articles, and coverage of current events.  I would recommend this magazine for those who want to become a little more informed of Christianity in the modern world 
 I love the ninja book the best because they helped Jack and Annie cross the icy water.   I'm 6 years old and these are the first chapter books i've read.   My Mom even likes them.    I love all of the books.  
 Shipler's book is an eye opener.  We in the US tend to think of ourselves as a wealthy nation, which we are, and that we all share in that wealth (or at least have an equal chance at becoming wealthy).  Maybe at some point in our history that might have been true, but it is far from true now.  We have institutionalize so many economic barriers, that some of our citizens can never escape the poverty trap.  This book gives readers the most important tool in finding the solution to poverty--AWARENESS.  We need to look beyond our small corners of the country and of society and take steps to tear down the barriers. 
 This is the second year that I have used this book.  It was provided by the Preschool I previously worked for and I liked and used it so much that I purchased it myself for use in my new job.  This is a wonderful resource book to use with 3 and 4 year old particularly but it has materials useful for ages 2 thru 5.  This is truly a CREATIVE resourse book in that you can tailor the contents of each unit to meet the developmental needs of your students.  I especially like the extensive reading material list with each theme, there are books for all ages of preschoolers 
 Widely accepted as belonging to the upper-echelon of 20th century novels, The Heart of the Matter centers around the character of Major Henry Scobie. Scobie is an upstanding British policeman stationed somewhere in Africa (Sierra Leone?). There he resides with his wife Louise, a spoiled, soul-sucking dilettante. She proves to be a great foil for Scobie, who is revealed to be an insufferable milksop. It seems that the reason he is with Louise mostly has to do with his ardent Catholicism (see: masochism) and her uncanny ability to make his life abjectly miserable. Due mostly to his unflinching honesty in a world of corruption, Scobie has been passed over for a promotion that was deservedly his. Through a seemingly providential series of events, Scobie has his millstone of a wife shipped off and subsequently meets a young shipwreck survivor (think Lolita meets Heart of Darkness). For once in his cowardly life, Major Scobie allows himself to actually be happy and, for a brief period, finds solace in the arms of his new concubine. Alas, good things are not meant to last. Partly due to his own self-destructive tendencies and partly due to the machinations of the socially inept 'Wilson'(a sweaty poet/pervert who has designs on Louise), Scobie's world comes crashing down. He becomes indebted to Yusef, the Syrian black marketeer with a heart of gold, his wife suddenly decides to return, and he agonizes over cannabalizing his lord while not in a state of grace (see: transubstantiation). Greene introduces, unintentionally I think, his comic stylings into the latter part of the book. Scobie comes to regret the one honest thing he has done in his life and quickly destroys himself and everyone he holds dear. That is to say, he loses what little dignity he had and the reader can allow his/her self a quiet chuckle as his sorry excuse for a life comes crashing down. Laugh-out-loud funny 
 I just finished this book a day ago and it is definitely a worthy sequel to Kiss Me, Judas.   Following the story in Kiss Me, Judas Phineas Poe returns to Denver where it all begins and finds himself in a completely different world. People are playing a game called the 'game of tungues' which is slowly becoming real and reality is starting to slip.  This book is extremely different from Kiss me, Judas but not in a negative way at all. It mixes the noir genre from KMJ with sci-fi to create a great vibe and an incredible story. This book honestly had me on end until the last page.  I strongly recommend this book to any fans of: Will Christopher Baer, Chuck Palahniuk, Bret easton Ellis, Craig Clevenger, and any other author out there 
 Loves the books and characters and this series just kepps getting bette 
 I read the first part of "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" with great enjoyment and excitement. Finally, someone found a way to write about philosophy in a way that makes it interesting and accessible to the average reader... quite an achievement. But it was too good to last.  In the second part Pirsig begins to talk about 'quality' and the whole book disintegrates -- because while Pirsig has a genius for explaining the ideas of the great philosophers, his own contribution to the field is less than adequate. 'Quality' as an absolute concept, an objective measurement, a new dimension? C'mon, give us a break! 'Quality' is as culturally-bound, subjective, nebulous as you can get. You have to be a very insular American to think otherwise.  The third part of the book, Pirsig's adventures in academia, reads like the diary of a crank. Apparently Pirsig's ideas did not find much favor in the harsh, skeptical light of the universities, so he took them directly to the masses in the form of this book. Well, good luck to him. 
 The score was complete and arrived within a few days of ordering. It was written clearly and I was able to accomplish the task I wanted without any trouble. It included both vocal soloists and choral parts so that the choir would be able to manage it easily. I was very pleased with my purchase 
 This is certainly my favorite book of the entire series. One of the things that I love about this series is that the author doesn't pull his punches when it comes to dealing blows to the main character. And this book shows that more than any other! This book had me in tears more than a few times. A truely excellent read, and one I had trouble putting down! 
 I bought this book after hearing a radio talk show review of it. It is not the normal book that I buy. I thought it would be dry. IT'S NOT. It was the scariest book I have ever read, and one of the best. Having served in the military, I was horrified by the way that the Clintons' treated the military. He had a job he didn't do and she should have kept her mouth shut. This book is worth reading more than once and once you start the first time, it is hard to put it down. My first thought when I turned the last page, was "My God!"  I think it is a required reading for anyone who votes in our next presidential election. It confirms my thought that you should have to serve in the military before running for president 
 The ice cubes come out intact - not chipped or cracked.  To get them out, push each cube from the bottom with your finger.   For fastest and easiest results, wait for 5 minutes after taking the tray out of the freezer. This way, the ice cubes will pop right out. If you don't wait, your fingertip will be freezing while trying to push them out 
 This book is very uplifting and an enlightening read no matter what type of woman you are.  One of the best qualities is the author's ability to present the strengths of each archetype and not build a hierarchy of goddesses.  This approach allows the reader to understand different women, as well as conflicting emotions within herself, and see the positive qualities.  I found myself completely taken by her discussion of the Hestia archetype.  In fact, I did some further research on this archetype and now have a collection of notes to pull from.  If a book inspires further investigation, it is definitely worth the read 
 I also own Tao of Peace, another album by the same artists, and this one takes off where the other left off. The same beautiful flute and Guqin blend to create a soothing, and exotic mix. Perfect for massage, meditation, or yoga 
 This is a wonderful example of a professional and high quality musical product for children. The authenticity of the narration has not been compromised and the musicians are the best in their field. When there is so much manufactured aural pulp out there aimed at our children it is a pleasure to find a CD that both engages a childs imagination and teaches them about musicianship at the same time. I have 1 and 4 year old girls and a 3 year old boy who all adore the music and connect with the story 
 As another reviewer has pointed out, it's difficult to write a review for a book that is a reference book. But oh, what a reference book this is. If you do any web design work, you need this book. It covers virtually everything a web designer needs to know/or to be able to refer to. Among the topics Robbins covers are XHTML, CSS, web design standards, also mentions XHTML 1.1, DOM, JavaScript and so forth. While some topics are given a brief mention, that's only because a full description of some of them (like DOM) would take a book of their own.  Part 1 (the Web Environment) takes on topics like designing for different browsers (which can be a challenge with all the different web browsers and versions around), "A beginner's guide to the server," which explains basic web server topics, and internationalization.  Then it's on to The Structural Layer of XML & XHTML in Part 2. It starts off with an intro to XML and then into a HTML & XHTML overview. I liked how Robbins took the time to explain XHTML 1.1 and various new and upcoming standards, it's one of the reasons why I got this book. As a part time web designer, I want to keep up on the latest trends and make sure my web sites are up to date and will appear as they should on both newer and older browsers. There's also sections that explain text elements, images and objects, tables, frames (even if frames are "frowned upon" nowadays).  Part 3 is devoted to Cascading Style Sheets, some ten chapters worth. This I feel is a very good thing, since they've become a vital part of web design.  Subsequent sections of the book touch on JavaScript, DOM, Web Graphics, even Web audio and video.  If you don't have this book you need to get it, it's that's comprehensive a reference 
 My husband thinks this is the best invention and the price is great.  I buy several at time and they each last for several months 
 Another of my favourite films, A wonderful love story, my only fault is that they cast older actors to play the parts of young men and women. That aside it is a wonderful film and I personally like it as the wedding hymn is the one sung at my own wedding 
 While Eve Dallas and her partner Peabody are interviewing a witness at the Wilfred B. Icove Center for Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgery, the body of Dr. Wilfred B. Icove, Sr. is discovered. Due to the way Icove was murdered, Eve suspects a professional hit by the last person to come in contact with Dr. Icove, a mysterious young woman. As Eve investigates, she begins to suspect that there is something off about Dr. Icove's practice, and when his son is found murdered in the same manner as the father, Eve delves deeper into the doctors' pasts. What she discovers not only sickens but shocks Eve, who, with the help of her husband, Roarke, intends to put a stop to a secretive illegal, immoral, and unethical scientific experiment that involves cloning.   J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts has written an engaging thriller here about a subject that is presently being debated among the scientific community and which, due to DNA advancements, may very well come to pass. Eve's edgy manner of dealing with people, balanced by Roarke's understanding and love and Peabody's perky demeanor, continue to bring freshness to a well-grounded series.    
 This bag is simply amazing!  I go to the gym 4 times per week and often go directly from work so I needed a bag that would hold everything I needed to workout and clean-up afterwards.  The Ogio Locker Bag does it all:  it's got a special compartment for my gym shoes and a shelf to separate them from my towel and workout gear.  It fits perfectly in just about any gym's locker (I go to Bally's) and with its front-opening door, you can access everything you need while your bag is IN the locker! I love the fact that it comes with containers for my toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and also with a comb, brush, and mirror. To top it off, it's light-weight, sturdy, and even comes with a built-in vent so that your wet/sweaty clothes don't get too ripe! LOL! : )  I couldn't be happier with my purchase!  GET THIS BAG!! You won't be disappointed 
 the genius of this group is that they take a world sound and make it uniquely mexican in an infinitude of ways.  and if you listen to "chilanga banda" you'll learn a whole new vocabulario que ni  parece a espanol, porque no es. es el son de la calle chilanga.  no te lo  pierdas 
 This Franklin puzzle solver is easy to use. I love having the sturdy cover. This hand held is not too big like some of their other models and not too small like their original model. The back lighting is much improved and it is a pleasure to use. Franklin makes terrific, long-lasting products and this one is no exception 
 This is one of the best albums of any type of music that I have ever heard. I could listen to this all day. The first time I played it I thought, this is pretty good, but each time I played it I liked it more and more. This is great in the car, as background music or through the headphones. This music is clean, the instruments are distinct and the melody line is interesting. Overall the album is on the mellow side but this ain't lite-FM this is surf guitar 
 I was first turned onto this book when I raided my sister's bookshelf.   She is just as avid a reader as me and I go over her house to get reading  material whenever I have run through all of my own.  Now I own a copy of  this book myself.  I just had to have it.  No book has come closer to  evaluating my real life.  If the things in one chapter didn't happen to me,  then they have certainly happened to someone I know.  I think this book  should be required reading for all women, no matter what their age or race.   It helps put a method to the madness of our daily lives and the things we  endure in relationships 
 THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST NOVELAS I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS I WAS UP UNTIL 5AM 
 It was amazing to read that many of the ideas and ideals around the turn of the twentieth century are still used today.  Ford goes into great detail describing the origination of the Ford motor company, the labor force, the assembly line, and financial situations of the company.  At a time when most of the male workers across the country were working for fifty cents a day, Ford incorporated a minimum wage of from three to five dollars a day.  Henry Ford did a good job writing this book as well.  There were several examples of sage advice include which are quoted by speakers and writers to this day.  He was truly a visionary, business minded genius.  The world was certainly improved by his presence.  I'm looking forward to reading other of his works in the future 
 Always think twice. Never jump to hasty conclusions without considering ALL the effects of an act or decision. That's the essence of Economics: "looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy."   Most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson, as Henry Hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book. Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.  Beyond what you may think about the government's role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author's liberal views, "Economics in One Lesson" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.  As the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and 'rogue' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action). Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do. BTW, "Economics in One Lesson" might be a good place to start.. 
 Beautifully illustrated story that moves the soul.  This book fills your heart with joy.  It's not only for sick children but any child that is enduring a difficult time in his or her life, like the sickness of a sibling, freind, parent or close one.  I highly recommned this book to anyone that is able to read or is able to be read to, while experiencing the uncertainty of being ill 
 Yes girls like John Deere! My 2 y/o daughter is a very girly girl and she loves watching these movies with her twin brother and older brother.   As a Mom, I appreciate that it's interesting to watch (not annoying) it's fast paced, sometimes silly, has plenty of easy to remember songs and best of all, it shows kids not much older than mine having fun with John Deere 
 After searching extensively for my best option regarding a portable hard drive, I chose Seagate for their reputation and my previous experience with their products, but also for the drive's specs.  Installation was pretty straight forward, with no issues at all.  I'll continue shopping Seagate 
 Control Machete is very fast becoming one of my favorite groups.  I do not consider myself a hip-hop fan, nor do I speak very much Spanish.  I was introduced to them through Spike Jones' commercial and their single "Si Senor."  I had no idea that the rest of their music was even less repetive and so much more creative.  If you understand even a little Spanish, you will realize how much deeper than typical American music they allow their lyrics to be.  Their "Control Machete" song is a fun one that lets you believe you are listening to them live in concert somewhere, but creatively intertwines Mexican melodies and keeps it pretty fresh.  Cheve is also very fun, and almost a Mexican rendition that will remind you of the skill of groups like the Sugar Hill gang back in the day.  Sure, some of their melodies and their lyrics are a little unpolished in this album, but the rough edges make it a lot of fun.  "Justo 'N" and "Andamos Armados" have a depth you don't need to understand a lot of Spanish to appreciate.  Humanos Mexicanos and Mexican Curios are also absolutely brilliant singles that prove that Control Machete could not be neatly defined as a "rap" or "hip-hop" group.  They do not fit into the mold of American or Mexican music and are some of the most creative musicians in the business today.  If you've enjoyed previous singals by the group today is the day to take the leap and buy an album.  I did and the investment was well worth it 
 Michael Crichton is known by most, and reviled by some, as an ardent crusader warning of the excesses of unrestrained science; a skeptic of the contemporary juggernaut---global warming. In this book, Crichton eschews science to whip up a fictional adaptation of the crime of a century: The Great Train Robbery. This book details the genesis to the execution of this daring theft by Edward Pierce, the socialite and criminal: from Pierce's hiring of the best criminal minds to the long periods of observation. All this done on a background which showed the ever-widening chasm between haves and haves-not. Crichton's writing is short and precise, with most chapters hardly running over fives pages. This works well as the novel moves along individual events. The milieu of the times also provides for a greater appreciation of the act, as does his penchant to fast forward from the story to the future. Even though there weren't many explicit passages on science, his description of Bernoulli's Law was simple and accurate. Science has really advanced since those times. The Robbery suffers from some flaws. It lacks strong characters to back up Pierce. Miriam and Mr. Harranby, two people essential to the story, are virtually nonexistent. Also, the trial pales in comparison to the rest of the book. Pierce's nonchalance irritates, while the Houdini act at the end is hard to swallow. Finally, while I agree that crime might indeed pay and that most criminals are of superior intelligence, I believe Crichton undermines his point that poverty is not a source of crime. Focussing on the blue collar crime which this robbery was, we see that all of Pierce's partners were from the lower echelon of society. What does that say of his thesis?  But by far this is a wonderful read. Pick up the Great Train Robbery and have your attention stolen 
 Peter Galison presents an in-depth look at Experimental Physics in the 20th century, both to reveal its history and present an alternative view of scientific change in recent history.  Starting with Wilson's first cloud chamber and progressing through WWII R&D up to and including the Superconducting SuperCollider Galison reveals major changes and redefinitions of what it means to be a practitioner of Experimental Physics.  His approach applies a sociological perspective where theorists, experimentalists and instrumentalists share a dialog referred to by Galison as a "trading zone" where the previously assumed communication structures within and between Scientific disciplines are viewed as non-rigid, flexible and mutable.  Along the way Galison provides fascinating examples of events and discoveries that illuminate the little known world of research and experiment in recent history.  Among these examples are the fire at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator which brought about much greater regulatory involvement of the AEC. Also, the necessary use of MonteCarlo methods in the development of the H-Bomb where as Galison states "A hundred million degrees kelvin put the laboratory out of the picture..." ultimately leading to present day computer technology.  For anyone within or outside of physics proper this book is truly an eye-opener to that almost invisible world of 20th century Experimental Physics 
 This film is astounding. Robin Williams' performance as a world-weary academic and therapist is one of the most brilliant portrayals ever committed to film. Matt Damon is unbelievably effective as a math genius born to poverty in South Boston who is attempting to cope with his gift and maintain a normal life. Great script and great direction. I would put this film on a list of the 50 greatest films of all time. You must see Good Will Hunting 
 I have thick, wavy hair that falls below my shoulders.  It's layered, with the shortest layer to my chin.  I also have a few fringes that fall at eye level.  This flat iron is better than the 2" Conair that I had for years that finally died.  I would agree that it seems a wider iron would work faster but it really doesn't, nor does it work ay better.  In fact I think this one works better than the wider one.  It doesn't dry my hair out as much (if you think about how much time your hair spends exposed to the heat on each width plate, it makes sense) I also find it's easier to make the flips with the 1". It gets the short pieces just as nicely as the longer pieces. It heats up quickly and I do just fine on 15.  The comb attachment is a waste of time in my opinion, mostly due to its tangling capabilities. I love that it has a lock on it and it's very light; makes it great for traveling.  I hope this helps 
 THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE BEST CDS EVER. I HAVE THE OTHER TWO FROM AMAZON.COM AND THERE ALL GOOD. OF COURSE I AM MODEST BECAUSE HE IS MY COUSIN. BUT IF HE WASNT I STILL WOULD BUY ALL OF THEM BECAUSE OF HIS FANTASTIC VOICE AND THE SONGS TOUCH YOU ALOT. GREAT JOB PAUL YOUR THE VERY BEST. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TWO TO TANGO AND THERES ANOTHER SONG THAT HE DID A MOVIE FOR CANT THINK OF THE MOVIE AND ALSO DO A CD WITH THAT SONG AND ONE WITH ORIENTAL EYES THATS A GOOD SONG TO. I HOPE SOON HE COMES OUT WITH ANOTHER CD WITH THOSES SONGS ON IT. ILL KEEP LOOKING ON HERE FOR ANYMORE CDS BY HIM 
 This series has always been well received but I felt in the last few offerings it had gone a bit far afield. This book brings Vlad back to the empire and begins to weave together all those lose ends. I can't wait for the next novel 
 I read this book in 8th grade, its one of my favorites. Its should become as great of a book as Cather in the Rye, or the Great Gatsby. I just love  this book, and it will be one of my favorite forever 
 If you love country music, your collection will be bare without some Alan Jackson in it! 
 The book opens with both Beatrice's illegitimate children living together as cousins. John MacAndrew is away trying to get his fortune back after Beatrice stole it all in an effort to keep Wideacre for her children. Julia and Richard early on seem to represent the good and bad Beatrice. Julia resembles Beatrice, and she has her excellent horse riding skills, plus the ability to farm and work the land. All those were "the good Beatrice." Richard only has the insatiable hunger to keep Wideacre for himself and pass it on to his heir. He doesn't care about anything or anybody else. This represents "the bad Beatrice." At the end of Wideacre all Beatrice could think about was raising enough money to secure Wideacre for her heirs, and she turned a blind eye to the poverty and sickness that she was causing. I like how Philippa Gregory weaves historical facts into the story, such as how the poor had to live in order to survive, and how the landowners made such unfair laws, and how they controlled the courts. The parts of the book that were really aggravating to me were the ones where Julia had absolutely no backbone whatsoever.... especially after Richard rapes her. I think Celia and John would definitely have believed her, not Richard.  I have really liked every Philippa Gregory book, whether from the Other Boleyn Girl series or the Wideacre series. I'm looking forward to reading the last book, Meridon.  
 "Hound of the Baskervilles" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.  But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of "memoir" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.  Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.  But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.  "Hound of the Baskervilles" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.   The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real "hound" is uncovered.  Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.  "Hound of the Baskervilles" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book. Solid work, and a good introduction to the Holmes series 
 Some times out of the blue, something comes into your life just at the right moment.  This book is one of those things.  It opens the door to bring back the magic in life.  The information and the philosophy are provided to us and it is up to us whether we apply this knowledge to our lives or not.  It is a wonderful book and a gift from the universe that I will treasure the rest of my days.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book especially for those desiring to make their daily lives more than just the mundane grind 
 John Q. Public is a perfect example of why Amazon should screen "customer" reviews.  It's quite obvious that he never watched this documentary; if he thought EC comics and the HBO "Tales from the Crypt" series were "second rate," then why did he buy and watch this DVD in the first place? It is equally obvious from his other reviews that the sole purpose of his existence is to bash others (apparently he has it in for comic books - perhaps he had a traumatic experience reading Donald Duck as a kid).  As the editorial reviews attest, this documentary is hardly "cheaply done."  Rather than "giving comics a bad name," this show shines a spotlight one of the most influential comic book companies of all time, and examines the controversy over horror comic books in the 1950s.  Like the EC Comics themselves, this documentary is visually innovative, using vibrant montages and spectacular visual effects to highlight the original comic artwork.  It is an exceptional program and highly recommended for fans of the original comic books, the later HBO television series, pop culture or even history buffs 
 The authors provide a good, practical introduction to the world of blogging, though some of the information is not as deep as this reader would have preferred. Also, I was put off by too many "self examples" from their own blogs, rather than third-party case studies which would have been seen as less self promoting. However, would definitely recommend this as a good guide, particularly for small, medium enterprises and sole proprietors 
 Finding the Dream is the third and final book in what has become known as the Dream Trilogy. This series follows the lives of three childhood friends, each very different from the others - different ideals and different backgrounds. The common tie is that they were all raised in the same mansion near Monterey, California.  Finding the Dream focuses on Laura Templeton, daughter of a wealthy hotel magnate. Laura has grown up in a life of luxury, having any and all amenities available to her. Her dreams have always been simple - she wants a happy marriage and happy, healthy children. When she turns 18, she thinks her dreams are soon to be fulfilled when Peter, an assistant manager at one of her father's hotels, proposes. The bliss is short-lived when Peter's true colors emerge - all he wants is a boost in his career. He doesn't really want a wife and children and feels they're only something that must be endured to reach his ultimate goal of taking over the Templeton empire.   Laura struggles to make things work until she finds out that Peter is lying, cheating on her and stealing from her father's company.   Finding herself divorced and having the sole responsibility of raising her two children, life is far from the dreams Laura once envisioned. She refuses to be taken care of by her parents and insists on supporting herself and trying to survive the struggles of a single parent.  Enter Michel Fury, a friend of Josh, Laura's brother and husband to Margo, Laura's friend. Michael rents a home with stables on the Templeton estate and meets Laura. Ahh ... romance ensues, but if you think it will be a typical romantic story line, you're mistaken. Nora Roberts throws several other aspects into the mix. She shows Michael's struggles to win over and have a loving relationship with Laura's daughters. She shows Peter trying to wheedle his way back into Laura's life through the girls, but only for the purpose of blackmail. Roberts continues with the side mystery of the golden "magical" coins we've seen in the first two books in this trilogy. The story of the coins states that true love and happiness will be in the finder's future and lore has them lost on the cliffs near Templeton House. The story behind these coins is wonderful itself!  I have to say that one of my favorite parts of this book is when Michael decks Peter. Nora Roberts shows her sense of humor in letting Peter get what's truly coming to him.  This trilogy was the first Nora Roberts books I read and they made me a die-hard fan. One reviewer summed everything up by saying, "Nora Roberts's writing is the dream!" I can't argue with that! 
 	  This is a beautiful story of a girl who was a captive to both the Indians and the French.  Some parts of this book I did not like because of the way they called Indians "Redskins", although they might have called them that.  After I got into it, it was a lot more interesting.  The writing style was good, because it had different points of view, and it is historically accurate.  I couldn't put it down.    The book is an epic tale of a young girl who learns to adapt to her surroundings.  I loved this book from beginning to end.  I enjoyed reading it very much.   
 I have purchased both the Home & Gardens interior and the Punch interior software. Home & Gardens is much easier to use. You can really start without reading much of the manual. Punch demands that you read the manual (342 pages). It is not intuative. But Punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity. IE: Punch has a library of trees, shrubs and flowers for your yard. Home & Gardens only have potted plants, nothing you can use to landscape. Punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications. H&G doesn't. You have to choose a set style of door or window and change options.I also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my "house" on Punch to make it more realisitic. I like both software programs, but Punch has more options, but you have to do your homework first 
 There are more scientists alive now than have lived in all of the years since science was invented. And these myriads of scientists have made more discoveries that could have even imagined a few years ago. And it seems that with each new discovery it leads us to more open questions, many of which leave us with absolutely no clue as to even how to proceed to find an answer.   In the case of smell, there is the added sense that there hasn't been much interest in the subject among those who are writing the checks to conduct the research.   But that may be changing. Dr. Turin has devised a theory of scent that may lead to being able to predict what something smells like by examining its molecular structure. Now doesn't that sound dull?   Actually, it's quite a fascinating book. It pushes the limits of science in at least two ways. First, it's just about the most delightful read than you can imagine, from him walking into a perfume shop, seeing a Japanese company kiosk, sampling a new perfume and then describing it in about a whole page of text that would put a wine writer writing about a wine's bouquet to shame and then his girl friend left him and took the perfune with her. He couldn't find that scent again for 20 years. Can you remember a scent for 20 years? 20 days? 20 minutes?   Second, this is an insight into the perfume business (a hint - about 3% of the cost of a perfume is in the smell).   Third, it's about smell itself. And it turns out to be a fascinating subject, and possibly about a breakthrough in the technology 
 The children story Quack and Count was a neat little book that shows kids how to count to  seven in a fun little way.  What I like best was how the arthur was able to find different expressions to use in each of the different pages of the story 
 Patrick McDonnell's "Mutts" is one of the best comics in the papers.  Nothing could be finer then, than to have a book (or several) of the collected strips to peruse at one's leisure.  "Mutts" is funny, warm, clever, honest, and this collection has been nicely printed.  I was especially amused by the Sunday strips' clever references to comics of days gone by.  I hope that in the future, colored collections will be available 
 It is hard to find a book on Guiana, and while the author has a clear slant (as the title points out) it is still a good overview of the last 50 years of Guiana history and a must read for anyone who plans on looking into investment in Guiana or wants to learn more about the only English speaking country in South America.  
 X-Men: A Novelization arrived in perfect condition and was an excellent book to read

 Well-written, well-explained--especially that some kids can have problems, growing up, whether it's depression or substance abuse or ANOREXIA. Now, can someone please annotate it with definitions in American English--and--SOURCES in the USA.  (This subject is too important to risk misunderstanding "Brit Speak"! 
 I have been very satisfied with the monitor.  It is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate.  I was disappointed to find when I opened the box that there were no instructions included.  A quick phone call had them on the way.  I was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time, etc.  All-in-all it is a quite satisfactory device 
 Finola Hughes' "Soapsuds," centered around Kate McPhee, a Londoner who came to the U.S. to escape the horrible discovery that her best friend and her boyfriend was having an affair. She was offered a role in the popular soap, "Live for Tomorrow," where she played the role of Detective Devon Merrick. As she somehow stepped on the wrong foot of the "Queen" of soaps, Meredith, Kate's role as Devon switched sexual orientation! Not having any problem with that and trying to stay clear of Meredith's way, Kate gave her best to the role and it became a huge hit! Soon, Kate was travelling to soaps convention, Emmy awards, and etc. However, the only problem was, she was falling in love with her leading man, Wyatt, who happened to be the husband of Christine, her only friend in Los Angeles.  I enjoy "Soapsuds" as it provides a great insight into the lives of soaps actors and actresses. It may seems like it's easy work but there are lots of long hours involved as well as the pettiness of the people in the industry. The author, Finola Hughes was afterall a soaps actress herself and she was able to provide lots of "insider information." However, the book is extremely long and it can get quite tedious sometimes as in addition to having keep up with the real plot, I find that I have to keep up with the plot of "Live for Tomorrow," too. Not to mention, the scripts for "Live for Tomorrow," was a bit too much I think. Nevetheless, this is still an interesting read and I think "Soapsuds," appeals to both soaps and non-soaps fans! 
 Anthony Paul's book covers all styles of water gardens with accompanying photos and plans. Construction techniques are clearly explained, accompanied by line drawings. Plants to use for stocking the water garden  appear in a separate section, as well as a glossary of terms.  While most  of the gardens featured were designed by landscape professionals, many of  the ideas can be extracted and incorporated into one's garden 
 I made 3 recipes out of this book for a party the day I received it, all three for things I had never attempted to make previously - and all 3 were a huge success. I have successfuly used it several times since, and while many recipes can be time consuming if you don't plan ahead, there are a few fairly simple and quick ones.  It is porbably not for you if you are only looking for simple appetizer ideas or if you don't want to purchase somewhat advanced pastry utensils (i.e. fluted cookie cutters and tartlet forms), but as other reviewers have said, it is an excellent inspiration for those of us who love to cook 
 This album is an example of one of the reasons Eric Clapton is still popular after all these years. He knows how to please the majority with his consistently pleasant, middle of the road music. Recommended for casual, curious, or hard core Clapton fans (who probably already have a copy). His strong cover of J.J. Cale's 'Cocaine', and his two self-penned songs, the beautiful and earnest 'Wonderful Tonight' and the toe tappin', knee slappin' 'Lay Down Sally' (co-written with bandmates, Marcy Levy and George Terry) are reason enough to purchase the album.  
 Though I could do without the references to Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, this book is one of the better written books I have ever read. Within the first paragraph are tens of words I rarely come across, and as an avid reader, that's saying a lot.  The story is unpredictable and it's almost written as if the author is simply a servant to the book, rather than the other way around.  I found the relationship between the professor and the girl half his age the most interesting, her character is cleverly defined and her dialogue always takes me by surprise.  Definitely worth a look 
 i love good morning vietnam because robin williams does an amazing job of balancing humor and drama. this is one of my favorite movies of all time, and i highly reccommend it to everybody. you've got to watch it more than once, because you'll see something new or catch another sly joke each time 
 Not your typical thick, floral-smelling perfume, this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises--like lemon juice mixed with sugar.  It's a seasonal perfume (I can't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter).  It smells very crisp, fresh, and clean, which I enjoy a lot, but I imagine others would not; the same things I like about this perfume, could smell like a cleaning product to others.  Go to your fridge.  Get a lemmon, squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar.  If you enjoy the smell you get, buy this perfume--I highly recommend it.  If not, stick to something more traditional and vanilla/floral like Ana Sui's "Dolly Girl" 
 Compared to today's action thrillers, this is sedate.  However, there is more to a movie than speed.  What it does well is remind us of our heritage.  Although Hollywood may not have been accurate in its portrayal of the Seabees, this movie goes a long way in helping us understand their courage and contributions 
 The satire isn't as harsh, and the humor isn't as brilliant as you will find in Austen's major works, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this little book.  It's a charming and funny short novel that spoofs gothic fiction and romantic sentiment in a way that is surprisingly modern. Although the novel is full of subtle references to Jane Austen's favorite (and least favorite) books, you don't need to know anything about them to enjoy the story. Think of it as a teen comedy with moments of slapstick, lots of offbeat humor, and social embarassment galore, and you will be right in the spirit of Northanger Abbey.  Some of the customs and vocabulary in the book are out of date, of course. But most of it will be easy to understand even without footnotes, (although it's nice to have them handy if you need them). Austen's wonderful talent for dialogue still makes this little novel a treat to read. I have re-read Northanger Abbey every year since I was a teenager myself, and I still smile all the way through it!  
 I've been hooked on Morrell since "The Brotherhood of the Rose." A master researcher and a brilliant story teller, Morrell can not be pinned down to any one genre. Always fast paced, his tales drag you along like a fish on a hook until the very last page.  -- Mark LaFlamme, author of "The Pink Room. 
 The Covering is a great little book that gets the the heart of Pauls letter the the Ephesians.  This small easy to understand book should be in every Christians library 
 When I finished reading this book, I felt it is one of the most perfect things I have ever read, and also the most deeply depressing book I have ever read.  The bleakness and struggle of this world is relentless. The more recent version of this story with Tara Fitzgerald is glossier than this version, and much shorter.  It is because this is a miniseries; this length makes it more like the book.  Like the strong, steady, slow plodding of the mill wheel, the river runs through this story and makes everything musty and dank.  (4 stars because, like many of the 70s miniseries, it does drag a bit at times)  I think this version suffers from the casting of young Maggie Tulliver and the horrible wig that she wears.  This child is more willfully dislikable than the girl of the story who is always caught in the wrong by trying to do what is right; and when she transitions to a young lady the change is unbelievable, because the basic character changes so much with the change of the actress.  This leaden little girl becomes a sprightly, delicate young woman.  (Ironically, Tara Fitzgerald's Maggie would be a very good match for this girl - her portrayal of Maggie was very bull-headed.)  But this type of casting match - child to adult of the same role - is always difficult and can be forgiven.  Taken individually, each actress does a wonderful job, and Pippa Guard is nice to end up with; her lightness gives the character a new dimension.  George Eliot presents us with characters who have great internal dissonance with their exterior (appropriate for a woman writing under a man's name).  ANTON LESSOR, who plays the "hunchback" friend is creepily odd in the early scenes (because he is simply too old to be playing that age) - but that weirdness is just the right way to introduce this character.  He has a wonderful extreme contrast about his person and his presentation that create a real discrepancy, and this is precisely what this character needs to have, and it is marvelous casting.  We need to feel sorry for him, like who he is, but feel revolted by him as well, and between his performance and the Direction, this is achieved....no easy task!  Christopher Blake, as the infuriatingly arrogant brother also hits all the right notes, and in this case the young actor playing the younger version of him matches him tone for tone.     The book has a very problematic section of an elopement (of sorts), problematic, because in the book we spend that time in Maggie's internal emotions and thoughts, and the turmoil of her inner conflict is impossible to flesh out in film.  Thankfully, this version does a very good job of establishing her conflicting motivations, without becoming too talky or expository.   Dark and murky, this is an interesting story of complex lives in difficult times, beautifully directed by Ronald Wilson. 
 I'm 75.  During the 30's and 40's I danced to and enjoyed the "big Bands."  This book, by Fred Hall, includes great conversations with many of the leaders.  You learn how they got started, problems they had, who was easy to work for, who was a tyrant.  You learn that there were great bands BEFORE the Big Bands of the 40's (Jimmy Lunceford for one).  Every successful leader had a mentor and it's interesting to see who mentored who 
 These component cables operate as well as the Monster cables I spent much more on.  They don't look quite as cool but they feel heavier and sturdier than the Monster cables that cost 5-10 times as much.  I highly recommend this product 
 This is Greg Brown's best yet!  He turned some sort of corner with Further In (96), some sort of move toward the older, wiser and more moving, but with Slant 6 Mind he has produced his masterpiece.  I saw him with Bo Ramsey at the U. of Utah this fall, and it was amazing to hear the sound produced by just the two of them.  Bo watches the strings as he plays bluesy electric guitar, and so his cowboy hat is always low over his face and he bobs and weaves around so energetically on his skinny legs, it's a wonder he doesn't fall over.  The album starts out strong with the title track, a bitter attack on the commodification of everything:  "I was looking for what I loved...  Whatever it was, it's gone."  The best song, and the album's centerpiece, is "Billy From the Hills," for and about Greg's father.  What is celebrated here is a life of integrity, a real life close to the land:     "You can strip the trees, foul the streams, try to hide in progressive dream, ease into the comfort that kills.  Before I do that, I'll grab my pack and disappear with Billy from the hills."    Greg's father was a preacher, and despite Greg's humor and earthiness, he is clearly passing on some strong moral teaching.

 This book was a fun look at life in New York City.  The story was fantastic and the book was full of interesting characters.  I would definitely recommend this book to a friend 
 I like this apron a lot!!  Comfortable, nice cut and doesn't look like a granny piece!!  Washes nicely 
 The is a wonderful collection of hymns.  Alan should do more acoustic work. Glad his mother was finally able to get him to cut the CD.  Sang most of the songs while growing up in El Paso.  Already liked Alan but this collection of songs shows he is blessed with talent.    Have bought 2 of these to share with family members.  My aunt who just turned 99, thought it was great.  
 When her elderly husband Raynor dies, Marion is told by her king that she will wed again.  Her husband-to-be is Wyborn the Indomitable; a fierce Viking warrior that was just as likely to attack and pillage her home if he didn't marry her.  To save her people she agrees to the marriage with Wyborn.    Only Raynor's second in command Bodin, thinks he should be awarded the lovely Lady Marion and Ravenhill.  Planning to take control of Ravenhill with a surprise attack, he instead flees a coward when Wyborn arrives more than prepared for the assault.   Kate Hill has written a wonderful Viking historical.  Both Wyborn and Marion are surprised with each other as a person and as a spouse.  Wyborn is a fierce warrior yes, but he is also very protective of his people and considerate of their needs.  Marion is perfect for him as a wife; she is strong willed and really needed a man who could be a husband, more so than a father.  What I really like about her though is as a historical character, she is very feminine even though she is strong willed.  I also really like the fact that even though she initially tried to kill him, I think this is what first attracts Raynor to Marion!  I enjoyed the plot and the tension created because Bodin wants Ravenhill and is sore over getting his ass kicked (because he is a sleaze-bag and got what he deserves!).  I also greatly admire authors that stick characters in "sticky" situations and there are consequences that cannot be let off lightly (and the author doesn't!).  However, because every night there was a bedroom scene between Wyborn and Marion, I feel that the story started to loose some of its tempo.    If you want to consider Bodin the villain, there is a secondary villain that I found very interesting, completely misunderstood and in need of starting his life over and getting over his life long grudge.  Assuming he survives, I would be very interested in reading his story!    All and all, THE CHIEFTANS BRIDE was an excellent change of pace for me, and I would recommend the story 
 I play this today, this is a great collection. Every song is great. "N*gga What" is what entised me to this CD. A friend let me borrow it and ended up letting me keep it. God Bless him cuz this is a great CD 
 The first song I ever heard of Diana Krall was 'Peel me a grape' and boy did I fall in love.  I automatically bought the cd and fell in love.  She is one of the first jazz artists I was introduced to and remains to be my favorite 
 Quite simply - the HOH series are the best I have seen out there on no limit hold 'em tournament play. This book takes you through a bunch of examples and in a similar vein to the previous two volumes, provides you with some new tools to help make optimal decisions in a variety of situations. I liked the real life examples and associated hand analysis - having said that, I don't think much would be missing from your game if you only went through the first two volumes 
 I have seen this movie dozens of times, both in Imax theaters and on VHS and now DVD. It never gets old. I envy those that are seeing this for the first time: a couple of tips: watch on the biggest screen available with a good surround system hooked up and volume turned up to 11. Press "Play" and prepare to be blown away 
 I love historical fiction, and The March was one of the better historical novels that I've read. The characters are well-drawn, and the action moves along briskly, with no dead spots.  The civil war background seemed very authentic, and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions, The March blends the two to show that war really is hell.  Doctorow is an excellent writer, and he obviously did a lot of period research to make the background so believable.  My only objection was his implication that the civil war was only about slavery and that Union soldiers fought solely because of the slavery issue.  That's not true, as studies of Union soldiers' letters and diaries have demonstrated that most soldiers fought out of patriotism or to join with other family members, or for other reasons than just slavery.  That also applies to Confederate soldiers.  A minor quibble that doesn't really hurt the book, but it does discredit the author for not sticking to real, documented historical fact.  Highly recommended 
 Prior to Sound of the Beast, I think metal fans had lost hope that a decent book on this powerful and mesmerizing music would ever be written. Ian Christe has changed everything. This is a fascinating and hilarious account of not just the masters -- Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Black Sabbath -- but also the unsung heroes -- Sodom, Celtic Frost, Raven, Sepultura, Immortal -- of the metal world. For all of Sound of the Beast's accomplishments, the most impressive is how it works as a primer for the beginner, and also a renewal of faith for the metal veteran. Truly the metal gospel. 
 This book was excellent. More informative and suspenseful than the others, and it will keep you reading for hours. It was well worth the late night to go pick it up. Can't wait till book 7! 
 Whatever was a good crossover single between the sounds of 'definitely maybe' and 'morning glory'. It is also one of their best radio songs meaning everyone has heard it, but may not own it. I'm assuming this song will be included on an Oasis 'best of' compilation one day, but until then, this is a must have for all Oasis fans, as it is unavailable on any other Oasis release unless you were lucky enough to get the special bonus disc release of 'definitely maybe'. I think this song summed up the band perfectly in their early days and defined who they wanted to be. The B-sides are just as good as the title track, and while they are also available on other LP's, they flow through perfectly on this CD 
 Visions in Death is an amazing novel about the relationship between Eve and Roarke This novel is a gripping read from beginning to end. These two writers are awesome and I must add that I have never been disappointed reading their close to 20 books. If you are a fan of the "In Death" series, then you certainly will enjoy this book as you have enjoyed the others. The characters were just amazing, especially in their relationships with one another over the stories.  In this book, there is a serial killer on the loose, and on her tracks is Eve who despite the hectic nature of the job, works herself to exhaustion, and nevertheless starts a new phase in her life by opening up to her friends about the abuses she underwent in her horrible childhood days. The mystery was good, Robb adds a psychic to the mix for something new. There end was sweet, especially the great twist at the end which was difficult for anyone to see coming. With wonderful characters, a superb setting and fast pace, this story stands as a classic.Triple Agent Double  , Origin of Death are thrillers  I also enjoyed. Still I enjoyed this book 
 I was quite unsure on whether to buy the film or not as i didn't think it was going to be my type of film. But i bought the game anyway although i hadnt yet seen the film. Anyway im glad i did! It only took me two days to complete but although it isnt long long, it is very good from beginning to end, basically going round different rooms of the house doing different things which may seem borin, actually it is really fun! The activites etc are great! it is definately a good game if you like the more adventurous games that arent too hard, like me, too hard games arent really my type! Now i so cant wait to see the film which i recently bought 
 The pictures in this book make learning anatomy a lot more fun.  The section on bony landmarks is excellent.  The section on the planes of the body and ranges of motion are also uncomplicated to learn from.  For example, the pictures on the ranges of motion of the neck made it really clear how to figure out the difference between rotation and lateral flexion.  This book was really good to help me study for the national certification examination for massage and bodywork.  Other books that I also recommend for studying for the national certification examination include,  The Ultimate Study Guide for the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork: Key Review Questions and Answers (Topics: Human Anatomy, Physiology, and Kinesiology) Volume 1  The Ultimate Study Guide for the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork: Key Review Questions and Answers (Topics: Clinical Pathology and Recognition of Various Conditions) Volume 2  The Ultimate Study Guide for the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork: Key Review Questions and Answers (Topics: Massage Therapy and Bodywork: Theory, Assessment, and Application. Professional Standards, Ethics, and Business Practices) Volume 3  These study guides had important, relevant questions and answers that showed me what was important for the national certification exam.    Trail Guide to the Body is a keeper 
 I live (and hunt) in this country Mr. Galvin writes about.  As a young boy I had my favorite books and movies about the West. I took this book on a camping trip this summer with my 2 year old daughter up above the Platte River and the (godawful) Cherokee Meadows subdivision , just below the WY/CO border. We read the "Often I am permited to return to a meadow" poem togather as the sun set behind the Sierra Madres.  I hope she enjoys this book as much as I did 
 Excellent wrist pad, it was worth it, it's exactly what I wanted nothing more nothing less. It is an attractive black for those in the office 
 I agree with many of the reviewers--in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb, but it is not quite as sharp as a tele--as one of the reviewers said--it does many things, and not all of them perfectly--the lens is a compromise, but an excellent compromise--the VR is an added boost-- I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back, because of the weakness in the tele-- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility.--I don't want to keep changing lenses 
 Lilian Smith's recollection of Christmas as a child at the turn of the century transports one to a kinder and gentler time--one where the anticipation of hog killing is at once a wondrous and dreaded occasion! My  family and I roll with laughter at the exploits of a large family in the  south. Our mouths water at the descriptions of traditional southern  delights. Truly a book of rare insight and warmth. A must read every  Christmas season 
 This booked turned an ordinary middle of the week evening into a time-travel weekend getaway for me. If Barbarella had a beach house, it would be in this book. I keep coming back to it for the sense of place and experimentation on every page, and to wonder at how much architecture of essence is concentrated in one spot on the map.  It strips away the glam veneer of the so-called Hamptons to show how creative minds used creative materials to construct fantastic but livable houses. I'm glad they're all in one book so I can escape any day of the week 
 Mr. Maugham's writing style is superb and he describes his characters with great care. All the characters that he decribes -- Elliot, Isabel, Sophie, Suzanne, and ofcourse Larry -- are very likable and the detail with which these characters are painted, is of superlative quality.  I got attracted to this book after I read the one line summary on the cover saying ... "story of a man in search for the answer to his question". But I'm afraid to say, that it did not quite match my expectation. It's only in the last but one chapter , does the author talk about Larry's findings and his journey of getting answers to his questions. For most part, I felt like it's a book more about Elliot or Isabel, leaving me impatient. All I wanted really was to know about Larry, about his findings, about his conclusions, about his journey ... and I don't think I got satisfactory answers for any of the things that I wanted to know.  However, I'd recommend this book for the sheer pleasure it gives to read Mr. Maugham's writing. But you will perhaps not get any answers to your questions 
 I believe it has been observed, more than once and in a variety of ways, that all of life is like a gigantic mirror. We see ourselves, everywhere. And, if we are beautiful (on the inside, where true beauty lives), then we will see beauty everywhere we look.  Life Is Beautiful puts this idea to the test. It posits a carefree, happy-go-lucky book salesman who romances a well-to-do lady in Mussolini's Italy (the film starts just on the onset of WWII). As he weds her, and they rear a child, they are soon put into jeopardy due to his Jewish heritage. Ultimately, they are sent to a Concentration Camp where his carefree, imaginitive and unceasingly joyful attitude are the only things that keep him, and his son, from utter despair.  Humor? Romance? Carefree? In a Nazi Death Camp?  To some, this is blasphemous. But to the makers of this film, and our lead character, life is beautiful, and this vision is taken from their perspective. That the film manages to show that there is joy, love and beauty--even in the worst imaginable conditions--is a testament to the way in which the film succeeds, and also to the basic truth of the message. Yes, things may be awful (and more often then not, they are)... but yes, also: life is beautiful.  This film gets my highest recommendation. Five stars 
 I purchased this book for my 17 year old daughter. She needed it for an assignment at school. The book was exactly what she needed.  It shipped fast and is in great condition 
 My hope was to read a novel that gave an accurate and detailed account of the world my grandparents lived in and I was not disappointed. As with the best historical fiction, I was able to gain a sense of not just the environment and setting, but its effect on the main characters, especially David, the main protagonist.   While the prose is often challenging and innovative, the book is a surprisingly easy and quick read that I could not put down. While I was often frustrated by David's inner dialogue, the author must be commended for attempting to convey the inner workings of a child's mind, how his thought process often chaotically bounced around from one thought to another. The author also uses language in a very unique and interesting fashion, namely the contrast between early 20th century New York slang, composed of so many different ethnic groups, to the authors "translation" of Eastern European Yiddish.   For anyone currently reading the novel, who might feel frustrated at a seeming lack of direction in the plot, my advice is to keep reading, as its themes of alienation, growing self-awareness, family, sexual awakening and assimilation become more apparent as the story progresses. And for those who have yet to read the book, I strongly recommend not reading the introduction until after you've finished the book, as it pretty much gives away almost everything that happens in the story and really should have been the Afterword. Regardless, it happens to be a well-written analysis of the novel and can even help the reader in his or her own thoughts and opinions of what is most definitely a classic of 20th century literature. 
 Though some still argue about this book and its accuracy of what happened, it does open our eyes to the dangers of mountain climbing. The debate is even more heated today after a climber was recently left behind by fellow climbers and died. This book is riveting in its details for a non-climber like myself who wonders how anyone could've survived at all when a storm hits their team high on Everest. Some may read the book and further understand the need to strive to reach the top no matter what the cost, while others might ponder a question that is being asked more and more; 'Are too many people, especially amatuers, trying to climb Mt. Everest?' Chrissy K. McVay author of 'Souls of the North Wind 
 Rosenblatt's book makes a major contribution to Rousseau scholarship.  She lays to rest the common idea that Rousseau was a utopian dreamer unconnected to a concrete political program.  By situating Rousseau's political thought in the context of the constitutional crises of Geneva, Rosenblatt solves numerous puzzles that arise for inquisitive readers of Rousseau's *Social Contract* and other works.  The historical research is first-rate, revealing Geneva to be a hotbed of political conflict in Rousseau's day.  This is a must read book for all Rousseau scholars and those interested in a deeper understanding of his thought 
 I learned of this book from another novelist's work, Kola Boof, and was moved to check out why "Boof" (who is vaginally circumcised) is so enamoured of Walker's work and especially holds this book in so much esteem.  I had no idea that there would be so many other facets to the story that have nothing to do with the main subject of female genital mutilation or that Walker could reveal so much about African society, culture and the lives and suffering of African women.    I am an African woman, so this work is monumental to me.  I was quite moved and I recommend this to anyone who cares about the lives of women and especially the suffering of African women and girls.    
 I was worried that my 15 month-old will be to young to start playing with Legos, but she proved me wrong. She loves them and can play even alone. These are little bit smaller than the first set we got, but still bigger than their regular size for older kids. I would recommend this toy to everyone with small children: it improves their motorical skills and coordination 
 I like this style of salad spinner. When I ordered it, though, I didn't realize that it is as small as it is. It would be adequate for one person who doesn't chow down on salad all day. I recomend the product if you don't have much salad to spin 
 After enduring the so-so performance of my stock ipod headphones, I figured it was time to step up.  As I travel constantly, I wanted something that would would block out exterior noise; as a music freak I wanted something that would sound great.  After countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get (UE vs. Shure vs. Etymotics) I bought the Super.fi 5 pros.  In the end it was the price, Amazon was selling then for $90 less than the MSRP. Can't beat that. As soon as they were delivered I hooked them up and put them on.  They aren't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down.  I keep the volume on my ipod way down, a fraction of what I kept it at with the stock headphones.  The room I was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open, so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement.  With the UEs on, it was just me and the music.  A fire engine thundered by, normally a painfully annoying experience.  Again, the UEs reduced it to the point that I didn't realize the fire engine was coming until I saw it drive by. As for the music.  I first played a couple of tracks by Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins.  I immediately noticed elements to the music I never even heard with my other headphones.  Jenny Lewis' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like I was listening to them for the first time.  Next I put on some Ray Charles.  With the UEs, it was like I was there in the front row.  The horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while I discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section.  I've read complaints that in ear headphones don't produce enough bass, so I decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from Siamese Twin by The Smashing Pumpkins.  While I'm not by any means a bass head, I need some bass to enjoy rock albums.  I couldn't have been happier with how the UEs performed.  The drums in the album (which I've always considered some of the best) came alive.  The guitars actually had some balls, but didn't overpower the singing or drums. As is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time, your ears are bound to hurt a little.  I found this to be the case only for a day or two, after that the UEs fit snugly without any complaint.  The only weird thing I encountered had to do with ear wax.  My wife, an audiologist, forbids the family from using Q-tips.  So after taking the UEs off for the first couple of times, there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones.  Like the discomfort, this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times I used the UEs, and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue. When there are so many excellent products out there, finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging.  I've never tried on Shures or Etymotics, so I can't compare the performance of those headphones and the UEs.  What I do know is that I got a really great deal on the best headphones I've ever had.  Without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones I will buy for some time.

 THIS BOOK IS WONDERFUL!!! I READ IT DAILY! SEVERAL TIMES A DAY! MY LITTLE GIRL WENT TO HEAVEN 19 MONTHS AGO, SHE WAS 20 MONTHS OLD, SHE HAD MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE, THIS IS A VERY RARE AND PROGRESSIVE NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE. LIFE IS VERY HARD FOR ME, ITS A STRUGGLE, BUT I CAN PICK THIS BOOK UP AND READ JUST ONE PAGE AND THE PAIN IS NOT AS BAD. I LOVE IT!! IT HELPS ME GO ON!!  I READ "HOLDING ON TO HOPE" WHILE MY BABY WAS SICK, AND I WOULD JUST THINK "GOSH, I HOPE THAT I CAN BE STRONG LIKE THIS AUTHOR"!, THEN AFTER MY BABY DIED, I WAS ON AMAZON AND THIS BOOK WAS SUGGESTED TO ME. IT IS REALLY GREAT, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.  
 Fantastic book!   I have been wearing glasses since 1970, but since reading this book and practicing the principles explained within it, I doubt I will have to continue wearing glasses much longer.  After only one month, I have noticed a definite improvement in my eyesight -- glasses which were once too weak for me are now almost too strong!  
 Powerful and moving, "The Mill on the Floss" is considered to be George Eliot's most autobiographical novel. Along with "Middlemarch" it is my favorite. Set in early 19th century England - St. Ogg's, Lincolnshire to be exact - this is the tale of gifted, free-spirited Maggie Tulliver and her selfish, spoiled brother, Tom, who were born and raised at Dorlcote Mill on the River Floss. Eliot's portrayal of sibling relationships is terribly poignant and plays a major part in the novel, as does the longstanding rivalry between two local families - the Tullivers and the Wakems.   From earliest childhood Maggie worships her brother Tom, and longs to win his approval, and that of her parents. However, her fierce intelligence and strong streak of independence bring her into constant conflict with her family. She finds, in literature, the kindness and love she longs for in life. "...everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to Maggie: there was no indulgence, no fondness, such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was not a happy one Maggie felt. If life had no love in it, what else was there for Maggie?" Her nature, complex, passionate, sensuous, noble, intellectualized, and spiritualized, is of great importance to this novel, as is the pathos of her relationship with Tom.   Maggie's early years are brilliantly and unsentimentally portrayed from a child's perspective. The author structures a sequence of childhood's phases, which might appear, at first, to be random vignettes, but constitute an excellent psychological basis on which to build a character and motivation. Eliot once stated, "my stories always grow out of my psychological conception of the dramatis personae." Thus, the author chronicles Maggie's life as she grows from a precocious little girl to a strikingly attractive young woman, tall with full lips, and a "crown" of jet black hair. Her lack of social pretension makes her even more charming and likeable. As she matures, her conflicts with her brother, her family, even with her community, increase significantly. She, herself, feels torn between what is considered her "moral responsibility" and her search for self-fulfillment. Ultimately, she demonstrates honor and courage in the face of the disapproval of a narrow, tradition-bound society.   Parallel to, and intertwined with Maggie's story, is that of families Tullivur and Wakem. After Tullivur loses his mill and social respectability through bankruptcy, (a loss precipitated by a rash lawsuit he undertook), Wakem purchases it all. Mr. Tullivur agrees to stay on as manager. At first he seems resigned to his misfortune. However, within the space of a few pages he is swearing vengeance on the new owner and cursing him. He actually summons Tom to inscribe his curse on Wakem in the family Bible, and makes his son swear to uphold it. The feud becomes violent when Wakem, in the role of proprietor, appropriately corrects Tullivur's management of the mill. Of course the criticism is taken as an insult, and shortly afterward, upon meeting his boss on the road, Tullivur horsewhips him in "a frenzy of triumphant vengeance." Tom sees this uncontrolled outbreak of madness as the result of long repressed hatred. Mr. Tullivur never repents his beating of Wakem. His injured pride and sense of righteous indignation, justify him in his own mind. This lack of forgiveness is also demonstrated by Tom for his sister. In direct contrast, Maggie couples love with forgiveness.   As she reaches adulthood, Maggie finds herself torn between her relationships with three extremely different men: her proud, stubborn brother, Tom; Philip Wakem, a beloved friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy; and a charismatic but unacceptable suitor. When Tom is thrown suddenly into the role of adult, after his father's death, he becomes obsessed with acquiring social status and power. He attempts to arrange a socially advantageous marriage for Maggie, and when she refuses, he severs ties with her.   I won't spoil your read with any further discussion of the novel's details, especially the dramatic conclusion. George Eliot writes with a keen sense of humor, especially when addressing the grotesque in the human character. Her narrative has great depth, as insight to character and social observations are more important to Eliot than pace and action. "The Mill On The Floss" is deeply romantic - a work of great beauty and a literary classic. I cannot recommend it highly enough.   "The Mill On The Floss" is based partially on Eliot's, (born Mary Ann Evans), own experiences with her family and her brother Isaac, who was three years older than she. Eliot's father, like Mr. Tulliver, was a businessman who had married a woman from a higher social class. His wife's sisters were rich, ultra-respectable, and self-satisfied. These maternal aunts provided the character models for the aunts in the novel. Like Maggie, Eliot was extremely intelligent, energetic, imaginative and unconventional. She did not fit traditional models of feminine beauty or behavior, causing her family a great deal of consternation. Eliot lived with a man who she had not married - a daring enterprise in Victorian England. By the time this novel was published, she had gained considerable notoriety as an "immoral woman."   This edition has been edited by Gordon S. Haight, with an Introduction by Dinah Birch further relating "Mill On The Floss" to George Eliot's own life and times.  JAN 
 If you even think you might like this album you'll love it. This great album was a lucky find for me. Williams is a poet and an incredible song writer. The music ranges from thoughtful introspection to gutsy and fun. I  love Kate Wolf, John Stewart, Terry Allen, and Guy Clark but this album is  somehow better. Don't miss it 
 Download takes awhile, but the picture quality was great, even full screen. It played all the way through. And, to boot, it's an excellent show 
 Not bad performance, but not very quiet, and a little bit slow 
 I would put this camera in 5/5 rating if the it could work fine in low light. In day light or in electric light even if not so bright, this camera does a good job.  The look and Feel: Perfect. Its fits on the palm of my hand and its very comfortable to handle.  Movie: Wonderful quality in broad daylight 5.0/ 5.0. In low light 2.0/5.0 Average night light 4.5/5.0  Picture: 3.0/5.0 But this is not meant to be a digital camera. But still does a decent job on that side. Over all: 4.5 /5.

 This is a great dvd for plus sized women!  When I first started doing it I had to pause the dvd often, but now as I have progressed I no longer have to do so.  If you are just starting out, don't give up!  Hit pause if you need longer.  Work out with the remote by you so you can adjust.  You will catch up!  Also do not worry if you cannot get you do not breathe as fast as Megan does.  Just do what you can, you will catch up with time!  I cannot rave enough about this dvd and how much it has helped me tone up.  I noticed the difference in my body right away and also in my flexability.  It helps me with my lower back pain, the tendonitis in my hip, and other problems.  It feels sooooo good to be able to stretch my aching back out and and feel the muscles respond in a good manner!    I love the way Megan talks to the viewer and lifts you up and gives you strength and confidence.  Megan is a beautiful person inside and out and lovingly accepts us large sized people and it is reflected in this dvd.  She never mentions that large sized people need to lose weight but that we should be proud of who we are and be strong!  VERY empowering!   If you are reading this THANK YOU MEGAN 
 Bass players respect other players who play the bass and the bass guitar particularly when they play both well. MM is slamming on both. Most know of him because of work he does with other "big" name arists. MM's first release has several great tunes. Outer Drive has rec'd lots of airplay on Smoot Jazz formats. My favorite is Bottom Line for the slamming bass riffs and the clean horn sound of Roy Haynes. The story behind Keys To My Heart will make you cry. It was my inspiration to buy the CD when I saw MM play with Kirk Whalum. Now that I have seen him perform his own set, can't wait to go listen to it again. Get This! NOW 
 The epitome of the snapshot. HCB has such an eye for composition; counterpoint, balance, symmetry, symbolism and just plain humour. I find myself shaking my head, often in disbelief at how he manages time and again  to catch that 'decisive moment'. This book has his Paris prints beautifully  reproduced and the one-line descriptions mirror the mood of the entire  collection - glimpses of life, love, conflict, smells, textures in that  colourful city. Colour rendered in black and white 
 Mr. Myles lets you know if you are not doing what your purpose for life is, you will never be content, no matter the amount of success you may have. He reminds us that God already has a purpose for us, and no matter what we might try to accomplish if that was not our purpose for life, it might not be accomplishe 
 At the age of 50, I, like many adults struggled with the meaning of what I had been doing for the past 50 years.   Most of it spent in pursuit of my generation thought of as the "American" dream.  Thoreau, in the classic work, answers many of those questions.  Less is actually more.  No review can do justice to this work; it must be read, and preferably in some wilderness location, away from the bustle of "city life".  ENJOY! 
 Perspective  Short: I am writing this review from the perspective of a high school student who started with Blitz, went on to a more advanced language, and is now revisiting Blitz again.  Long: When I first picked up the book, I was a high school student with no prior programming experience. I had written code before, but it was HTML so I didn't actually write programs.  I abandoned Blitz for a while when I finally got the chance to take a programming class(C++) in school and have recently returned and thus revisited the book to brush up. I took this oppertunity to write a review here.   C++ is a more advanced, powerful, and widely used language but I still use Blitz to make simple games because it's hard to get good graphics in a C++ compiler without costly graphics pacakges to go with it.  Opinion  Short: The book is very intuitive and well written. The author does a very good job at explaining things and the book is very well paced. When going to a more advanced language I was helped significantly by the concepts I learned when using Blitz. I would highly recommend this book.  Long: When I first got this book, I thought programming would be a daunting task. This book goes through it very well and has a nice pace that keeps you from getting overwhelmed. The author writes very clearly and is very good at explaining concepts. This is a great book to get started with programming.  When I dropped this because I started programming in C++, I found  transfering languages easier than I had hoped. I learned a lot of basic concepts in Blitz and was able to take many of them over into C++.   For a short time, the only real changes that I experienced were different syntax between the two languages and some other basic priciples (such as library functions) not used in Blitz. By the time I got to a point where most of the material I was learning had no equivalent in BLitz, I had been using C++ long enough not have any problems.  Conclusion  Short: It's a great, well written introductory book for those looking to program for fun or those who want to go further but need a good starting point.  Long: When I got this book, my purpose was to get something to introduce me into programming in a simple, easy to understand manner. I am happy to say that it works very well for this purpose. The Blitz language will not carry you especially far but  if you are in it for fun or are just looking for a starting point, this will work very well. I still program with it myself a bit even after learning a more advanced language 
 This book is invaluable.  All you need is a Christian with a will to grow, this book , and the Holy Spirit, and your life will be changed 
 This is one of the greatest book sever written, in my opinion. I read in tenth grade and will never forget it 
 This is a great box set. Like so many of the Proper sets offers lots of informative info into the music and the artisit. If you like Boogie Woogie Swingin' Hoppin' Country that provided alot of rock-a-billy sounds you'll love this set. If you're looking for hard core 60's rock-a-billy it's not here. A great set, well worth the money. Glad I bought it!  The Mean Eyed Cat KNON 89.3 Dallas, Texas   
 Human trafficking has been an issue throughout history, but has recently been getting more attention by policy makers and the press.  This film does a good job of highlighting one dimension of human trafficking -- the trafficking of women for sex.  Although a fictionalized account, the film illustrates the complex nature of the problem, including the obstacles to ending the practice. There are no easy answers, but the film reminds us that the problem is too serious to ignore. Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland are excellent, though having the federal agent played by Sorvino pose as a captured sex slave detracted from the believability of the film.  Thankfully, that was only a small element of the story 
 Wow!  I was so fascinated with this insightful book that I coined the above phrase.  Curtain-call economics is the thrust of this book.  How would your customer describe his experience with your company?  How entertaining, how engaging, how educational and how beautiful was his experience?  This book is chock-full of real-life examples of how to capitalize in this new arena comprising our economy.  First there arose an industrial era, then a service era, now, an experiential era.  With all types of services abounding and ubiquitous, your differentiation will be in providing the superior experience.  This book categorically and metaphorically allies you with the absolute fundamentals for positioning your establishment for success.  So, in keeping with one of the teachings of this book on building suspense, I will just say that there is an era immediately following this 'experience' economy that is delineated with much delight at the conclusion of the book 
 Its original idea challenges  us to look  in a new way at the things we don't have the answers for. Kevin Costner is Joe Darrow, an emergency doctor, who's pregnant wife Emily, also a doctor ,dies in a tragic accident in Venezuela while he's  in Chicago and trying desperately to reunite with her. Joe doesn't find her body and this leaves him haunted. His emotional pain is beyond belief, he buries himself in work. One day he remembers that Emily asked him to check on her paediatric cancer patients and he starts visiting them. Then unusual things begin to happen. The children who have had near-death experience have seen Emily and are trying to pass a message. Joe Darrow's already shattered world is now turned completely upside down. He is forced to change his beliefs. This is  dramatic and painful process and its end is a TRIUMPH of one of the greatest love stories ever told! Kevin Costner's performance as Joe Darrow is absolutely brilliant. His extraordinary talent shines in this complex and emotionally demanding role!   Dragonfly is a profound film. Its magnificent end is  affirmation of life and a great inspiration. After all :"It's belief that gets us there" 
 Don't be put off by the price of this book. A must read for anyone involved in computer programming 
 After centuries of persecution and anti-semetic feelings towards the Jewish people, the truth is clear, The Church (our) hands are stained with blood.  I read this book almost a year ago and the message still touches my heart.  If you want to know the extent at which you have been effected by anti-semetic feelings towards the Jewish people, read this book.  Dr. Brown, a Messianic Jew, is a scholar and does a very complete job of handling the anti-semetic attitudes of past Church leaders who are highly recognized and respected.  This book is very helpful in it's history and in it's tenderness and forgiveness offered to the Church for her persecution of the Jews.  Dr. Brown also very scholarly answers the assumptions and speculations that Church has replaced the Jewish people as God's chosen people.  No, God will save the Jewish people.  The veil will be removed and they will see their Messiah and turn to him with all their hearts.  And the Church and Israel will kiss. Glory 
 As a would-be restauranteur with plenty of general business experience and only limited kitchen-time, there were many, many areas where I felt deficient when gauging the scope of my business plans.  But "How to  Open & Run a Successful Restaurant" not only hit each of those  topics, but managed to offer alternatives, incite, history and trivia as  well.  Thomas offers not only information as regards opening a restaurant,  but also outlines the types of personalities often associated with the  business and the pitfalls that await the snobby, the paranoid, and the  burnt-out.  Great tips for decorating inexpensively as well as a few  suggestions regarding high-profit menu items punctuate what is, at its most  basic, a thorough look at the middle-class restaurant, from foyer to  kitchen, from management to staff, and from profit to poor-house 
 A really fascinating, jarring look at a corner of Wall Street that I did not know existed. Takes you back to the days of the Roaring Nineties when the Internet bubble and IPO mania was driving stocks skyward. Working around the edges of the market were criminals in Armani suits like the subject of this book, Louis Pasciuto.  Pasciuto was a sharp kid from the streets of Staten Island, and he was a cinch for the sharp talk of a hoodlum named Roy Ageloff, who ran the brokers at a crooked firm called Hanover Sterling. Pasciuto had a talent for ripping off investors, and he used that talent first at Hanover and then 17 other firms.  Watching Pasciuto on his rise and then fall is a truly unbelievable experience. Amazing that as a teenager he was already running an entire crew of other young thieves.   The book unveils the Mafia aspects of the book slowly and naturally, without sensationalizing. So we get realistic glimpses of what the Mafia has become in the later part of the 20th century. Through it all we get into the psyche of the Mafia gangsters, particularly the one who was principally shaking down Pasciuto, Charles Ricottone.  By the end of the book you come away with a deep appreciation of two things:  One is that the Mafia is definitely on its way out. I just finished reading Selwyn Raab's book Five Families, and that book, though also very good, failed to depict the Mafia's current state in quite as vivid a way as this one. Raab failed to adequately explore the personnel weaknesses that have decayed the Mafia. They become very obvious in reading Born to Steal. Obviously the people left in the Mob are low-level hoods without imagination or drive.  Second, you get a real sense of how Wall Street operates. Even though the book concentrates on on the lower rungs of the Street, you get a good appreciation of the kind of money-grubbing nature of the people who run Wall Street generally.  The epilogue, recounting what happened after the hardcover edition came out, is cynical and very funny.  In all, a very strong and readable book 
 My five-year-old son loves this book.  The first time, I read it out loud to him and his sister.  He has read it alone several times since then.  I think the writing is right on his level - he has tackled tougher books but not gone back to them like this one - and it is long enough that he doesn't finish it in fifteen minutes.  The story sounds to me just like something a kid would think of - for example, how Elmer crossed the river full of crocodiles.   I also asked my son what he liked about it, and he said, "Dragons."  He might have given a longer answer if he hadn't been busy reading the book at the time 
 This is a hidden gem, at least for the people outside the Italian speaking community. It is sad that Fabrizio left after this work of art but at the same time it's the best farewell gift someone can receive. This cd is perfect to listen to while enjoying an excellent glass of Port, fantasising how on earth a human being is capable of producing a cd this beautiful. My alltime favorite 
 This is a great book. As someone just begining to think about a home business, this book was very informative. I had had a general idea of what I might do, but this book helped clarify it and even gave it a name. It also gave me some other ideas to toss around. Beyond that however, the book was great in letting you know how to get started, some of the pitfalls to watch out for, and an overall sense of what it takes to start a home business. The only down side I found to the book was the constant references to other books by the same authors to get more detail information on any given topic. It was very frustrating when I didn't have the other books. But I guess their sales tactic worked since I bought two more of their books! I haven't read them yet, but because of this book I am looking forward to it 
 I bet all the people who rated this cd loved it from the first listen. This is one of those few cds that as soon as you put them on you cant stop grinning and thinking your money was very well spent. On another note i wanted also to agree with one of the other reviewers that said he couldn't stand people comparing these guys with Deep Dish. Their sounds are completely different, and Saeed & Palash are a little more tribal than Deep Dish 
 Great book.  As an educator, it was the best one on the market.  It only lacks current data, but the new edition coming in a couple of months should take care of that 
 Though I haven't had much time since I purchased this book, to go through each of the projects, I must say, the Vintage-style Beauty of many of the Flowers is Wonderful! The designs have a classic style that exudes an ELEGANCE, which is often lost in the french beaded flowers that I see more commonly.  There's a lot of competition out there with other french beaded flower books, and I think this one wholeheartedly makes a unique place for itself amongst the bookshelf where my collection of more than 30 french beading books rest. I don't think you'll be disappointed, and surely you will be INSPIRED...I know I was!! 
 Ah, the power of sex, and sexual images and thoughts, tawdry or otherwise. For some reason, I respond to seeing SS on the SS (silver screen) no matter how bad the script. I even liked her in "Casino" and "Basic Instinct 2". Of course, "Basic Instinct" is the Grail of SS movies. This one has many flaws, but it was never intended to be a Turner Classic Movie. As mere entertainment which offers a break from the often heart-breaking daily news, "Sliver" is not as bad as the critics said. 
 I have owned this albumn in several incarnations since it's original 1974 release:  LP, 8-Track (really!), casette and CD.  This is the best of the Englebert greatest hits packages and these 10 cuts (from the late 1960's and early 1970's) remain a definitive body of his work.  AM I THAT EASY TO FORGET, THE WAY IT USED TO BE and WINTER WORLD OF LOVE provide indulable memory burn.  Why didn't Englebert sing any of the James Bond themes 
 I really like this movie, although I don't count it as one of my top, top favorites.  But it is really funny and worth seeing.  I don't really know or care anything about Nixon's presidency.  But I saw this movie because I love the retro 70s music and clothes and atmosphere, and that is what I love about this film.  The songs are great, the clothes are sooo horribly awesome, and the characters are so well done.  Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams portrayed two dimwit "stupid teenage girls" with perfection.  Read everyone else's reviews, they already said it all 
 "Hotel Operations Management" takes a comprehensive look at all aspects of hotel management.  The coverage of all departments of a hotel is extensive and contemporary.  The authors bring industry experience to the book making the information usable and practical.  The book is extremely well-written and "user friendly" for anyone to read.  As Chair of the Hospitality Management program at the University of North Texas, I would definitely recommend this book to my faculty who teach Hotel Operations in my program. I give this book "5 stars!&quot 
  This is a well written book that aircraft designers and those engaged in a serious study of wing aerodynamics will find useful, helpful and handy. This is not a book for the novice but for aeronautical engineering specialists who can handle fluid dynamics theory, performance and other mathematical manipulations. Although the book has been around for some time (I first used it at university as a recommended text in aerodynamics over 25 years ago), the theory and concepts are still very much relevant and applicable today.  For those seeking advanced knowledge on wing aerodynamics theory and have a flair for mathematics especially calculus, this is an excellent reference book that is well recommended. 
 I love this book so much! It is as much of a masterpiece as Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. This is actually the most feminist Bronte novel and the most corageous in dealing with social issues. It deals with the evils of drink and with domestic violece in a realistic way. Yet it is a beautiful lyrical book at the same time. It explodes the Victorian myth of "the Angel in the House", and savagely attacts the 19th century assumption that women must be kept innocent and ignorant for their own good.  It is  the Bronte novel which was panned upon its publication because it so strongly attacked the status quo of the time and this maybe why she is to this day wrongly regarded the inferior writer of the three.   
 Prince is truly a one of a kind artist, muisician, vocalist and lyricist. This collection of hits and b-sides is so good that I do not know what I should truly write to justify his amazing genius. Songs like when doves cry, 1999, purple rain, controversy and so many more are some of the best funk/rock tracks ever written with stupendous lyrics, tremendous vocals, and melodies that are breathtakingly good. There is now way that I can do Prince justice in this brief review but I consider him to be one of the best rock/funk artists of all time and this is a must have for anyone that likes amazing music or is a fan of Prince 
 This is very well written book that explains the writing and publishing  process in simple and easy to understand language. Mr. Wolfe do not want  his reders to have the misconception that publishing a cook book is an easy  process. But at the same time he helps you understand the process step by  step, and encourages you evey step of the way. One of the best books I have  read on publishing 
 This is an album that displays emtion in each of its song. Unlike many of todays artist who pose for certain look or stlye, Joy Division were about channeling their emotions through their music. Unknown Pleasures, a landmark album the world was not ready for its time of release and yet still an album that sounds fresh and not dated. From the opening track Disorder to the track I Rememeber Nothing, the album is a sonic venture unlike the world has seen. She's Lost Control alone a track that makes you feel like you are on the edge of losing control. Seeing footage of Ian Curtis perform SLC is simply shocking. As the beat of the Stephen Morris drums fuel the gyrations of what seems to be an  Ian Curtis in a state of epilepsy, one can wonder how Ian didnt lose control there and then. Whereas the power of Shadowplay can be summoned up in one lyric "In the Shadowplay acting out your own death.." Unknown Pleasures offers us a view into Joy Divisions world. A  dystopia in shades of grey 
 Forgive me for wasting all your time because I haven't read the book yet, but just reading about it fills me with excitement because I have Nietzsche's books to keep me company, a fellow Overman/madman/AntiChrist. If I can be so immodest as to compare myself to him in any way, I know from experience that as he descended into madness he thought he was the AntiChrist as Christian bigots would accuse, a worthy title for the great philosopher who is to enlighten the masses of the ills of Christianity and lead us into at least a less hypocritical time. Who knows what great work he would have produced in his later years if he had medication to keep him balanced, walking on the fence that separates the world of the sane from the insane. From up here you see all. I love you Nietzsche 
 Having enjoyed the recent release of Jean Renoir's "The River" on the Criterion Collection DVD, I was looking forward to seeing this film adaptation of yet another exotically set Rumer Godden book. As it turns out, this 1947 classic is far more enthralling thanks to the visionary filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, an intriguing plotline focused on the conflict between devotion and desire and a sterling cast headed by 26-year old Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodagh, a precursor to her similarly themed work in "Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison" ten years later.  The beautifully photographed movie tells an unusual tale of Anglican nuns who establish a convent in an extremely remote region of the Himalayas called Mopu. Chosen in Calcutta by her Mother Superior, Sister Clodagh becomes the Sister Superior, one of the youngest ever chosen, of the convent. Her primary task is a daunting one, to convert a donated sultan's palace into a convent, transforming it from a residence for concubines to a school and a hospital. The terrain, 9,000-foot elevation and climate all prove challenging, and physical problems are compounded by ensuing health issues and the decline in overall morale, the result of the invariable conflict between the sensuality of the environment and the regimented order of the nuns' lives.  Each sister reacts differently and manages their inner turmoil in different ways. Matters come to a head with the arrival of three outsiders - a cynical, agnostic Brit, Mr. Dean, who sparks unholy feelings among the sisters; the son of the General who bestowed the gift of the palace, hungry for education from the nuns; and Kanchi, an exotic native girl who is unruly and in need of male attention. The film's title refers to an exotic perfume, worn by the General's son, which clouds the air around their mission and consequently redirects the thoughts of the sisters to the world they were supposed to leave behind. All their lives collide in ways that lead to tragic consequences.  The hallmark of this movie is the lush cinematography by Jack Cardiff, who did similar duties on "The African Queen". Amazingly, the film makes extensive use of matte paintings and large scale landscape paintings (the artwork is by Peter Ellenshaw) to suggest the mountainous environment of the Himalayas. The cast is mostly quite effective. In one of her first starring roles, Kerr is superb as Sister Clodagh, providing the right shadings to her conflict-ridden character. However, it is Kathleen Byron (who looks eerily like Cate Blanchett) as the deranged Sister Ruth and a 17-year old Jean Simmons as Kanchi, who threaten to steal the picture. The suspenseful climax will remind you a bit of Hitchcock's "Vertigo" made 11 years later. This is a fascinating, subtly erotic film about repression and duty, sometimes melodramatic but constantly affecting, and quite worthy of viewing 
 I ordered this book so I could read it a second time.  I enjoyed it almost as much as the first time.  I like all of Farley Mowat's writing and stories of Eskimo life 
 Clark has an entertaining and informative radio show and the same can be said about his book.  Every last page has helpful hints about how to save money if you are serious about doing so.  Clark also throws in a section about investments and money management, hardly comprehensive but a terrific start for those who want practical advice about how to invest.  He covers everything from automobile buying to automobile repairs, carpeting, computers, credit and debit cards and other banking services, cellular phone and landline services and long distance, home buying, vacation and travel, and of course scams and rip offs.  "Get Clark Smart" hits the reader with a dense amount of facts about how to derive more enjoyment out of discretionary income.  The book lists hundreds of web addresses and can be used as a handy way to look for bargains for traveling, for example.  Overall, it's written in a friendly tone from a successful, smart person who is essentially sharing his treasure trove of knowledge about consuming in America to anyone willing to listen.  eco 
 This is the finest book I have ever read about nutritious food and where to find it. If you wish to learn how bad the food you buy at the super market is and how it has been treated without regard to your health please read this book. If you are concered about your health and the health of your family please read this book. Finally, someone tells us what and how to eat healthy. I feel so much better after reading this book.  
 Great speed, low errors and it works great in any DVD Playe 
 What can I say that others haven't for me. The movie is just a stunning revivement of the once-maligned Batman franchise, which took a nose dive with the one-two punch of Joel Schumacher's "Batman Forever" and "Batman & Robin" in 1995 and 1997, respectively. After B&R bombed at the box office (though it made over $100 million domestically) and the wannabe Batman revival film "Catwoman", the franchise seemed doomed to wallow in development hell. In 2003, newcomer filmmaker Christopher Nolan (who blew audiences away with his first feature film "Memento") and veteran screenwriter David S. Goyer (who penned all three scripts for the "Blade" series, which were also based on a comic book) approached Warner Brothers about doing another Batman movie, only this time taking the hero back to his roots and making it more realistic and believable. The film began production in early 2004 in London, casting Welsh actor Christian Bale as the titular hero Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth.. When the film finished principal photography, Warner Brothers decided not to pull a big ad campaign like they did for the previous four films, but decided to mute it and let the film sell itself.  The film opened with a good $72 million opening weekend and with ecstatic critical acclaim by critics nationwide. In a year that was filled with big blockbusters (including the highly anticipated "Revenge of the Sith"), "Batman Begins" demonstrated long legs at the box office, finally ending its theatrical run with a tidy $205 million profit domestically.  One of the reason "Batman Begins" did so well was the good word-of-mouth. People came back for repeat viewings (I did go and see it in theaters twice) and truth be told, it's an excellent movie to boot. It jetissons the campiness of the Schumacher entries and the excess Gothicism of the Burton entries and goes for a low-key realism. Sure, there are still minor elements in the film that recall other Batman films (the poison gas plot is redone from "Batman" and there are two villains), but they fit in with the surroundings. And it delves into Bruce Wayne's backstory via flashbacks and flash-forwarding to the present (it is non-linear, so one has to pay attention to the film right from the start) for a good bit of running time before remaining firmly entrenched in the present future. The Oscar-nominated cinematography is just stunning and while it still captures the darkness of the Burton films, it does so in a subtly different way. Every actor is well-cast, particularly Christian Bale ("American Psycho", "The Prestige") as the title character and balances Wayne's duality naturally. The movie also strikes a balance between exposition and keeping the action moving, and never loses focus. From the beginning right to the end credits, the movie is riveting and never boring. It stands well by itself, but the ending is purposefully wide-open for a sequel. (The sequel, "The Dark Knight" is currently in production and will have a July 2008 release date.)  The movie is available on DVD in two forms: separate single-disc full-screen and anamorphic widescreen formats and a widescreen-only 2-disc edition. It is also available in a out-of-print VHS format as well as on HD-DVD (the Blu-ray edition has yet to be released). As much as I'm a sucker for extras, I'll be reviewing the single-disc widescreen edition (which has a much better cover).  The film is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen and it looks absolutely spectacular from start to finish. (Nolan has said that he worked with the WB to make sure the film looked and sounded as good as possible on home video.) The film has a natural, more earthy tone than the simply Gothic and gaudy looks Burton and Schumacher imparted in the previous movies, and it handles contrast with ease. Black levels are smooth and inky, and compression is very well-done. There's no unwanted grain (other than just enough to impart a more film-like presentation), and no dirt or digital artifacts. For standard defintion DVD, this is one of the WB's best-looking titles.  While the 2-disc Special Editions of the previous "Batman" movies all get DTS audio, "Batman Begins" is excluded from the DTS treatment. Nevertheless, the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track is phenomenal. Dialogue is clear and placed in the center channel, while the surrounds are constantly in use, even in dialogue-driven scenes, where the ambience really helps draw the viewer in. But it certainly amps up the volume in the action sequences, with deep bass that'll shake the rafters and pinpoint surround activity (particularly the Tumbler chase and the climax on the monorail). Dialogue is never lost during the action sequences, and the score co-composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is always clear and detailed. A French 5.1 dub is included, and the film has optional subtitles in English, French, or Spanish.  As this is a single-disc release by Warner Brothers, there are mainly no extras on here save for the movie, the theatrical trailer (presented in anamorphic widescreen with stereo audio), DVD-ROM material and two skippable previews at start-up for "Smallville" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". The main menu and almost all of the submenus are animated (the scene selection has animated previews) and the film is divided into 40 chapters. The disc is placed in a regular Amaray case and no chapter insert is included.  If you haven't seen this movie due to the hype, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out. Both editions of the film (as well as the HD-DVD) present the movie in flawless digital clarity and stunning surround sound, so you won't lose quality either way in terms of presentation. Highly recommended and can't wait for the sequel 
 A pleasant blend of biography, comedy and cultural gender theory, Bornstein posits gender as a cult like structure, to which membership is compulsory. She critiques the prevailing notions about the relationship between anatomy and gender and envisages a new gender model based on fluidity and transgression. While the book is aimed at a wide market, her bibliography is extensive 
 I originally bought this book for my grand children who love dinosaurs,and ended up keeping it.This book is not just about dinosaurs but it is about the evolution of life from the beginning.As usual  Dorling Kindersley produced an excellent book superbly illustrated.I highly recommend it for people of any age.It is now part of my library 
 If everything one might ever need from a foreign-language dictionary could be put in book form that fits in a pocket or purse, this is it.  The Langenscheidt series is known for its concise format covering pronunciation, usage, idiomatic expressions, cross references and examples. The examples are particulary useful when determining how a particular word or expression fits into specific situations.  There are also special sections dealing with proper names, weights and measures, numbers and abbreviation 
 This film shows you the up & coming rap stars around that time, but it also pays due respect to the older artists who pioneered the rap game. Great concert footage & great interviews. The segment w/ Wu-Tang Clan  is classic 
 This book is probably the greatest ever written on the early history of black music in America. With rare clarity and glowing intensity, Baraka traces the evolution of black forms such as blues and jazz back to Africa,  and presents the reader with genuine insight into the world of the creators  of these important 20th century art forms. The book is as gripping as any  novel you will ever read, and also crammed with facts and mindboggling  lines of thought. Anybody with even the slightest interest in modern black  music needs to read this book, and consider its contents thoroughly 
 It is time to return to Hope Springs. The Cookbook Committee continues to meet, even after the cookbook has been finished, but the group keeps meeting,  and each woman keeps an eye and her heart out on the others.  The pastor, Charlotte Stewart is troubled by the undercurrents she senses, and the questions she struggles with.  Nadine struggles with her daughter's death by trying to follow her, as the other women try to tempt her to stay.  Margaret faces a health crisis as Jessie renews the marriage long given up as dead, and looks to new horizions .  Framed by the Hope Springs Community Garden Club Newsletter the book unfolds as each of these women try to meet her challanges.  It is the friendships that these women have forged that enable each to rise to her individual challange, but realize that the friendships that bind them are irreplaceable.  Lynne Hinton has been able to continue the story that began in Friendship Cake and has continued to develop the characters that have grown so dear to our hearts.  A wonderful book that does not disappoint, and leaves me wishing the next would be out sooner 
 It hasn't made a single hair appear on my bald head, and it has not revealed the secret of life to me.  All I can tell you is that it is amazingly fun, and the possibilities of what you can do are endless.  I bought two, and my son stole one.  The other is on my desk at work.  It has attracted a lot of attention from colleagues, and several have ordered their own after just a few minutes of playing with mine.  I'm a strong admirer of Roger von Oech's books and blog, so when I saw that he was associated with this "toy" I had no hesitation buying it. It is very well made, and the accompanying guide book is interesting and helpful. I highly recommend you get your own 
 Beautifully written, scholarly and quite dense in parts, I would thoroughly recommend it, even if only to read the Preface and the first chapter.  If you are interested in the Logos, the relationship between spirit and the word, then this book is a must.  I have been profoundly influenced by this work since I first read it as a boy at school, more than 15 years ago.  This book is both brilliant scholarship, and a masterful work of art 
    	Voice performer Robin Atkin Downes is a more than proficient actor - he's equipped to narrate in some 40 dialects.  Television aficionados recognize him for his appearances on Nash Bridges, Beverly Hills 90210, Buffy the Vampire slayer and others.  His London stage performances include starring in Dracula, Taming of the Shrew, Much Ado About Nothing, and more.  He delivers a stellar reading of "One Good Turn," by Whitbread First Novel Award winner Kate Atkinson.  	What does a Good Samaritan get for his trouble?  In the case of 50-year-old Martin Canning, a second tier crime novelist who spends much time in wishful thinking, maybe a star in his crown but only a wealth of woes on this earth.  	Set in Edinburgh, Scotland, our story opens with a crowd of people witnessing what appears to be a minor bumper bash but quickly turns ugly.  The driver of one of the vehicles  jumps from his car and brutally attacks the other driver with a baseball bat.  Just as a perhaps fatal blow is about to be delivered, someone in the crowd tosses a laptop case which deflects the attacker's aim.  The tosser  is Martin.   	For his life saving act, surely the most untoward thing he has ever done,  Martin  is robbed and worse.  	The crowd is quick to disperse, leaving  listeners  to believe that is the end of them.  Not at all.   Atkinson's magic pen brings them back,  weaves them throughout her narrative in surprising ways.  While we never know what life may hold in store, this author leads us on a fascinating journey of what it might.          - Gail Cook 
 I think you either love James Elkins or he leaves you cold. I've enjoyed everything I've read by him. Though this book is not for everyone, it's a strange & wonderful look at the physicality of meaning, the body as the translator

 I have purchased many simulated security cameras.  The Swann Simulated Security Camera is of excellent quality construction with a housing design that would fool even the most skeptical of viewers. Long term battery life (I have had the cameras blinking light last as long as 8 months without having to change the batteries!).  Highly recommend 
 Finally it's here on DVD.  You don't have to be an Insomniac anymore to see some of these Insomniac with Dave Attell shows.  On this DVD, Dave starts in New Orleans.  A little stand-up routine in a club that will get you laughing.  Then he takes you on a late night, all-night tour of what's happening in New Orleans while most normal people sleep.  This is the standard for all Insomniac episodes.  Dave visits a bar and drinks. Maybe two bars or three.   Talks with people on the street.  Some get crazy (females and males) to expose themselves for the camera.  All nudity and language is shown on this DVD, that was originally edited and blurred on Comedy Central cable network.  What is edited on this DVD is beer cans and telephone numbers.  No advertising beer names.  But we all know what Dave is drinking don't we?  Dave is alot of fun and he is funny too.  He will take you to many other cool places from 10:00pm until 7:00am.  It's educational too.  Adults Only! This DVD includes only five episodes. Dave visits New Orleans, Louisiana. Houston, Texas. Chicago, Illinois. Montreal, Canada. New York City, New York (last episode of first season).  The New Orleans, Houston and New York episodes are from the first season in 2001.  The Chicago and Montreal episodes are from the second season in 2002.  For mature adults only 
 This is probably the only entrepeneurial book I have ever read, but I would highly recommend it to anyone contemplating going into retail.  The lessons Jay Goltz shares in this book are important, whether you're a 'lone ranger' going-it-alone retailer, or an administrative type.  How, as a picture framer and administrator, he juggles all his balls in the air, and hats he wears, is impressive indeed.  My own hat goes off to him.  An aquaintance of mine (like myself, a picture framer)recommended this book to me, and I'm glad he did. The author speaks in broad enough terms so that you certainly don't need to be a picture framer to apply the valuable lessons he's sharing. Definitely worth reading for anyone at all interested in getting it right in business.  Go Jay 
 I don't have too much to say about Tree Crops---A Permanent Agriculture wrote by J. Russell Smith and the introduction by Wendell Berry.  Its is a summary of tree choices for US lands and there potential roles as a food  source for humans and livestock.  I was most intriuged by the information  on utilizing mulberry trees as an early season feed supply for pigs and  chickens.  I would recommend the book for any sustainable ag fans who are  very willing to think outside the box 
 Excellent book! I understand patents much better..... now I really value the time my patent attorney is spending to create a solid patent! The book gives you enough information to write your own patent, however, I'm choosing to have the attorney do it anyway 
 This story is absolutely fabulous!  The illustrations are great and the book teaches kids about saving money to buy something special.  The child in the story looks at several things and finally deicdes what would be the best present to purchase.  Best of all, most of the money she spends comes from a jar of coins - this is a wonderful follow-up to the equally charming story "A Chair for my Mother" also written by Vera B. Williams 
 the rockets i usually launch go about 1500-3000 feet inthe air so this to wasn't as good ,but then the rockets i like have fire come out of the bottom and are more fun yet the get lost to easy you have to go a big place to luanch them and the engines are sold separtly. Then again this has to do with house old items and is cheaper 
 He's literally the World's Greatest Salesman, who has actually been in the field and achieved great accomplishments in sales himself, vs other gurus who simply do great at selling their books & audiobooks. He's the best, period, and he shares his knowledge with you in this book. cak 
 Quite simply, the finest book I have read covering WW2. Plenty of laughter, plenty of tears, and the burning desire to vividly relive the drama of those days, (and I'm relatively young). Anyone who lived through  it will find old memories rekindled by the scor 
 This is a great book! I read it when I was a young girl, and decided I needed to read it again now that I'm older. It's a wonderful journey through the eyes of a quirky young girl. It's a must read!! 
 In short:  Dennis Pagen has written THE book on paragliding for beginners to intermediate pilots.  This book covers it all.  Clearly illustrated, easy to read.  I use this book as a 'refresher' each season before I begin flying.  He covers all the nuts and bolts of the various topics that make up paragliding, from how to hook your risers to your harness to how to ridge soar.  I have read most of the books out there on paragliding, and this one covers more than all the others combined.  If you are a serious paraglider pilot who wants a good manual for refreshing, or prospective pilot who wants to learn all you can before you begin lessons, this is THE book to buy 
 I own over 50 books on ghosts and the paranormal and this is in the top 3 as being the best, great pictures and first hand accounts 
 Wash up with no problem.  I wear a 7 and a large fits just right 
 In PUBLIC OPINION, we have 1 of the foundational texts in the forming of present day public relations.  According to all I've read on Walter Lippmann, he was the most influential pundit of his era, so to read his assessment of the public's opinion & what it's worth & how it must be tamed, we (the readers) are being given access to the core elements that lead to what we know today as government & business propaganda.  Lippmann was part of the Creel Committee, whose job it was to sell the idea that America should get involved in World War I to the American people...so the importance of peeking into the thought processes behind that campaign of pro-war propaganda is a priceless opportunity.  If you wish to understand what those in power actually think of the public's importance in a democracy (or democratic republic), make sure you read this book...twice 
 I bought this book few months ago and it was interesting to go through it step by step. As a leader the first thing one must learn is how to deal with subordinates. After going through the 8 laws mentioned in Chapter 3: Leading Subordinates, one can imagine how less we focus on the people who are our main assets. A leader's success depends upon the success of his subordinates and these 8 laws are the basis for that success. One need to read each law multiple times so that it gets engrossed in one's heart. The "Performance contract" is a must for everyone to set  clear expectations.   The examples provided in the books are mostly based on author's experience and I found Feiner very sincere in putting them straight. Overall a must for anyone who wants to build lasting relationship with their people 
 The Best Avalanche book I have ever read. I would recommend to pros and novices alike. 
 If you are looking for somekind of a hard rocking halloween CD, don't buy this, because it is actually like soft and funny Broadway musical. This is his most diverse and music varied and has impressed me right after a first listening. Even thought it is very soft and ballad filled, it has some outstanding guitar work by Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter. Just listen to incredible guitar solo on Wish you were here and guitar riffs on Go to hell.  This album has some of the Alice's finest lyrics and humour. The ballads are some of the Cooper's best. I never cry is very touching and Wake me gently is even better. Alice Cooper's vocals are on the top notch and he offers us hard rock gems like Go to hell, Wish you were here, Didn't we meet and guilty. You gotta dance has a disco beat, Give the kid a break is 50's style musical number that would't be totally out of a place on Frank Zappa album and bluesy I'm the coolest is funny as hell.  This album is lyrically clever, very creative and listening this throught is like a good adventure. This is definately one of the best concept albums ever and very underrated. You can almost visualize the whole story from the beginning to the end. If you want tight atmosphere, good humour, excellent guitar work, touching ballads and a good musical in the same package, this album is for you.                  
 After purchasing this book and reading all about myself, I had to share this with my friends, who loved it!  Its easy to understand, and I loved the tie in to the elements, and the little charts that described who love, friendship, and business matches.  Great illustrations throughout.  A fantastic book at a great price! 
 I bought the first copy of this book during my son's elementary school book sale. My son is going to college this fall and I am buying a copy to send with him to school and a few for his friends. It is the most used cookbook in the house. I cannot even count how many I bought over the years 
 Dr. King in this book, gives the background on the successful demonstrations in Birmingham and The  1963 March on Washington. (My father was at that march). Martin gives the insights on his Non -violent Direct Action approach and how it worked in Birmingham. He also explains what he meant in his I have a dream speech. Those who read this book will see that Dr. King favored a approach to bring African-Americans in the Mainstream that is similiar to Affirmative Action. Dr. King's mistakes were he assumed the whites in the North would favor his approach when he came to their neighborhood (Chicago 1966)and that those who favored ending segregation would support spending government money to help poor Blacks. All Americans should read this book 
 A practical guide to the GI index, what it is and how it works - and exceptionally helpful if you're diabeti 
 This was a very good book. It had that certain sadness to it of wanting someone you can't have. It dragged somewhat, but it picked up and had a great ending 
 This movie is one of the best movies i have  ever seen.From gigantic ninjas to naked ninjas(woman subdued the buddhist priest) to the beautiful girl who killed two guys in less then 3 seconds" Ëye for an Eye" damn she can fight!!!!.But i would have loved to see the buddhist priest fight with the ninja priest 
 If you've ever met Randy you will know that he is the Will Rogers of Texas Country Music. He never met a man he didn't like, but has met at least one woman who has broken his heart. Nights on the road playing and partying with some of the most talented artists on the Texas music scene have spawned some incredibly passionate songwriting partnerships on Randy Rogers Band's new CD. Anyone who has done any livin at all can't help but have memories stirred up from this collection of hard hitting songs. From true heart breakers like Whiskey's Got A Hold On Me and If Anyone Asks to sexy songs like You Could Change My Mind and the bedroom ballad Kiss Me In The Dark RRB really gets the blood flowing. Randy belts them out with a haunting honesty that hits deep inside you.  The band's awsome insrumental talents aren't hidden by the over-engineering that clutters many Nashville produced CDs. You Don't Know Me written by bass player Jon Richardson highlights each musician's incredible talent as the music drifts from one solo to the next. I can listen to RRBs music over and over, it just doesn't get old. Think this aint true Texas music? Don't just listen to the music, go see Randy and the guys when they come to town. Get close and let it sink into your skin like mesquite smoke from a campfire on a hot Hill Country night.     
 Nice if used as a MP3 player stand alone. When using the included  indoor/outdoor antenna with the home stand, forget it. The antenna does not pick up the signal very good inside or outside the home. A better antenna and this would be a sweet product with all its capabilities. Great stand alone MP3 Player. Samsung products I look at first and usually buy 
 Ilan Pappe is a courageous Israeli academic who also happens to be a superb archival sleuth. This is the best revisionist history of the roots of the Zionist, apartheid state and the catastrophic trail of tears which the Zionists have inflicted on the native Palestinians. The mythology has it that the Israeli enterprise started out as a humanitartian beacon of light to the world, and only afterward slowly devolved into the current ZionNazi entity. Prof. Pappe offers impressive archival evidence to demonstrate that, from its inception, the Israeli state was predicated upon war crimes and racist extirpation of the indigenous Palestinians. "The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine" is a powerful refutation of Israeli hasbara and a dossier that makes the case that, far from being a "haven for 'Holocaust' survivors," the Israeli state is a machine for holocausting Palestinians as an expression of its founding ideology. 
 I think this is a wonderful book.  I have not read it but even the title pulls you in.  The reason I am writing about this book is because I love slave stories.  I have read other books by this author and I think she is awesome.  This book is on my wish list and i hope to get it soo 
 There's more talent in these four guys hands that the top 100 Pop bands put together. These are true artists. Being an early release in the DVD-A realm the production could have been a little better but the talent, from a musican's point of view, quickly makes the point moot. Anyone that would like to see genius at work should buy one of their DVD's and sit back and watch. in fact any of the GRP guys will show the same artistic value at work. To the reviewer that thought of it as ultra smooth jazz...that's ok. Choice of style should be as free as any other choice. I would still reccomend to check them out in a video performance. Might enlighten you somewhat.. Just a suggestion. Now since Amazon has given up on DVD-A and you cant buy it here doesnt mean it cant be found for around $15 elsewhere which brings up the point of the idiot trying to sell it used for $79.99. Are you nuts. Just what do you think you have?  Google/froogle and get it new for 15 bucks and boycott these rip-off artists trying io sell it for 5 times it's value. $79.99...one would have to be nuts to pay that. Perfect example of what gives used CD sellers bad names. Anyway, enjoy the music and catch a GRP live performance. Cant go wrong Lee Ritenour has a newish DVD in 5.1 out that shows what a real band with talent should sound like. $79.99...I cant get over it ...it's so far out there funny. Enjoy 
 I recommend The Field for people with an open and inquisitive mind. The research described shouldn't be taken as physical law (yet), but it gives unique potential for understanding the interconnectedness of humanity. It is simply fascinating.  My only critique: McTaggart seems too willing to accept the research as definitive from time to time. Overall, though, she is pretty good about maintaining balanced skepticism 
 I was very impressed the free shipping'''The time it took to get to me'''And the quality i got for the best price on the internet'''This is the best shopping network in the whole entire internet 'Honestly'''' 
 I have never had anyone ask me about a business book that I was reading until I laid this one down on an airplane seat next to me. I have had 2 or 3 people ask me about the title, etc. It is entrancing and compelling! I personally found the subject to be thought provoking and timely, and it ought to be of staggering significance to companies that really care about their destiny and those of stakeholders in these very complex times 
 As a husband with two children, this book is outstanding in providing a way to execute Covey's concept of making deposits into the emotional bank accounts of those you care very deeply for.  I read the book years ago and still find it has great value. 
 This book was excellent.  We used this book for a discussion with a youth group.  The young ladies enjoyed all the stories.  They could relate to the young people in the stories.  It gave them a picture of how girls see themselves and how boys and men around them view them.  I enjoyed reading the book and I was excited to discuss it with them.  I would encourage young and old to read this book 
 This is an excellent addition to the Reacher series.  Reacher is relying more on guile than violence these days, and this outing requires his inflicting only some broken bones and I believe four fatalities.  The plot is nicely convoluted, although a clever reader will early on suspect that all is not as it seems.  The characters are well developed, and the major locales -- New York and rural England -- are evoked more than adequately.  Lee Child's work is definitely a cut or two above the field in all respects, with the writing quality more than high enough not to present distractions from the story.  
 Senator Ben Tillman of South Carolina rose to the heights of power in the United States on a record of racial murder, political demogoguery and aristocratic deceit.  His political career, documented here with  painstaking research and brilliant prose, did a great deal to mark the  world we inhabit.  This is a book about the political project of white  supremacy, about how rich and powerful white men persuaded poor and angry  white men that it was African Americans, not wealthy whites, who  constituted the central threat to their families and their fates.  "Pitchfork Ben," Kantrowitz proves, was not a populist or a  tribune of the common man, but a terrorist, an organizer, a tyrant and a  bully.  This beautifully-written biography grabbed my attention from the  first page and continually surprised me with its revelations about race and  American politics.  The central figure is a despot and the story is tragic,  and yet this wonderful work of history manages to inspire the reader and to  remind us of the best possibilities of American democracy.  This  masterpiece about race and democracy in the late nineteenth and early  twentieth centuries also speaks to persistent and disturbing realities in  the  contemporary world.  U.S history at its best--a rewarding and  absorbing piece of writing 
 I'm sorry, but i have a slight hearing deficit.  I purchased all the miss marples that are out there, and I enjoy these the most.  The Briish accent for me is a little difficult to decifer on the others.  And these have a comedic ring that i enjoy 
 Daniel Johnston and Jad Fair, along with unknown newcomer Chris Bultman, have made the noisest (mostly) accoustic album in recent memory.  This is a very, very good thing.  Not exactly picking up where the savant genious of their "It's Spooky" left off, "Somewhat Humorous" explores a realm of music left untouched by even the most extreme fringe of independent artists.  From their straightforward-but-not-straightforward retooling of "Ruby Tuesday" to the beautiful background clatter of "Pancakes Flop" and the cute-punk sneer of "She Starts Fire", there's a reward to be found at every turn.  Reportedly written and recorded during a stay in Daniel's parents garage in the middle of the country, the music found on this CD sounds as if chaos, heartbreak, and winsomeness are added to the local water supply.  Buy this before it goes down in the indie-rock history books 
 BDP is one of the best. This album shows that. All the songs are good. KRS ONE has made a career with the last two albums, but this one says it all. It actually is The Blueprint. Favorites include Style You Haven't Done Yet, Blueprint, Jack of Spades, Breath Control, Hip Hop Rules,  Bo! Bo! Bo!, and  Ghetto Music. A true Hip Hop Classic. Recommended with the rest of their albums. 
 It is unfortunate that Henry David Thoreau experience little renown in his lifetime, but I am glad to see that he is now recognized as one of the leading lights of American political philosophy, as he well deserves to be. His writings, which have influenced everyone from Martin Luther King Jr. to Ghandi to Robert A. Heinlein to Don Henley, are the very essence of the strength of invididualism and freedom of the spirit. Thoreau was vehemently against slavery (his two essays on the subject in this volume are so passionate that they may move you to tears), and the title essay is, of course, a classic in itself. Distilling the virtues of conscience over the mere created laws of man, Thoreau makes a very good case here for self-government, and I am surprised he is not more frequently cited by the Liberterian movement. His remembrance of when he spent a night in jail for refusing to pay his poll tax - in which he says he felt that the prison walls did not confine him, that he felt more free than ever inside them, that he came to feel sorry for the state and even pity them for resorting to such measures, and that he, in fact, felt like he was the only citizen who did pay his poll tax - I find truly inspiring. They just don't make men like that, anymore. While many of us may find it hard to be so idealistic about things, we are reminded, in reading this, of a time when people could - and did - truly die for what they believed in. One wonders what Thoreau would think of present-day America. Life Without Principle is another eye-opening piece, in which Thoreau condemns the American social system and job ladder. Walking is a classic that is still cited by conservationists everywhere, and that helped in a big way in the U.S.'s national parks movement. Seminal American writing in the tradition of Thomas Paine, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and other great American thinkers 
 I was a little hesitant about the whole open adoption situation, until I read this book.  It really helped me to understand how open adoptiongs work.  This is a well written and practical book.  If you only read one book on open adoption, read this one 
 At the time, white was the only option.  Red would have pleased my child more.  I've found SP games which claim to work with the wireless attachement, do NOT work (communicate) with DS games.    But as for the DS Lite, its a reasonable size, perhaps slightly larger buttons would be nicer.  Now they offer Pink and Black, which is nice, but exchangable covers would have been nice.  The stylus is just barely managable for Adult hands but work fine for my child.  The screens are bright and no longer dimmable (backlighting could be turned off in the SP.  One nice feature is many games allow some amout of co-play with another DS, even if your partner doesn't have a copy.  Stores like "GameStop" often have kiosks that allow you to download demos of different games.  Thats nice but you cannot keep the demo thru a power cycle, so that's a bummer.    The biggest pain yet is I have not found a cable to communicate between the DS Lite and the SP (one does exist for the DS to SP).  Oh, an the power supply cable is different as well.  So, while less bulky and better layout, the DS Lite steps you even further away from the accessories which worked between SP and DS (first versions, not Lite).  Such is the proprietary way.    I'd really like to see more adult software for these things.  They are not far from a PDA with their audio recognition and handwriting as well 
 This is real Italian espresso ,the best you can find on the market. If you have an espresso machine and know how to use it then you got it made...Rich flavor and sweet at the same time ...I've known this product all my life growing in italy ...Excellent ...The very best 
 MULHOLLAND DRIVE is one of the greatest movies of the last 30 years. Utterly compelling. First time I watched it, mesmerized but without really understanding it, the whole audience at the movie theater was speechless at the end, completely blown away. Naomi Watts gives one of the greatest performances of all time. Her character goes through the most amazing changes, all utterly convincing. Her "movie audition" is especially stunning. MULHOLLAND DRIVE is confusing the first time through, but after watching it a couple of times it all comes together. Unlike, for example, LOST HIGHWAY, this is a completely realistic plot, with no supernatural or unexplainable elements. Originally this was a pilot for a TV show a la Twin Peaks. Lynch then changed it to make it a movie, so there are some loose ends. There are also some lengthly dream sequences (Lynch gives only subtle clues to tell us that what's dream and real, but there are clues, and the distinction is clear), some flashbacks which are out of order, and some psychotic delusions presented from the perspective of the psychotic person. Nevertheless, the events are all completely possible (dreams do happen, people are subject to psychotic delusions, and memories or flashbacks can happen out of order), even plausible. Lynch gives us a terrifying look into the human psyche 
 This is one of those books that makes your hair stand up on your neck. Saw the author on C-SPAN during a recent book blitz with some of the best authors that caused me to make a huge order with Aamzon.com.    Now I had known some about eugenics and forced sterilization and the role Margaret Sanger and others played, but this book was a major eye opener.  In it one discovers that forced sterilization was something aimed at white women until the very end of its run, and that California and not some state like Mississippi, Alabama etc had the highest numbers of forced sterilization.    That epilepsy was a medical condition they said required sterilization, even though we now know and have for decades that its a treatable condition and one that even people with exceptionally high IQ's can have, often a result of an accident NOT genetics.  And for those who have thought that Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was the most brilliant jurist in American history, think again, when one reads that he fully supported forced sterilization as did New England Protestants whom the writer notes 'had been obsessed by the character of the nation'.  'In universities like Yale and Harvard, a theology of divine election was giving way to a theory of race that idealized the ancestry of the Nordics, and in particular the Germanic Anglo-Saxons'.  The author also shares that on December 1945 during the Nuremberg war trials against the Nazis that one would find out that it was the United States' laws requiring forced sterilization that had been copied by the Nazis.  That it was the United States that they were emulating no matter how much they hated us.  Interestingly many of the same medical professionals who believed in and practiced forced sterilization on those who were considered inferior medically would have their view come home to haunt them. Both when they themselves developed medical conditions that had led to the sterilization of others or as in the case of Charles Davenport whose young son Charlie Jr succumbed to polio in 1916.   On page 85 one reads ' It is the first step with farmers and gardeners to endeavor to obtain good breeds of domestic animals and sedulously to cultivate plants, for it pays them well to do so' said a young student named Francis Galton from Cambrige University who lived during Queen Victoria's time.   The information on John H. Kellogg is facinating. Not just the part of his founding the Kellogg cereal company but his support of sterilization and other eugenic thought.    Its a book I couldn't put down and one I am about to re-read because I am sure there are things I missed.   It also forced me to face my views on eugenics which I have mixed feelings on.  Mainly because I think someone who is so mentally retarded as to not know how to avoid or protect themselves from pregnancy, might benefit in a humane way by being sterilized.  Its an issue I question a lot.  The author ends by writing 'As human beings enter this new era considering the stunning promises of science and technology, as they contemplate the possibilities of directing their evolution and moving toward a more perfect state of being, the history of forced sterilization and Americas quest for racial purity is worth remembering.'  Interestingly I think of who would they want sterilized today were these laws still in effect.  Sure someone might say Anna Nicole Smith or a Paris Hilton.  But in reality I fear it would be people like Dr Stephen Hawking or the science whiz in school who happens to have epilepsy 
 I got this for my parents, who are opera fans and know classical music, and they really enjoyed this book 
 I'm very picky about books that deal with the relationship between physics and consciousness, but this one I like. In books of this sort, the understanding of physics is often too limited, while on the other hand there is frequently very little appreciation for the depth of ancient metaphysical traditions. This book does a very good job of working with both sides in a highly intelligent yet readable manner.  For anyone into Hermeticism or Kabbalah, it is especially noteworthy that Wolf has organized a signfiicant portion of his book around an esoteric understanding of the Herbrew letter-numbers. The particular system he uses was developed by Carlo Suares, a little known yet influential mystic, author, artist and somewhat unorthodox Jewish Kabbalist. Wolf met Suares and began learning about his ideas in the 1970s. Suares' greatest contribution to Kabbalah was an interpretation of the letter-numbers as representations of recurring dynamics and patterns in terms of both consciousness and physics. Suares' book, The Cypher of Genesis, would be a good introduction to his theory and practice of Kabbalah, and an excellent companion to Mind into Matter.  Of course, Wolf's own qualifications in theoretical physics are well established. For more than two decades he has been a consistent leader in challenging the long worn-out mindset that existence is best experienced, explored and explained as essentially an accidental and random interaction of quanta. In this book Wolf allows himself to dive a little deeper into the spiritual implications of his work. Perhaps the best thing about Wolf's writing is that it is more than scientifically sound and philosophically poignant, it is actually inspiring literature! Wolf artfully weaves together insights from a wonderful scope of human inquiry - physics, depth psychology, mysticism, and alchemy - in a way that is head and shoulders above the slipshod speculations common to authors of the "New Age" genre.   Fred Alan Wolf's works will stand the test of time, and this one should be included among his essential readings 
 I have always loved Johnny Cash. He is defitnetly the best country music singer there ever was. This CD is an absoulutely perfectly done collection in honor of the artist's 70th birthday. It has all of his best songs,(but where's rusty cage?) From I Walk The Line to The Wanderer with U2. A great reprersentation of Cash's career. Buy this CD, you won't regret it 
 My 6 year old son loves listening to these stories on CD during quiet time. Each book is like a history lesson in story form, so he has picked up quite a few interesting facts, much to my delight.  Mary Pope Osborne reads these stories in a straighforward manner, with little drama and few voice changes for different characters, but my son really enjoys them, and requests them often.  We have purchased several more in the series, and have been very pleased with them 
 I should have read this book before traveling to Israel.  Donna Rosenthal is a skilled writer and her antecdotes are often hilarious.  Read "From Beirut to Jerusalem" for the politics and the views of the leaders, but read "The Israelis" to understand the opinions of everyday Israelis and to get a glimpse of what to expect when you're actually there.  It's well worth a read. 
 Renovating Becky Miller by Sharon Hinck is an entertaining look into the life of a multi-tasker sure she can do it all and fix it all. You will laugh and angst and maybe even cry as you read this book. There could be times you wonder if Sharon actually peeked in your windows as she researched this book.   . . . Becky Miller is wife of Kevin, mother of  three, leader of the women's ministry at church, housewife, fixer and daydreamer. She tries not to even let the pain in her leg and cane she must use for walking slow her down.   	Becky goes out of her way to work for the church ministries and help anyone who seeks help. She can see the solution to all of the problems around her. But when her sister and mother-in-law both end up living with them in their new fixer-upper home she cannot find the way to fix them or herself. 	The love between she and Kevin is strained by the finances of renovation, the stress of extra family members in the house and small miscommunications between the two of them. Little things start adding up. And it is not until Becky realizes that she cannot do it all, and turns things over to God that He steps in and works His own perfect renovations . . .   	Within the pages of this book you may recognize yourself , your mother, your sister or wife. Life circumstances are real and for many of us almost a bit too close to home. This is a humorous, poignant look at marriage and motherhood.  But more than that is the grace-filled truth of the beauty that God sees in each of us despite our faults and the way His Hands will `fix' all of our circumstances. Clear you calendar, because when you travel to this suburb of Minneapolis, you will not leave until you close the book.  
 Energy.  What a great vibe.  The audience on this live album is having a time of their lives.  The chemistry is just as good as it gets on this record.  One reviewer called this a "challenging" listen.  To find it "challenging" would mean to ignore the feeling - to ignore the feeling is to cease living.  This album is so charged they'll just come and get you, you don't have to do a thing 
 next friday was so much better than the first one. with much more funnier scenes. and this movie is reccommended for everyone 
 I knew next to nothing about Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life except that he was executed for involvement in a plot against Hitler. This film will fill in many of the gaps about Bonhoeffer's life, friends and mission.  Bonhoffer was one of a minority of German theologians who opposed Hitler's rise to power. Other churchmen retreated into conformity, cut their own deals with Hitler or were active in The Reich Church. There's nothing like a Christmas tree topped with a lighted swastika to drive home the reality of how far the Church would bend to accommodate the Nazis. This image, along with those of Hitler at rallies and posing with church leaders, are appalling but instructive  Director Martin Doblmeier interviewed Bonhoeffer's students, friends and relatives to make this moving film. The film takes us from Germany to Harlem, New York, where Bonhoeffer was bowled over by the ecstatic worship of black Americans. He later tied their religious spirit, nurtured in oppression, with that of the Jews of Germany. The film also tries to depict Bonhoeffer's struggle with the use of violence in the cause of good. Whether he made the right choice under his circumstances is a question that each must answer for themselves.  The film was shot on location in Germany, including the cell in which Bonhoeffer spent his final days. The extras include an interview with Doblmeier, who explains that his mission was not just to make a film, but to capture for posterity the memories of the living members of the Bonhoeffer circle.  Deeply affecting and challenging, especially to strict pacifists and to those who equate the gospel with their brand of nationalism 
 It was in the last year of the Second World War, while serving together as part of a tank crew, that Archie Jones met Samad Iqbal. What resulted is a powerful but wacky bond between the hapless but easy going Englishman and the better educated, but always underemployed and bitter, Bengali Muslim. This close friendship also brought together their wives: Alsana, who was promised by her family at birth to marry Samad, and Clara, an extremely beautiful Jamaican girl from a Jehovah's Witness family, whose one flaw is that she has no upper front teeth. 18 years old Clara married the much older Archie soon after meeting the middle-aged man at a hippie New Year's Eve party she was attending. Archie crashed the party after deciding not to go through with a suicide over his failed marriage to his Italian warbride.   Naturally affected by the conflictive and dysfunctional marriages of these two couples are their children. Irie, the only child of Archie and Clara, is an intelligent and pretty girl, unfortunately insecure not only about her weight but also for the kinky hair she's inherited from her black mother. Irie has long been infatuated with one of Samad's twin sons, Millat, who has always been attracted to white women with long straight hair. Millat and his twin, Magid, are handsome like their father. Samad, however, was hypocritically displeased over the way the boys were growing up in 1970s Britain. Whereas Samad has always been joined at the hip of his English best friend (with whom he indulges in drink and an occasional dish of pork), and, at the time, was having an affair with his sons' red-headed English music teacher, he wanted his sons to be brought up as good Muslims, praying five times a day, eating halal food and all the rest. His solution was to send them to be raised in his native Bangladesh. Arranging this behind his wife's back, he found that he could afford to send only one of the boys. He chose the more intellectually gifted, and older by two minutes, Magid. Ironically it is this son who will grow into an atheist, loving all things English, while Millat, who remained behind in the UK, will eventually become involved with a radical Islamist group. Adding more into this already bizarre interracial and multicultural mix, Irie and Millat bring their fellow student, Joshua Chalfen, and his pretentiously intellectual, secular Jewish family --a brood that is overbearing and more dysfunctional than either the Joneses or the Iqbals could ever be-- into everyone's lives.  All parties will eventually clash over the genetic engineering experiments of Josh Chalfen's father. Clara's Jehovah's Witness mother and ex-boyfriend, Millat's radical Muslim organization, all agree on one thing only: that Professor Chalfen is evil incarnate. Even his son Josh, who has become involved with a fanatical animal rights group, repudiates both him and his work. Only Magid, returning to his beloved England, is enamored with Professor Chalfen and his research.  Zadie Smith was only 24 when she wrote WHITE TEETH. Herself the child of a black mother and white father, Smith had based much of the novel's storyline and characters from her own life's experiences (Interestlingly, the characters of Magid and Millat are based on real-life brothers Zia and Jimmi Rahman, Zia being the ex-boyfriend of writer Claire Berlinski [LOOSE LIPS, MENACE IN EUROPE]). Along with a knack for fueling the narrative, Smith also possesses that rare talent for putting the conversational --with all of its strange vernaculars and colloquialisms-- to print. The characters who populate her story, despite their wildest eccentricities and convoluted personalites, are realistic and attractive, easily provoking sympathy. WHITE TEETH is one of the few books that a reader hates to put down and can't wait to pick up again with any bit of free time he or she gets.   There are, however, two things that I didn't like about WHITE TEETH: One is the way that Smith downplayed the racial tensions and often violent confrontations between the Indian and black immigrants and the white working class community in 1960s-1980s Britain. After all, at the time Samad is supposed to have moved to the UK (1975), so-called "Paki bashing" was still a common, late night pastime for many of England's white youth subcultures ('skinheads,' 'bootboys,' and other football hooligans, as well as the perrenial 'teddy boys'). The children, growing up in early-to-mid '80s London, not once encountered anything of the skinhead resurgence of that time, or the rise in popularity amongst white youth for the fascistic National Front or British Movement organizations. The Riots of 1981, which plagued the British Isles for weeks, aren't even mentioned. The other thing that displeased me about the story was the ending. I agree some of the other reviewers here that it did seem rushed. 
 This is a awsome book but you really need to read the first book before you read this one.  I hope there is going to be third book in series 
 I love the fact that it is the eaziest to set, dual alarm clock to date. all you do is hit one button amd turn the knob! The quality shows in its wieght and the feel of the controls. Sound quality is great also. I is the best  alarm clock I have ever owne 
 Living In Hell by Ghazal Omid is an Odyssey Of A Life Time: into the jaws of hell and back to the hope of love.    Very few individuals  in a series of lifetimes will ever experience the level of personal, emotional and physical suffering that has haunted the life of Ghazal Omid.  Knowledge unused turns into inaction developing into action aiding all those ruled by despots.  Upon reading "Living In Hell" each of us carries a responsibility to act upon the recognition of this young woman's trials to reach out to all yet left behind in the grasp of tyranny 
 This book does have a Christian slant but I don't know why anyone would get so up in arms about that.  I mean c'mon--when ever you are buying something based on someone else's opinions there are going to be things that you don't agree with.  She doesn't make her point of view any big secret.   The point with this book and the reason that I really enjoy it is that she gives you not only her opinions on her Top 100 favs but she also organizes her choices into a helpful, quick-reference, grid format and also a more in depth format as well.  She also gives you info on how to determine your child's learning style as well as your own.  Plus, she gives you a basic run down on differing educational philosophies so that you know which curriculums are going to fit into your teaching/learning philosophy and you and your child's learning style.  In layman's terms, it doesn't do me a hill of beans to by a highly recommended phonics curriculum for a 'perfect Paula' if what I have at home is a 'wiggly Willy.'  She breaks it down very well.   The other proof I have with this book is that I have yet to be disappointed in any of the curriculums I have chosen based on her opinions.  To me, that's the biggest endorsement I could make.  
 Ably translated into English by Jeffrey Hopkins, The Meaning Of Life: Buddhist Perspectives On Cause And Effect was written by His Holiness, The Dali Lama for people seeking to develop a deeper understanding of Buddhist perspectives on existential questions of meaning, purpose, and responsibility. Basing his commentary on the Buddha's teachings of dependent arising, The Dali Lama reveals how every aspect of our suffering (unhappiness, pain, old age, death) is ultimately rooted in our misunderstanding of our own true nature. The Dali Lama infuses his text with the intelligence, wit, kindness and compassion he is so well known for within the Buddhist community world wide 
 We just saw the wonderful movie and picked up the game on the way home.  I'm 39 years old and terrible at games.  This game is sweet and lots of fun.  Food fights, soccer, searching for things.  If I can do it anyone can.  Merry Christmas one and all 
 It's been years since I've read aloud from this wonderful anthology to my twin sons who are now 16. But they still remember vibrant, lively selections like "Half a league, half a league, half a league onward ... " (The Charge of the Light Brigade) and "The Ransom of Red Chief" (which they loved but didn't really "get" until they were about 13). I credit this wonderful book with providing truly excellent literature to feed their hungry young brains. This book is part of their current success in school and life! BUY IT for your child or grandchild - or donate it to your local school library 
 I had saw an ad for City Life and I clicked it. I read about it and thought it sounded so much better than Sim City 4 (which I currently own) that I decided to download and try the demo. The demo was so much fun, and it had many features. What gives this game a unique twist is the social cliques. You have to meet the needs of each cliques, for example the different types of jobs they need. What makes it realistic, is it is just like real life. The blue collars dont want to live next to the fringes, whereas the rich don't want to live next to the poor, or homeless. What supprised me the most about this game though was the 3d graphics. You can zoom in and out and get eye level with the "people" You can see them reading the paper on their picnic table in their backyard, or walking down the street, or taking the trash out. Another neat feature is how easy it is to zone. The zoning is such an improvement over SC4. This game makes you auctually have to get involved with your community, making it your perfect town. Now all I am waiting for is my copy of the game to come in.  1- least...........................10-best  Graphics: 8 Simplicity: 9 Fun: 10 Realistic: 9  Overall a great game for those who are tired of waiting for SC5 or, for those who are just starting out with city simulation games 
 The flowing language and engaging text and illustrations encouraged my 6 year old son to try to read this "all by himself".  Unlike many "early reader" books, the language is not awkward, and the  repetitions are very natural.  A pleasure 
 This book should have been more appropriately titled HOW TO WATCH A SEED GROW. Instead of discussing the various stages of development and explaining what happens, the book is basically an extended science project explaining how students can watch a seed grow into a plant. The book talks about the different stages, but only discusses what the planted beans should look like in those stages, not really explaining what is happening or why. Nevertheless, the book does outline a good science project for younger children, but isn't much as a book to read to kids 
 The first half of this novel was originally published in book form in 1966 under the title The Unteleported Man. Dick expanded the novel, and its presently published form as Lies, Inc. (2004 edition), represents his intentions for its final form. The first half was a fairly routine political intrigue set in a world where much of Earth's population is emigrating via teleportation to a distant planet. The second half has only a tenuous relationship to what proceeded it and is the most bizarre piece of writing that Dick ever produced. It is an account of what happens to the main character when he gets hit by an LSD dart: he experiences a series of psychedelic "paraworlds," or different classes of hallucinated realities experienced in altered states of consciousness. This second half spins so far out of both the author's and the reader's control that the sense of objective reality dissolves altogether. We are immersed in total insanity. So it becomes a trip in a very real sense-but forget about any satisfaction from the artistic unity or structure. There isn't any 
 Bob Seger has been a constant force in the music industry for years.  This lastest album has some really powerful lyrics and great songs.  Would highly recommend this album to any other Seger fans 
 James Cannon is a gifted story teller. Whether you're religious or not, you'll appreciate the power of a great story, and that's what "Apostle Paul" is -- a great story. The reader will walk as if in Paul's footsteps, from his disbelief in the Word to acceptance. You can actually feel what it was like to share Paul's exuberance for the Son of Man. Who can forget the moment when God blinds a doubting Paul, and then makes him see again? All of us have had similar experiences, where we've been blinded by mistrust and ambiguity, only to awaken to the light.I recommend James Cannon's terrific work to anyone who has ever crossed that threshold.     
 I'm 13, and i haven't yet experienced "it."  Well Girl Stuff helped me with those tough issues that are hard to discuss with my parents.  Like every time my mom confronts me and tries to talk, I ignore her and don't give very good answers.  This book helped me "open up" to my mom, and now I’m more comfortable with my body.  I usually don’t like talking about issues regarding my body, and personal stuff, but “girl stuff” helped me feel ordinary.  I really appreciate the way the authors didn't just talk about the issues that every girl needs to know about, they also helped me understand them, and describing them in depth helped me be informed, and I am totally ready for anything that comes my way.  THIS BOOK IS A TOTALL MUST HAVE FOR ANY TEEN 
 Lots of info and casting #'s with dates. Nice to have 85% of info all in 1 easy to find book.  
 a beautiful set of songs arrnged and performed with power, emotion and sensitivity 
 In the beginning, Ronnie Tremayne keeps telling herself she loves her body, while at the same time showing the discomfort and embarrassment she feels at being overweight.  She also admits to being unhappy for so long it felt normal to her.  Apparently in danger of losing her job because of her size, she contradicts Oprah's comment that "the key to happiness is loving yourself, and self-love comes from within" with her own belief that "The key to happiness is living in a world where fat is beautiful."  And that's what Ronnie wakes up to the next day--not all at once--it takes a while for her to realize why everyone is acting in an unusual manner.  But there it is--a world where fat is not only beautiful but is a state to be worked toward and hoped for.  The concept of this book is original and thought-provoking.  And the story becomes more so as Ronnie adjusts so well to her new world that she ends up losing her appetite.  Living in a world where fat is considered beautiful, she'd been given permission to eat, something she'd been denied throughout her life by her mother and by herself.  I don't want to give away the ending of this well-written, imaginative, most enjoyable book, so I'll just give a hint.  On page 358, Ronnie tells a friend, "What you see is what you get.  If you don't like it, well, that's not my problem. 
 I think Frantzen is downright scary! Not only does he write our inner worlds so accurately, most people hate him and his books... but he also seems to know our outer world in an eerily perceptive way. Just read the pages describing a "decadent people's" response to a catastrophe, and there you are in our 9/11 reality. Those pages gave me goosebumps. And then, a few pages on, we watch all the monsters who created a financial and environmental disaster, skip away with their millions. Hmmmm...is he not only damn talented with words, with deep, deep understanding of what people really are, of what love is, what sacrifice is, but also what our corrupt society is. Frankly, I keep being amazed, and I can't wait to read everything he's written. Is it possible that readers become so upset with him because he's bringing literature to a new realm? A realm we may not be ready for? A realm we're not comforable with because it's so much less "arty"--despite his beauty with words, but so much more real. No his characters are not likeable--are we, when we're all naked and confused and scared and selfish? I don't think so. But they--with only one or two exceptions in his books--are loveable. We come to know his characters the way God must. From the inside, where, with all the ugliness and flaws, there is grace and beauty. And ultimately, for all the satire, the irony, the cynicism, these books are rich in hope, in redemption, in grace. Damn this is a writer who Knows Something 
 I purchased this book to try to get some insight into what a friend of mine was going through after she was diagnosed with cancer. The book was great and very entertaining, as well as letting me know a little about what my friend was going through. I also live in the New York area so I could relate to the book as I have eaten at Da Silvano many times. I appreciated Marisa's openness and frankness about what she was going through, and can relate to how your perspective on life changes when cancer rears it ugly head. The illustrations were perfect and I finished the book in two days 
 I had always been ashamed of my secret wants in intimate relationships--now I understand why I have them, what they mean and most importantly I no longer feel the shame I associated with them.  AROUSAL should be required reading before someone starts dating or enters a sexual relationship.  I wish I had this guide in college 
 I've grown a great respesct for Sub City as of late... they're one of the few record labels out there that aren't about just making muisc.  making music is great, but making it with a purpose is even better.  If you thought you'd get a better circle of musicians together, you were wrong when you bought this comp.  It's not the BEST Sub City take action comp, but it features so many good bands that if you never heard the original Take Action compilation you'd have thought so.  This compilation single-handedly turned me back to punk rock, and even though it's a little poppier than my original punk tastes, it gave me a broader view of what good punk can be.  And this is good punk rock 
 This is a very well researched book about the history of charter fishing off Hatteras Island. The author combines archive research with annecdotes collected from his repeated trips to the island. The reader also has a feeling of sadness as the author's wife slowly succumbs to MS while he is doing his research.  Well worth the time to read 
 A must have book for all Versace fans 
 it may sound pompous, but if you haven't spent a good 15+ hours with this book, you do not know how to fully digest, think, learn, and read.  I am currently working on the book. it is enlightening.  the title was a horrible marketing scheme, but maybe the author was not so worried about this.  if you read for more than an average of 10 minutes a day, if you read any books at all, this is the book to read.  I'm sorry, but your own damn college professors need to read this.  In fact, I have found no other even closely imitable work.  It is head and shoulders above.  If you question your profs.  There is good reason to.  It is a tragedy that this book is not taught in freshman year in college, or highschool... in fact, all of highschool lit. should just teach this work alone.  One cannot accurately read without it.  I know i sound over the top, and, it is just a matter of opinion that you won't be able to read like a champ w/o this, however, i stand by this firmly.  If you wonder why you can't think truly creatively, if you wonder how others spend a lifetime reading, then this is worth skimming.  If you are truly motivated to read this book, don't be taken a back by its demands.  It is exhaustive.  It will take a lot of time to consume and understand.  However, that process will add to all your reading latter to it.      The only problems with the book are with it's structure and lack of prefacing its inclination towards reading expository works.  It doesn't address the difference of books early enough in my own opinion.  For one may be a literature reader before reading and take his rules towards expository works towards lit. and be confused in the end.    If you read it, apply  his own damn rules of reading to his own book, otherwise you will short change yourself.  i will say again, it is exhausting, but your mind will grow.   It will change your mind on intelligence being mostly nature, for, nuture definatly has a factor.  I'd give it 4.5 if i could, because it is not a 'perfect' book for reasons mentioned above.  however, it deserves five just as well 
 Ramos-Zayas delves into topics that are crucial to  ethnographic research. She explores the performance of Puerto Ricans and critiques the social inequalities perpetrated against barrio residents 
 How to Win Friends etc. will probably always outsell this one. But the former book you can always practice with your family, neighbors and co-workers one at a time. With "The Quick Easy Way to Effective Speaking" you have to face the crowd, which is more difficult. This book seems to be an updated revision of a book on public speaking by Mr. Carnegie which was written long before. Dale Carnegie died in 1955, and for the previous 40 years of his life, through his classes and through his writings, he was a great courage teacher for the average person, and his spirit still flows strongly through his books 
 Black Rose by Nora Roberts is a romance mystery novel. This is the second novel of the series about three women who are living in a old mansion who are trying to solve the mystery of the Ghost who roams the property. In this novel Roz (the owner of the mansion and garden business) finds love and more peices of the Ghost puzzle. She has to stand up to her ex-husband and those parts are very enjoyable. I would buy all three novels and enjoy - I am! 
 I really like the way Ellen Hopkins writes. Her stories are so realistic and I especially like the fact that she does not end them like fairy tales. Life can be difficult and living through it can be no small task. I thank you, Ms. Hopkins for telling your stories in such a truthful way 
 seeing that this is such a small book (barely 100 pages of text), i was surprised at the depth of this book. as one reviewer wrote, it does not get into specifics about his life ('journeys' by allen shawn is good for that), but it gets into enough. i was especially pleased with the musical analysis of schoenberg's music that was presented here, which those who understand music can appreciate; such is left out of many musical biographies that i have read, and that is why i appreciate it here. it does lend a tremendous assistance in understanding his music, and his working philosophy. (that said, though, it might mean that this isnt the book for you if you dont want to get into theory; again, shawn's book is an excellent alternative then.)in fact, after reading this, i started to read schoenberg's writings on music theory, which ifound enlightening. 
 I loved this book, read it in one day.  It gives a wonderful overview of investing in areas of the market that are less frequently travelled, Spin-offs, merger securities, etc.    Greenblatt details why investing in these market niches has tended to work in the past and why he believes it will continue to do so in the future.  Perhaps more important than the speicific areas he suggest the investor investigate is the methodology he suggests.  In a nutshell, Greenblatt suggests that the investor search for investments in underfollowed areas of the market where he can develop an informational advantage.  I think this is very sound advice for someone willing to put in some effort.  This approach also requires a knowledge of finance, you must be able to read and understand SEC filings and be able to understand financial statement.  If you are a passive mutual fund investor or a financial novice not willing to put forth the effort to learn this approach is definately not for you.  I found the writing engaging and the material inspirational 
 I own this movie and I can never get tired of it. I know all the lines.  
 In this lucid and eloquently written book, Orsi places the Madonna of 115th Street into the full context of the Italian Harlem community.  I found the most interesting part of this extrememly insightful book to be Orsi's examination of the Italian-American domus, and how the complexities of the domus are played out in the festival itself.  The book is a brilliant examination of the role of women in Italian Harlem; Orsi shows how the Madonna embodies both the power and restrictions of Italian-American women in this time.  Orsi also effectively demonstrates how the Italian immigrants, with their annual festival, carved out an identity "niche" for themselves, apart from but no less legitimate than other immigrant groups and other, more church-oriented forms of Catholicism.  For the Italian immigrants, the festival provided both an essential link to Italy and a way to define their particular community.  This book is easily accessible to scholars, students, and the general public, and includes many interviews so the reader gets a vivid sense of the period and the people of Italian Harlem.  Highly recommended 
 After an astonishing effort from Hammerfall in their 2005 release, "Chapter V," the band stays true to form on "Threshold." There's alot of clean metal sound in this album, as well as some fast and furious guitar licks.   The album opens with the ferocious title track, and only slows down a bit in track 3, "rebel inside", just to pound the riffs out again in the middle of the song.  To find a more definitive "Metal" band out there today would be impossible.  Hammerfall is not the greatest, or even historic, but they are one of today's best and most underrated bands because of the idea that you can still make good music without watering it down with growling vocals, or rap lyrics. This album is not quite a five star rating, but only because the most recent bar was set with "Chapter V," but it still has it's own great sound.  This is one of Hammerfalls heavier albums and truly a great collection of Metal songs that any fan must own.   Standout tracks: Threshold; Rebel Inside; Howlin with the 'Pack; Carved in Stone; Titan.     
 Had I the time, I'd write my own ballad here - a tragic song mourning the fact that Dover Books has apparently let the anchor of any decent Anglo-Celtic folk music collection go out of print. I take comfort in the fact that I've got mine, but those just building their libraries will have to search used bookstores and haunt the bookfinding services of the Net.  Meanwhile, one more brick is placed in the wall of time that separates us from the ancestral voices 
 Purchased as a birthday gift for my wife.  If you grew up in 80's you will have fond memories of this movie.  Not on the level of "A Christmas Story" but definitely entertaining for the whole family.  Our kids loved it. 
 If American children were required to read Robert Ingersoll, the world would be a safer place to be. His warmth and commonsense shine through everything he has ever written. His speeches are clear and insightful, and particularly relevant with much of America caught in the climate of fear stemming from the religious fervour that has engulfed them.  His writings show that a moral life has no connection with a religious belief. I confess I would give any book relating to Ingersoll's writings 5 stars as I have never found a speech of his that wasn't witty, good natured and exhibited great intelligence. His technique of always attacking the belief not the believer demonstrates his generous spirit. 
 This book is unbelievably heavy in the figurative sense.  Although the writing can be laborious, the argument put forth regarding ancient astronomical facts being tied up in "folk tales" is stunning.  Deeply researched, long, this book is definitely NOT for your ten year old 
 The 1980s were a time of unparalleled corporate greed, or so the media told us then and now. You had a bunch of workaholic young executives known as "Yuppies" pounding the pavement in New York making complete fools out of themselves. Why? Because many of these dolts were the same ijits involved in the flower power movement a few years before. You simply must hand it to the Baby Boomers--never has a generation taken so much from so many and given back so little to so few. By the time the 1980s rolled around, many of these cads turned up their sleeves and went about changing the corporate world. Thanks a lot. Largely due to the efforts of this generation, we all have to jump through a lot more hoops to get and hold a job. "Barbarians at the Gate" is a satirical look at just one aspect of the corruption the Boomers helped bring to the work world, namely the managed/leveraged buy out (...). Although several of the principals in the film look much older than the Boomers, don't be fooled. It was the total lack of morality of the post-war generation that helped fuel the greed of the 1980s.  This made for HBO film--one of the best the channel ever created by the way--stars James Garner as Nabisco/RJR chief executive officer F. Ross Johnson. This is a guy who is a born salesman, as the beginning of the film shows us when we see a youthful Johnson selling photography sessions door to door. By the time he has grown up, he's running one of the biggest corporations in America, selling cookies and smokes to people around the world. In fact, Johnson's latest brainchild is the creation of a smokeless cigarette that promises to revolutionize the industry. The possibility of huge profits from the new venture leads Johnson to make an offhand comment about buying the company so he can hold on to most of the profits. Little does he know how easy it is to accomplish this goal. His friends put him on to a fellow named Henry Kravitz (Jonathan Pryce), a corporate raider known for his skills in buying up companies and turning huge profits in the process. Johnson meets with Henry, but doesn't care for the guy that much. For one thing, Kravitz is a bit on the cold side whereas Ross is everyone's witty friend. Worse, the Nabisco executive gets the feeling that Henry won't let him run the company the way he sees fit, i.e. maintaining a huge fleet of corporate jets and posh expense accounts.  Ross Johnson decides to go ahead with his leveraged buy out without Kravitz at the helm. He contacts his old friend Jim Robinson (Jim Thompson) over at American Express, who in turn brings in hotshot financial whiz Peter Cohen (Peter Riegert) from the firm of Shearson Lehman to help finance the deal. Robinson's ingratiating wife and public relations guru Linda (Joanna Cassidy) also lends a hand. All the principals must keep quiet about what they plan to do, though, because Kravitz and other sharks on Wall Street will jump into the fray if they get a whiff of Johnson's ambitious intentions. Of course, that's exactly what happens. Kravitz does discover the plan and makes it a personal crusade to force Johnson out of the picture. Henry considers himself the "Father of the LBO," and he's not about to let a bunch of upstarts steal his limelight. He's got his own hotshots willing to work night and day in order to present a better offer for RJR/Nabisco stock to the company's board. The majority of the film deals with the minutiae of back and forth backstabbing, blatant greed, under the table dealing, and assorted other highly unethical business practices. You'll be surprised to discover how suspenseful this film makes a leveraged buy out seem.  Rarely have I seen a film that so successfully balances a message with fantastic humor, great characters, and high suspense. The message, of course, is the unbridled greed of corporate America. Repeatedly, these characters plot and plan to make a boatload of the green stuff while everyone else suffers the consequences. Layoffs don't mean a thing to these people as long as they can fill their pockets. You should despise these people, and you will at times, but most of them possess endearing traits as well. Garner's depiction of Johnson steals the show in this respect. His witticisms, outbursts, and general grouchiness are hilarious to behold, with none other than the scene where he discovers the utter failure of his smokeless cigarette serving as proof of this assertion. "I need an extra set of lungs to take a drag of this thing" is the cleanest line I can mention from the exchange. Garner's just great, and the primary reason I have watched this film at least a dozen times since it came out in the early 1990s. His overpowering presence tends to overshadow the great performances put in by Jonathan Pryce, Jim Thompson, and Jeffrey DeMunn as one of Ross's underlings at Nabisco. David Rasche does a great job in the small but very funny role of Ted Forstmann, an investment banker seeking to carve out his own niche in Ross's deal.  I don't know what the problem is over at HBO, but they consistently release their films to DVD with few to no extras. At least "Barbarians at the Gate" comes with a widescreen picture transfer, something I can't say for several other HBO releases I have rented lately. If you love James Garner, or just adore films with a high entertainment value, you must check out this obscure little gem soon. Do it for no other reason than to blow raspberries at that darned Boomer immorality!           
 I loved this book! I've always been a history nut and a cyclist, so this book was perfect. Lots of black & white photos from the old days and great stories from an insider. Makes me want to go to France to see the greatest sporting event in the world more than ever now. I just wish the book was longer, or a sequel is published soon 
 	The book Eiger Dreams is very exciting and attention grabbing.  The book is made up of articles written by Jon Krakauer that include some very interesting people and some intense first hand climbing experiences.  Many of these climbers are classic fairy tale heroes or bedtime story characters.  Krakauer captures your attention with laughable incidents or captivates you with near-death experiences.  It is a must read for anybody who is crazy about mountain climbing. 	This book does not have a plot.  It is a book designed to entertain and enrapture, which it does very well.  The clippings are not put together in any specific order it seems; they could be thrown anywhere in the book and it would be none the better or worse.  The one thing that bugged me while reading the book was the title: Eiger Dreams.  The author talks about how he tried to ascend the Eiger once, in the first chapter, and then never mentions it again.  I think that a different title that refers to the articles as a whole would be more suiting. 	The author's writing style is very good.  He explains the important details of each character or incident, and he dwells on the events that either make your skin crawl or make laugh.  The author also makes facts that would normally be boring and compares them to a different statistic or fact, which captures your attention as you learn something new.  I really think that this author has some very good ideas and shows excellent knowledge of how to write a good book. I really enjoyed reading about the climbers and mountaineers that Krakauer mentions in this book.  My favorite people were, by far, the Burgess boys.  These two classic English twins are every day heroes that children will dream of someday becoming.  Despite having a knack for trouble, these handsome, witty young men can talk their way out of any situation, unless the situation involves fists.  The Burgess boys have also pulled off some fairly amazing feats and have the respect of many authorities in the mountain climbing world.  These twins are not the only interesting characters, though.  You can read about a man who relies on shear finger and mind strength or explore any number of high-flying climbers (whether in a plane or on foot).  The people of Eiger Dreams are figures who can be looked up to and dreamed about.        As I said before, this book is a must read for any person crazy about climbing or for someone who just wants to read something new and different.  It will entertain you for the entire time you read it and something new will always be around the corner. 
 this album is fantastic. I really like this band now. The live shows have been good, and they get to stretch out a bit more in the recordings. Great production value. 
 Jerry Weissman is a blessing to the corporate world. If you read his books (this one and "In the Line of Fire") and apply his advice, there is simply no reason why you cannot become a successful presenter and public speaker. In "Presenting to Win" he is incredibly thorough in explaining, chapter by chapter, everything from putting together your story in a way that will save your public the need to think and addressing the needs they truly have (working at the strategic level), to crafting a presentation that supports you as the presenter and allows you to be the focus of the attention from your audience (at the tactical level).  This is not a book for those who want a quick fix, since it requires some "processing time" to take in all the knowledge Mr. Weissman has to share throughout its 200+ pages. But the payoff is huge for those who go through it diligently and begin to adapt their presentations with this new knowledge in mind. Definitely, the Bible on presentations: nothing less; and indeed, one of the most useful and applicable business books I have read in a while 
 Drummer Hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of Drummer Hoff, the man who "fired it off." In this story, a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon. Each man brings something different. One man brings the barrel, one man brings the carriage, and at the every end of each stanza it says "but Drummer Hoff fired it off." 	This story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story. The colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal. The story itself doesn't have any significant moral element to it...it is just a fun book. The rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous. By the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess.  Children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud. A good holiday gift. 
 Condensed Knowledge edited by Will Pearson definitely overloaded my brain.  I don't think that this is a book meant to be read over the course of just a few sittings (or in my case, one day).  There is so much info packed in here, I don't know how much I really retained, but there's superficial information about physics, biology, pop culture, music, and many other topics.  The reader learns about the main movers and shakers in each subject as well as the info you need to know to sound informed about just about anything.  I was a little disappointed in the writers' occasional liberal bent, especially about religion.  While talking about Christianity, they can be a little flippant, and the gnostic gospels are discussed as part of the Scriptures.  However, overall this is the perfect bathroom book.  When you only have a few minutes to grab something to read, pick this up and learn a little something about the world 
 There ought to be a law--anyone who plans to be a parent of a male child should be required to obtain at least one copy of this amazingly excellent book, to have at the ready at all times for this most vital part of their son's education. The book is tops. It would have made a huge positive difference in the lives of so very many guys I knew growing up. I truly envy any young man who has a parent or parents  intelligent enough to realize the immense value of this work. 
 I really loved this cd.  I am always a little afraid of buying a cd I can not hear sample music.  I have had a few that were terrible.  HOWEVER, this one was great I felt like my imagination was flying off to some place.  Some songs I wanted to get up and dance, others I wanted just to relax to.  This is by no means a roller coaster ride cd.  This does not song like Lorenna.  Not sure who thought they sounded a like 
 This book is a fantastic read for people who are just learning to cook in their adult life. Like Cook's Illustrated publications, Shirley Corriher gives you in this book a lifetime of experimentation and a depth of understanding of food chemistry. All the stuff you might have learned if you hadn't ditched Home Economics for Trig, like me.  I'm lucky to have had a Mom with a huge collection of WWI and WWII cookbooks and who was willing to let me experiment. But if you didn't have that, this book should be in your kitchen 
 This Honeywell HZ2800BW is my favorite! Easy to arrive at your comfort level, then cuts off. Heats efficiently and quietly. Heater-Fan combo. Works well in small space or as supplemental heat in large space (mine, 20x20). Small, lightweight and portable. Seems safe, good protective grill design, and a larger bottom for stability. Stays cool to the touch. For me, this Honeywell HZ2800BW comes closest to the legendary U.S.-made Vornado $100 heater, which was Rated BEST OVERALL by Good Housekeeping Oct. 2005.  (PLEASE: ALWAYS EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN USING SPACE HEATERS.) --------------------- COMPARISON OF 3 VALUE-PRICED HONEYWELL SPACE HEATERS ON AMAZON:  Honeywell HZ2800BW Turbo Heater Fan ( List $39.99) MY OVERALL FAVORITE!! I purchased this on a Friday Sale for $25 including s/h, and this has become my favorite space heater.  Heats efficiently and quietly. Stays cool to the touch. The Thermostat Dial makes it fairly easy to establish a comfort level.  Has Power On light: nice to find or not trip over in the dark! Lightweight with easy grip for carrying, and convenient cord storage.  I like the heater/fan combo.  SAFETY CLAIMS: auto off hi limit switch; motor thermal cut off fuse; back up thermal circuit breaker  Honeywell HZ-315 Quick Heat Ceramic Heater (List $29.99) HEATS QUICKLY WHEN DIALED TO "HIGH," BUT OTHERWISE SHORT, NOISY "BURSTS"!!! Best use: dial to High--constantly On--to quickly bring a room to comfort level--then unplug it?? Thermostat is basically non-functional, nearly impossible to establish comfort level--finally comes on for 5 seconds, then shuts off while air is still chilly.  Has a Power On light when plugged in.  BUT No "Off" setting, so has to be unplugged. Thermostat Dial is set right ON the ground--too low to eyeball when while dialing.  No Carry Grip, awkward to carry. SAFETY CLAIMS: Triple safety protection - 3 auto shut-off heat sensors  Honeywell HZ-2016 Heat Express Heater Fan (List $24.99) GOOD FOR THE OFFICE, BUT COOL SPOTS? This Honeywell heater/fan combo seems to leave "cool" spots, even when seated right beside it. I find myself changing the setting often. I do like IT for office use, as it is a fan/heater combo with very quiet operation. Thermostat dial is nice: 2 heat-fan speeds, a separate fan-only speed, plus an Off Setting. Very lightweight, with convenient Carry Grip and Cord Storage. SAFETY CLAIMS: Auto-off Hi-limit Switch; Back-up Thermal Circuit Breake 
 Gift for my husband.  He just loves it.  Very informative and helpful.  
 Very common sense approach to dealing with anxiety.  
 Key Words: Health, Digestion, GI, HSO, Food, Nutrition, Digestive Disorders  "Restoring Your Digestive Health - How the Guts and Glory Program Can Transform Your Life" by Jordan S.Rubin and Joseph Brasco is a good resource book for all sufferers of digestive disorders. In a very detailed and fairly simple, easy-to-understand style, the authors, a naturopathic doctor who was an ex-patient and a Board-Certified Gastroenterologist, explain the reasons for poor digestion and the resultant problems.  The book deals with a variety of GI problems such as IBS, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Dyspepsia, Candidiasis etc., and the role of intestinal flora in optimal maintenance of health. The authors offer a number of useful suggestions and very specific dietary protocols for each problem.  The experience of Jordan S. Rubin who was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease - a very serious 'incurable' disease and who tried a number of doctors and treatments adds credibility to the book. The critical role played by various foods in maintenace of intestinal flora, i.e. the various bacteria which help in optimal food digestion and absorption is brought out well. The authors explain how HSOs (Homeostatic Soil Organsims) play a major role in improving and nurturing the intestinal environment. The treatment regimen given in the book is based mostly on what worked for Rubin, modified over years by the combined wisdom of Rubin and Brasco who claim to have helped thousands of sufferers over the past few years.  The book is specifically aimed at the US and Canadian readers, but the general principles are applicable to all. Thus for understanding the types and causes of various stomach ailments, this book will be found useful for all English speaking readers. I found it very interesting and useful to understand the general principles of good GI health.  The book would have better value if suitable illustrations accompanied the detailed explanations about the role of various organs in Alimentary Canal or GI tract as it is called. The dietary program given will not be appropriate to people with different religious beliefs. Thus all non-vegetarians will not be able to accept pork or beef etc. And the program is certainly not suitable for vegetarians, though some of the insights will help lacto-vegetarians too.  The opinions expressed by the authors about the other testing and treatment options may not be acceptable to all readers, esp. those who benefited from them in earlier instances. The opinions do come across as rather subjective and self-serving at places. In my opinion, that chapter could have been written better by the authors.  The book would also have benefited from better editing and proof-reading. Chapter 10, 'Protocols' could have been shorter since mostly same matter is repeated under each condition. Alternatively, that chapter could have been bound in tear-off sheet style, so that sufferers can tear out specific sections for day-to-day reference or may be paste to their refrigerator / kitchen cabinet. Typographic errors and style errors are present, which however, do not prevent our understanding and appreciation of the subject.  These minor shortcomings not withstanding, I strongly recommend this book to those who need to better understand the Digestive Disorders in themselves or their relatives and friends etc. A good buy.    
 This book explains the ins and outs of travel by rail in Japan.  It not only manages that but provides a good source of information for seeing the important sites.  It gives the quick and easy way to get to the towns and how to get to the places you will want to see.  It may need to be fleshed out with a more comprehensive guidebook but this should be a place to start 
 The 2 live Crew decided to release "As Nasty as they wanna be" at the absolute wrong time. Congress was already making a list (Tipper Gore...ughh)of albums that they wanted to be banned, which was a total violation of 1st Ammendment rights. Needless to say, this album got released at the height of that period, and most large record retailers banned sales of the album. After lots of hearings from Musicans (even John Denver stepped in and thought is was wrong to censor music) the album was finally avaiable for sale (sticked with the infamous Parental Advisory) and I picked it up to see what all the fuss was about. Even though it might be somewhat tame by todays standards, it was dirty, yet it was good, not just because it was dirty. The 2Live Crew showed some skills, and some of the beats on this album were fantasic (had that Miami based BOOM) Time wouldnt be good to the Crew, as the the releaes got worse, and they stuck with an overuse of pornographic material that just got tired. Yet this is a really good album, which has been a bit tarnished by time, yet still another solid hip-hop effort 
 This book is a must read for the serious yoga student or teacher.  It goes into the anatomy and physiology of breathing, as well as the realm beyond.  It discusses the energy of life and the link of mind, body, and breath.  
 Randall's book is exhaustive in its coverage of Hamilton's life, development and texture.  But the result is skimpy coverage of his greatest contributions. Hamilton's finger prints are all over American political economy.   Fascinating glimces into St Croix childhood and developing anthipathy for slavery. Women's rights, too. Interesting but exhausting detal about the Revolution: walked the reader through each season from 1776 to 1781. Likely duplicating work Randall did for his Washington biography.  Cop out. Hamilton was also first secretary of the Navy; a tidbit but no meat.  
 DC comics fans who love comic art collections must have MYTHOLOGY: THE DC COMICS ART OF ALEX ROSS: it's a newly expanded paperwork edition of the original and displays all the comic book characters Ross' art brought to life over the decades, from Superman and Flash to Green Lantern. Included also is Ross' new comic book series Justice, new sketches, and an oversized coffee-table format which helps display and profile, in full color, Ross' entire line of DC Comics superheroes. An original Superman and Batman story written by graphic designer Chip Kidd, a re-telling of Robin's origin written by Paul Dini, plus new prototypes produced in the two years since the hardcover MYTHOLOGY appeared makes this paperwork a winner genre fans must own. 
 A heady treatise on altered states of being and how free will plays a role in our time space continuum.  I highly recommend this book 
 Okay, I'm not a country fan.  However, I listened to this CD, and I was stunned!  I didn't think that country music could possibly sound so wonderful and flawless.  Their taste of old-time country and danceable beats give their tracks that unique flavor.  Even if you're anti-country, I'd recommend giving "Home" a try.  You may not become a bigger country fan(genre-wise), but you won't be disappointed 
 If NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON and ALL I WANT established him as a country hit maker, Tim McGraw's 1997 album EVERYWHERE propelled him into superstar status. The album had a number of huge hit singles. The first single, "It's Your Love", a duet with wife Faith Hill, became a country smash and hit #1 for 6 weeks. An impressive feat. Even more impressive was when the second single "Just To See You Smile" also hit #1 for 6 weeks in a row. The title track was another #1 hit as well. The album also spun off the hits "Where The Green Grass Grows", "For A While" and "One Of These Days". It's no wonder that the album was successful, as there's so many great songs here. Some notable tracks that weren't singles include "I Do But I Don't", and "Ain't That The Way It Always Ends". Overall another great album from Tim McGraw 
 The clif notes are useless without reading the book.  The book is boring for the first four chapters because it spends those chapters setting the scene for the downfall.  Intellectual readers will enjoy this book if they  have patience and understand the time period in which this book was  written.  Either everyone was rich or poor.  Gatsby is a bootlegger and the  parties show the wealth.  Note: Nick gets drunk a lot as do all the  characters except for Gatsby, who is the main character supplying the  booze. Directed to other reviewers: Research the time period before making  inane comments 
 I'm a wife and mother. Our family income is below poverty level. However, after seeing this DVD, I am willing to make whatever sacrifices I have to make in order to no longer shop at Wal-Mart. I simply couldn't live with myself if I continued to shop there. Call me an extremist, and maybe I am, but I prefer to have a clear conscience rather than save a few bucks. It's just not worth it. 
 Imagine my delight as a hard-core Rendell fan when I discovered a book that I had never read!  Lonely Arthur Johnson is about to lose control of his carefully built defenses against his tendency to violence.  If the  first two pages of this book don't grab you, nothing will.  Demon in My  View is another voyage into the unexpected from the Grand Master of  psychological suspense.  It is not the very best of Rendell, but just a  notch below 
 Forget Tom Cruise and "Top Gun"! - This book gives the real inside story of what it is like to fly and fight in jet combat! It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck!  My father flew and roomed with GI Basel - and personally confirmed that this is the true story of what happened over North Vietnam 35 years ago 
 This is a wonderful presentation of the original story without the moralisms of Disney's adaptation. There is bad and good luck, cunning, bravery and dealing with tough situations without whining.  This leaves room for children to respond to the story and interpret it. My two year old grandson loved it, even if he didn't know what a churn was. The drawings are stylish. I recommend it as an addition to your basic library of classic children's tales 
 I ordered this book explicitly by ISBN to ensure the correct edition, verified the cover matched the covers on all the rest of my Aubrey/Maturin books, and waited with glee.  Amazon pulled a bait & switch on me, shipping the wrong edition (they actually did this with one additional book on my 4-book order).  The book was great though.  Highly recommended.  If you want a particular edition, though, get it somewhere else 
 Buckley's at the top of her craft as her steel-edged voice cuts to the heart of each emotional number.  The rare Broadway performer who can turn just as easily to pop material and successfully make it her own, Buckley is a dynamo in this live performance.  Her "Rose's Turn" knocks the audience for a loop.  And it's a real kick to hear all of the screaming queens in the audience go nuts for this brilliant performer 
 A haunting, futuristic novel, imagining whites fleeing from black terror in South Africa.  Explores the complex relationship between blacks and whites, masters and servants, and individuals and their environment 
 Since so many able reviewers have provided insightful and lengthy reviews of this book, I shall keep my comments short.  This book, to put it simply, should be THE starting point for any and all who question or wish to think about the doctrines of (primarily) Christianity, though the discussion of the Old Testament clearly has relevance to Judaism, too. Paine makes an assault on these religions, and utterly rejects their holy books and doctrines, because he sees them as horribly divergent from what a rational conception of God requires. Paine explicitly advocates Deism, but the arguments he makes are equally useful to atheists, agnostics, theists, and all others interested in religion.   These arguments may not be accepted as decisive by all, but they will indubitably cause any open-minded individual to seriously consider them. This is simply one of those books that anybody who seriously considers the philosophy of religion must read 
 I found this book absolute heaven. Out of all my cookbooks this one is getting tons of usage. The recipes are easy to follow and the pictures are the best. Probably the most extensive collection of chocolate recipes ever! Don't let this pass you by. Definitely worth the money 
 People are often confused about sex, not only when this novel was written, but even in this seemingly oversexed era.   DH Lawrence wrote this lyric and sensual book, where the heroine Lady Chatterley, who was well-born and well bred, happens to be married to an invalid, whose injuries were sustained in World War I. Her husband is a baronet, Sir Clifford.  The love interest in the book is Sir Clifford's gamekeeper. Connie Chatterley is not a virgin when she has this affair, but Mellors, (the gamekeeper) awakens her to life, to higher consciousness that comes with tender lovemaking.   It would be insultingly simplistic to say that Lawrence believed lovemaking is really the solution to the poison of industry, mechanization, and lack of awareness and connectedness to one's environment. Although the invalid and sexually incapable Sir Clifford is a symbol of the impotence of modern mechanization, Lawrence believed that lovemaking is only the solution when it's done right. In other words, with tenderness. The author was certainly not advocating misogyny or meaningless sex. He was saying, with sexual love where the lovers have body awareness, as opposed to cerebral awareness, which is from the mind, only part of the body.  Do we have too much sex in our age? What Lawrence would probably say, is that we have too much cerebral sex. We are not connected to our lovemaking.   This book is not pornography. Any one who believes that it is porno should read Lawrence's essay entitled "Pornography", where Lawrence ridicules pornography. Why? Because it does dirt on sex; it makes sex look dirty. In reality, pornographers hate sex; they make it look ugly and trite.   In a digital internet age, like the industrial age of the 1920s, there is no connectedness with the body and the world. Our age is filled with pornography but not filled with the kind of sex Lawrence believed in. The search continues. 
 Christian fiction at it's best.  Kingsbury delivers a great finish to the series.  Keeping God first is the theme in this dramatic finale 
 What's with all the glooming reviews?  It's a christian fiction--as pointed out by the authors on the cover themselves.  When embarking upon a book, I looked to be entertained and this book clearly does it for me as well as it should for ANY reader.  So I defend the book's purpose.  I can't put it down and I'm only half way through it--enjoying it in fact.  Choose to believe what spiritual and religious facts and truths you would like.  However, if you are inspired to search the truth, then search the inspired Word of God, The Bible; and search to understand God for yourself.  Otherwise, take the other book-bashing reviews with a grain of salt and enjoy or be moved by the experience and journey through which the book takes you.    I do recommend reading the entire series as I am doing.  The series is not a hard read and you will flow through it very quickly.  If you're looking to be entertained, this is a series for you 
 I REALLY ENJOYED THIS CD. AGAIN KINDRED KNOCKED ME OFF MY FEET. THEY HAD MY HEART FROM THE FIRST CD SURRENDER TO LOVE. THEY ARE JUST A JAZZY GROUP AND I WILL LOVE FOR THEM 2 COME AND DO A SHOW IN B-MORE CAUSE I WOULD B THERE WITH BELLS ON MY TOE 
 I bought this a few months ago and have not stopped using it since. I get up real early in the morning to go to work and I just put the coffee in the maker at night and turn it on in the morning. As long as you follow the plastic indicators on the side so you won't overflow the mug, it's great! Very easy to clean since it's plastic, keeps the coffee pretty warm. I don't drink scolding coffee and the mugs cool it off fast enough where I can start perking up a lot sooner. The only complaint I have is the tops to the mugs. They don't seem to want to stay on so you have to hold it on with your finger and your mouth so it doesn't overflow. Other than that, it's great 
 This is a fine book.  It appeals to everyone I know, from a bright young sprite to an old grump.  I especially love to read it aloud because it has great rhythm and rhyme and a refrain, that everybody likes to join in on.  I also recommend it for purchase for your own small child, grandchild, neighbor or friend, because even non-readers will pull it off the shelf over and over again.  Seuss's pictures are completely engaging.   I'll close with one piece of trivia: This was the first children's book Seuss ever wrote.  At the time, he was making his living drawing cartoons for magazines, newspapers, and advertising campaigns.  I've read his own account of how he got started on it.  He was on a cruise during a storm, listening to his ship's engines pound out a rhythm and he came up with the refrain.  Started to make notes as to just what his narrator might see, worked on the text and added drawings at home, and sent it out to editors only to have it rejected umpteen times.  Finally he just happened to bump into a editor he knew who liked it and he was off on a new career.   What a genius 
 This is a book you expected Massie to write.....since Nicholas & Alexandra was written in (I think) 1969, an update since 1991 was critical. It gives you an idea what was being discovered in DNA research and proving the bones found were who they were. Its a book a Romanov observer should have, or at least read to glean the information from. Worth it, for sure. 
 but it will rock your world when all is said and done. Somehow Pratchett keeps up the humor and intriguing plot while bringing up some questions about fundamentals like moral agency. The supporting characters flesh out a novel that is a pleasure to read. You will be pulling for Vimes as he pieces together a puzzle of a mysterious, unauthorized assassin who leaves strange footprints. You will cheer at the unexpectedly powerful ending 
 *Something* draws us to certain places and certain activities.   Inside our heads, no one really knows why.   In this book, Graham describes his compelling adventure in Southeast Asia, just weeks after completing high school, as he sought out a photo-journalism career.   At 18, he somehow needed to go to Vietnam when it was all but closed to Americans. The power of his mind got him there against all odds.   When he needs to leave Vietnam, will the power of his mind be enough to get him out of the prison he landed in for being American?  A thrilling read, with action, intrigue, drama, emotion, and insights into the power of his mind and yours....you will stay on the edge of your seat until the last page 
 At first, it seems like such a normal old school type of Sci-Fi book that there might come a time about 1/3 of the way thru, when you may be tempted to put it down because you think the style/setting/script is sort of dated.  WOW...am I glad I didn't succumb to any of that nonsense... I placed my faith in PKD, knowing full well that I would eventually be thrown for a loop.  Er...several loops.  Eventually, I got my wish.  When this one starts to build, it just takes off.  All in all, this book is so loveable because it succeeds in capturing that late 1950's - 1960's classic Sci-Fi style... but, still completely packs the reality-altering PKD whallop that we all come to expect from his works.  I'm sure that this book completely blew minds when it came out 
 This is the most wonderful Book I have ever read. I wished I could have had a book like this in my 20's . Mothers, buy this for your daughters. Nothing I have ever read has given me so much. This is Book is a treasure.      Pamela Patterson Port Arthur, Texas 
 Art restorer and occasional Israeli spy Gabriel Allon is back. He was introduced in The Kill Artist and it is one of the most interesting characters in recent literature.   The Confessor brings him back in a new; better story and we continue to discover new layers in this complex character. Also, many of the secondaries introduced in Kill Artist are back. The book can be read on it's own, but be advised that it is the middle part of a trilogy dealing with Nazis and the Holocaust. The other two books of the trilogy are "The English Assasin" and "A Death in Vienna". It is advisable; but not necessary to read them in order for better enjoyment and the sake of continuity.   If you are looking for a thriller, not too heavy in the action scenes and with a better character development and plot than the average this should be your choice. You will be back to visit with Gabriel Allon. 
 Conagher is classic western penned by the phenomenol Louis L'Amour.  It's a movie my husband and I have watched every time it came on tv. It was a must have movie to own so I was delighted to find it on Amazon. This is a movie you simply cannot forget about a hero who believes in right and has the courage to support his beliefs, despite cattle rustlers who threaten his livelihood as well as his life. Then crank up the excitement with adding a beautiful widow (Katharine Ross, Sam Elliott's real life wife)whom Conagher tries to resist, yet cannot forget and you have western romance at it's finest 
 An easy to read book with a tremendous amount of detail not only about Daniel Pratt and his business but about the town of Prattville that was named for him and the inhabitants of that town during the time period from 1835 until the 1870s.  Exhaustively researched, footnoted and indexed this book is a treasure for all who want to see a view of the South contrary to the popular agarian stereotype.  Historians as well as genealogists will find this a wonderful resource 
 After researching and reading many, many books attempting to explain the extremely complex and perplexing events surrounding the death of Marilyn, Matthew Smith's book presents a very detailed and well researched account weaving together the many threads in Marilyn's life with sobering logic. The book takes the reader on a journey through Marilyn's personal and business relationships, as well as the motives of those who sought to use her toward their own ends. It reads like a terrific mystery novel and like the pieces of a puzzle, comes to a unique and logical conclusion as to "who did it".   The only piece missing is the newest evidence, which came after the publication of this book, of the release of the secret CIA file on Marilyn Monroe. This new information through, only strengthens Mr. Smith's case that rogue agents of the CIA had a hand in her murder, as to publically embarrass the Kennedy brothers and force their resignations from public office (many other authors place the Kennedys as the main orchestrators of her death - a claim that never factually made sense). When one looks at the convergence of political struggles during the early 1960's and the many players including J. Edgar Hoover, Sam Giancana, Jimmy Hoffa, the Kennedy's, the CIA, the military industrial complex, etc., Mr Smith's logical conclusion makes the most sense.   Unfortunately, for Marilyn, she inadvertently got herself personally caught up the biggest political mess of the last 75 years and paid for it with her life. Because the perpetrators failed to nail the Kennedy's for her murder because of an amazing public relations campaign from 20th Century Fox studios buying the Kennedy's time to cover their behinds, it ultimately backfired on the Kennedy's and they all ended up dead as well. So if Marilyn had somehow lived, American history would be dramatically different.   Bravo, Mr. Smith on your crusade to get to the truth of Marilyn's murder 
 Perfect record.  3 long dance tracks and 5 short songs.  Amazing that this record went to number 19 on the Top 40 albums chart in November 1980 and remained on the chart a total of 9 weeks (considering the best selling record that year was Donna Summer's ON THE RADIO VOL I & II a great record in its own right, yet definitely a different market than the TALKING HEADS').   REMAIN IN LIGHT sold well.  Subsequent Heads albums fared even better, though similarly (per THE BILLBOARD TOP 40 ALBUMS by Joel Whitburn published 1987).  "Once In A Lifetime" was never a Top 40 hit (Whitburn's THE BILLBOARD TOP 40 HITS, also 1987) though undoubtedly an influential and well remembered video.  That song was my own, and many a listeners' entree to this record, but it quickly became my least favorite (after "The Overload").  Don't misunderstand me, though. I must point out again that this record is perfect.    Producer, the great, Brian Eno's influence is apparent, though David Byrne has a lot of rhythm and soul for a nerdy white guy...Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth, with Byrne, had by 1980 become a remarkably innovative funk band, apparently at the crest of a New Wave, issuing a record that is never overwhelmed by production.  Eno's brilliance is recognizable with how much he had learned, for one thing, that less is more, with a definitely anti-studio production where any electronics are instruments in the music and not embellishment.  The result is often seemingly motionless music, now called ambient, with dramatic and transcendent effect (perhaps most apparent on "Houses In Motion" and "Seen And Not Seen").  Those transfixing African polyrhythm you read about enthrall on foot tapper "The Great Curve," but the short song "Listening Wind" may be the most startling.  Remarkably beautiful, it is also hauntingly insightful and prophetic of today's age.    The casual listener might take this record for less than it is, but anyone with ears in tune will be mesmerized by the grooves of this classic.    
 i love this book so much. the made up words that Roald Dahl uses are just a laugh for the whole family. This was my favorite book as a child, and is still up on teh list. this book is wonderful and I highly reccomend it to anyone 
 I would put this in the top 5 Stephen King books. I loved that Flagg was in it. I read The Stand about 5 or 6 years before I read this, and it was nice to get a background on Flagg. I could not put this down. I also think this would make a great movie. 
 I bought this for my 2 dogs & it works great & cleans up easily! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it's large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home. It doesn't fit under my kitchen sink faucet. I don't have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer (wish I did))otherwise it would be a snap to fill. I have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs. The container is really heavy once it's full. My only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one (2 gallon or 1 gallon), waterer. It would be easier to handle. I also bought the 5 gallon feeder & I LOVE it! It holds a whole 5lb. bag of food which is great! So get the larger feeder & the smaller waterer. Oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it! : 
 The Short Victorious War, the third installment in David Weber's outstanding Honor Harrington series, is a very enjoyable read.  Honor is an medical leave healing from injuries suffered in The Honor of the Queen when she thwarted the assassination attempt on Grayson Protector Benjamin Mayhew.  Hostilities between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven erupt into an actual shooting war.  The PRH is a cradle-to-the-grave welfare state whose economy has gone into the toilet, as the Republic struggles to continue to support the staggering number of Dolists among its population.  The Peeps' ususal remedy for this problem is to invade planets or solar sytems that are stronger economically, but weaker militarily.  But now they are left with only weak agricultural powers to contend with, or they could go after the extremely powerful Manticorans.  Honor is eager to return to space, and gets to do so, this time in command of the HMS Nike.  Her nemesis Captain Lord Pavel Young returns as well.  The Short Victorious War is a worthwhile read, and the Honor Harrington series is becoming addictive for me, as I can't wait to read Book Four (Field of Dishonor).    
 Another great find at a place that I am starting to think is the best little bookstore around -  the Penn Station Bookstore at Newark Penn Station.  Anyhow, I was intrigued enough to buy Nathaniel Fick's book, One Bullet Away when I read the following - "I wanted to go on a great adventure, to prove myself, to serve my country.  I wanted to do something so hard that no one could ever talk s*** to me.  In Athens or Sparta, my decision would have been easy.  I felt as if I had been born too late.  There was no longer a place in the world for a young man who wanted to wear armor and slay dragons."  Like so many, I felt that urge a long time ago, but like so few, I didn't join the Marines.  Fick did, and his experiences in peace time and in wartime, are described in detail and with great eloquance.    His peace time/war time training provides wonderful insights into the world of the military in general, and the Marines in particular.  The reader is offered a glimpse of that world through Fick's eyes, and it becomes clear why the Marines consider themselves to be something like a Fraternity, rather than a social club.  You also learn early on that they trained to be an extremely efffective fighting force.  Fick worked his way through OCS, and a number of other training schools until he commanded a platoon in the 1st Recon Batallion.  His story is one of a man story converging with the events of history.  He experienced 911 on a ship, and soon found himself in Afghanistan.  Interesting that he did not experience combat there, much to his disappointment.  Returning from Afghanistan he trained, and was later assigned to lead a platoon in the 1st Recon.  It was then when he was shipped to Kuwait, and ultimately Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  His position during O-IF was as interesting as his observations of OCS considering that 1st Recon was often times a step ahead of the tip of the spear as coalition forces moved to Bagdhad.  In Iraq he saw combat, ultimately enough for him, to leave the marines.  A couple of observations -   This is as much about leadership as it is a book about someone's experiences.  Throughout, Fick's responsibility to the men around him provides wonderful real life insight into what it means to lead, and have people look to you for that leadership.  Someone mentioned this in another review, but his growth from Dartmouth grad to US Marine, through Afghanistan and Iraq is a mesmerizing and certainly telling of the complexity and humanity of someone who volunteers for the military.  A Marine Platoon is an incredible, human, and lethal fighting force.  I am glad I will never have to face one.  But also, the tact and seriousness they approach their roles is certainly worthy to behold.  They are not blind to killing, not immune from the psychological impact of warfare, and not distant from the concerns of the impact of war on civilians.  They are asked to do much, and shoulder it all.  I can understand why the military is fond of an all volunteer army.  As was the case with Fick, the people who are there, want to be there.  And as someone commented to Fick, "You can't volunteer to go to war and then bitch about getting shot at."  Finally, we often take for granted that our fighting men and women are automatons, hell bent on killing.  That is the farthest thing from the truth.  I was actually struck at how reluctant they are to fire upon anything.  Aside from an incredible fighting machine, the US Military should be known for it's restraint in combat.  For anyone looking to read about a young man's journey through the marines, and two military campaigns, this is certainly a great place to begin.  Highly readable and insightful.  Fick does a masterful job of putting the reader right next to him, whether it is working making it to the crucible, or wrestling with the weighty responsibility of making life and death decisions that impact those you are responsible for.  My hat goes off to Fick, his fellow marines, and all those serving.  
 Interested amateur here: I picked this title up because I've always enjoyed popular philology books - such as Bryson's. They left me wanting more and this book does have it.  It includes more examples from the language (Old, Middle English, Early Modern, etc.) than I remember from other popular books.  It was slower going but I loved the detail. I highly reccommend it for those who won't be discouraged after a couple hundred pages to still be in the 14-15th century. 
 Listen!  Have a few brews.  Then, listen to this albun and find yourself inmersed in the glory of elation.  Otherwise, get behind the wheel and drive the length of the album to the horizon of black hope.  You will find it rewarding.      
 Very personal writing style and detailed recommendations make this a great read and a great guide. This book covers the major sights in more detail than most compact guidebooks. The maps are easier to read than most guidebooks due to higher contrast. I loved the suggested iteneraries and "hidden" travel suggestions you may not find in other guidebooks. This is a thick book, maybe a bit bulky for travel.  I do recommend it. It has been a great guide to help me plan a trip 
 I started baking at age 3; I love to bake, and I love to experiment with ingredients.  This cookbook helped me understand the ideas my grandmothers understood without fancy tools and instructions.  This cookbook supports using the best up-to-date tools, but provides the historical and logical explanations behind what we do.  The authors discuss the importance and care of ingredients, the differences between not only flours (they are owner/employees at King Arthur) but also sugars, and other general ingredients.     I own over 50 baking books, and this is the one I use.  When I get a recipe from one of the other, older books, I look for similar recipes in this book to confirm my technique.  If you bake, you need this book!  
 Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin has been a valuable tool to me in my drama classroom. While teaching my students the proper way to apply stage makeup, I have used this book as a reference many times. Making Faces has been especially valuable when teaching my students how to use makeup for corrective purposes, and how to make them look like a celebrity. My students enjoy the pictures of the actresses made up to look like other iconic actresses. They were able to use the pictures as a guide for their own make up plots. Aucoin not only uses many colorful pictures to show the proper techniques and transformations, he also uses step-by-step instructions on how to create the look. Not only did I enjoy the pictures and instructions, but I also enjoyed reading the excerpts about his childhood and career in the makeup industry. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in makeup as an art form, theatrical makeup, and/or for someone who is interested in improving his/her appearance and technique

 This book is absolutely beautiful.  There is so much in it that we can learn, I just don't know how to put it into words.  I just barely finished it and I loved it.  Good insights into Pearl Harbor and what the Japanese citizens/immigrants went through 
 If you want a quick and easy intro to the Old Testament, do not buy this book, as it is long and detailed.  If you are a serious student of the scriptures who wants as good of an intro as possible to aid your understanding of the Old Testament, then this is the book for you.  This is one of the few academic works about which I can actually say that it made a true difference in my confidence about the truth of Christianity.  Highly recommended 
 This book is loaded from cover to cover with practical mind-training exercises - from developing the power of one's imagination, to training different senses and perfecting the ability to use them individually or in conjunction with each other; to working with the elements; transfering one's consciousness; generating and projecting energy; and much more.  By the time you're done going thoroughly through all the exercises in this book and practicing them until you master them - your ability to use the power of your mind will increase beyond your wildest dreams - and you will have many interesting experiences along the way.  
 I approach writing a review of War and Peace like I'd approach writing a review of the Bible. Everyone has heard of it, most people have some idea of what it's about, and who am I to say anything except that it's brilliant? Certainly the case could be made that War and Peace is the finest novel ever written. I won't presume even to try to make the case, but I do believe it must certainly rank among the finest. And that's in spite of Tolstoy's frequent forays into the philosophy of history when he should be telling his story. Tolstoy writes his characters beautifully. Even those with minor walk-on parts are, in very few words, fleshed out into people more life-like than you'll find starring in the works of lesser novelists. Unusually for a man, his female characters are as vibrant, complex, strong and convincing as his male characters, and they're absolutely feminine. His skill with characterization is as luminous when his characters number in the hundreds, as in War and Peace, as when he focuses on just a few, as in Anna Karenina.   My real comments are about this translation and Norton Critical Editions. Aylmer and Louise Maude had both the mastery of Russian and English and the literary taste and skill to write an extraordinary translation. They did it several decades ago, so the language had become a bit dated. Greg Gibrian revised their translation for this edition, and he brought it up to date without damaging the subtlety and grace of the Maudes' work. Even so, there are other good translations out there. I'm sold on the Norton edition because of the fine essays that are included in it. War and Peace isn't a difficult book to read or understand, but its scope is vast, its importance in Russian and world literature beyond reckoning. The neophyte to Russian literature can easily get lost in it or lose sight of its place in world literature, hence the value of the inlcuded essays. In addition, the Norton edition is printed on larger pages and a better quality paper than the other paperback editions that I own, making it somewhat easier to read. It's more expensive than most other paperback editions, but it's worth the money, and it still costs less than dinner for two at a cheap restaurant 
 I am so excited to watch this Beatles Collector's set but as of today, January 11, 2002, I have not receive my order.  Delivery estimate should be between Dec. 16-22, 2001.  I don't know what happened.  My credit card billed last month, December 2001, but not yet receive my order.  Please reply soonest.  Thank you and more power 
 We purchased these for our 7 year old daughter at Christmas. She LOVES them!!  She has had so much fun playing on them and getting lots of great exercise.  She has fallen a few times, but we stay on the grass so she hasn't been hurt.  I definitely recommend the moon shoes for hours of heart healthy fun 
 India-Arie is a very talented young black woman. If you haven't purchased this CD, please do. We have everyone of her cd's, and plan to continue purchasing anything she releases. India, keep up the good work 
 This CD, a compilation of 16 of the Indigo Girls' popular hits, is a great addition to any IG collection.  In my opinion, there isn't a bad track on the CD.  It's incredible acoustic guitar and wicked harmonies through and through 
 This book is good because the author goes into great detail and is very hard to put down.  The author has written many other good books.  Some are The Bluebird and the Sparrow and So Long a Stranger.   I recommed this book to everyone interesting in readin 
 The famous Dave of Real Wheels makes another appearance, this time as a truck diver.  This DVD is loaded with all sorts of trucks and great images of many different types.  My youngest was enthralled by the comparison of his backyard toy trucks to the real things in this entertaining video.  Great coverage of trucks towing the U.S. space shuttle, which is some very impressive footage.  Covering everything from fires trucks to garbage trucks your little ones (3-8) will not be disappointed 
 It is little wonder why the leaders at Toyota give Henry Ford the credit for leading them to the promised land of LEAN and TPS. He was way ahead of his time and in some respects his vision is still way ahead of our time. What an amazing personality, mind, and story 
 This fine film really snuck up on me emotionally, but the superb performances of Jennifer Lopez (Sharon) and Jim Caviezel (Catch) are rich, nuanced, and ultimately captivating.  ANGEL EYES works on so many levels ... suspense, action, drama, and of course, romance.  It intricately and sensitively deals with issues of life and death, loss, betrayal, and redemption.  The ending doesn't tie up everything in a neat little cliched package, either.  But aside from a wonderful script and crisp direction, the key to this film is the chemistry of Lopez and Caviezel, who can communicate so much from a look or a smile or tears.  Particularly intriguing is the character that Caviezel plays, the enigmatic Catch.  Is he dead or alive?  An angel or devil?  Is he psychotic or just deeply wounded?  Somehow, as the viewer sorts it all out, Caviezel plays Mr. Catch as a warm-yet-tragic figure who steals the viewer's hearts just as surely as he touches Lopez's Sharon.  Speaking of Lopez, this is one of her best performances; it's truly one from the heart.  She's gritty, yet vulnerable...tough, but gorgeous.  I'm not really a weepy type, but all I can say is that Sharon's amazing "tribute" to her father near the film's end had me getting embarrasingly misty-eyed. This is certainly a fantastic date movie; it really would not be appropriate for children or younger teens, however, due to some salty language, intense themes, and brief scenes of sensuality.  I am amazed that Caviezel didn't experience a superstar breakout as a leading man after this film, but it is without question a brilliant and heart-rending performance.   Comparing his work here to what he has accomplished in other films, including his landmark portrayal in THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, one sees his incredible versatility and range as an actor. ANGEL EYES is, in some ways, a collection of many small, intimate vignettes, that are woven together in a beautiful narrative tapestry.  While this film may not have burned up the box office in 2001, it's definitely a great way to spend an evening with someone you love.  
 The young son of an Albanian mother is discovered in Albania by his Scottish father, Lord Sane, who brings him back to a deteriorating manse in Scotland and schools him for a new life as his heir.  Ali, the boy, apparently tainted by the Sane family curse, soon begins his misadventures.  A painful young love, a gruesome hanging, an escape by ship in the moonlight, the discovery of a young woman masquerading as a boy, ominous sleepwalking episodes, the periodic appearance of a bear, the arrival of a ghostly double, false imprisonment--all these events figure in Ali's story, which illustrate all the complications of a Gothic romance.    Author John Crowley presents Ali's story as the missing novel written by George Gordon, Lord Byron in 1816, creating a scenario in which Byron's missing manuscript is sold to finance Byron's involvement in European movements promoting Liberty and Freedom.  Clear parallels exist between events in Ali's story and events in Byron's life, but Crowley also connects Bryon, through his manuscript, with the life of Ada Byron King, Countess of Lovelace, Byron's estranged daughter.    In a third plot line, a web site designer, Alexandra Novak, known as "Smith," is working on a site devoted to women's science history.  Georgiana, her client, purchases some  papers found in a seaman's trunk which once belonged to Ada's son Byron, who ran away to sea.  Georgiana shows Smith a single sheet of an unknown manuscript in Byron's handwriting, but there are many additional pages containing long columns of numbers, their importance unknown.  Smith's attempts to discover the secret to the numbers, written by Ada, unfold simultaneously with Ali's story.    Crowley maintains his fine sense of where and when to change the focus from Ali to Ada to Smith in order to keep the tension and interest high, creating intriguing plot lines which intersect and gradually reveal parallels in the lives of the characters.  Life, love, betrayal, alienation, separation and reconciliation are themes pervading all the subplots, and the coincidences and moments of revelation, common to all romantic novels, keep the reader intrigued.   There is no real suspense, however. Crowley begins the novel with an episode from Ali's life, making it obvious from the beginning that Byron's novel IS discovered.  The biographies of Bryon and Ada are well documented, and no suspense evolves from  new discoveries.  The episodes in Ali's life are similar to those in many other Gothic romances, not unique.  Still, I found the novel to be a delightful read--a terrific escape into romanticism, possibly the most classically romantic novel in recent years. n Mary Whipple 
 The item I received from this person came quickly and was of high quality.  I am quite pleased with this purchase.  Kudos 
 I CAN SEE WHY THIS BOOK IS SO POPULAR. "CORK" GRAHAM'S WRITING AND DESCRIPTIVE ABILITIES ARE FANTASTIC.  THIS IS A VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD BOOK!! IT REMINDS ME OF JACK LONDON'S DESCRIPTIVE WRITING STYLE 
 This book was wonderfully entertaining... erotic, dark, and slightly humorous all at once.  Susanna Moore is a fabulously talented writer and carries you through the story on the edge of your seat, hankering for the next page.  Like all great mysteries/thrillers the twist is incredible and unpredictable.  I passed this book along to several others who enjoyed it as much as I did.  A quick, fun read.  Don't miss it 
 Night Ranger is one of those good time bands that are best represented by a Greatest Hits collection. The songs here are all great with the exception (for me) the awful David Foster produced "The Secret Of My Success."   Sing Along, Now!  1. (You Can Still) Rock In America 2. Sing Me Away 3. Goodbye 4. When You Close Your Eyes 5. Sister Christian 6. Don't Tell Me You Love Me 7. Sentimental Street 8. The Secret Of My Success (UGH!) 9. Restless Kind 10. Four In The Morning 11. Eddie's Coming Out Tonight 12. Rumours In The Air  Good Stuff! It's not meant to be earth shattering or life altering. It's meant to be fun!   As a end note....Both Night Ranger's 1997 "Neverland" and 1998 "Seven" are worth a listen 
 I bought this book for my seven year old son, who is obsessed with researching this game. I couldn't drag him away from the book for days. He really enjoyed it 
 Not much to get excited about with an SD card.  Either does the job or not.  Price is such one might wonder about quality, so thought I would note:    This one was worked flawlessly in continual use (digital photo display) 
 At the time, they were revolutionary. 20+ years later everyone kinda sounds like them. But they originated the fusion, and this album is groundbreaking. Buy it. 
 I bought this for my husband (the dapper clothes horse) just because I saw it in my Gold Box.  He is a strict adherent to Flusser, so I took a risk and ordered this because it was low priced.  Turned out to be a great bargain, and a nice surprise that he enjoyed.  While he says there was no revolutionary information, it was a good read and great additional resource.  Definitely recommended 
 I read this in three sittings over 2 days and I have to say it is the best poetry I have read in a long time.  Subtle hints of Whitman and Neruda are folded into an American West verbage that sweeps you away to wherever Jim was when he wrote.  I am rereading it now and I think I may eventually test the physical longevity of this hardback 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's amazing how on the money it is for the day! Gave me many insights... In case the editor/author/publisher reads this, I would enjoy a perpetual flip calendar version of this book even more 
 Adam, I am going to call you an idiot and not even apologize. When you start writing something and try to look "very smart" you really must Know What The Hell you are writing about! That would help. You, obviously, know nothing of the subject. So everyone is wrong? All the facts, all the movies and books and stories that's been told by our ancestors?! Wake up, yes you! Reality Check, as much as you'd like it to  just "go away" it won't. It happened and Nobody is going to forget about it. I have so much I'd like to tell you, but why waste time when I can enjoy this sad and yet another wonderful book of Armenian History.. 
 I chose this book for my six- and four-year-old stepdaughters; they love fairies so I suspected it would be a hit.  What I didn't expect was that my eleven-year-old stepson was also fascinated by the book and proceeded to serve as the primary architect for the fairy houses that all three built!  I'm always happy to find something that spurs a creative family activity, so this was perfect.  My husband and I also loved the artwork.  I'm pleased to find out that this is a series, so I'll be looking for more of the titles 
 Ladies and Gentlemen let me tell you.. This album is the absolute best work from this band.. From beginning to end the lyrics are unbelievable and the closer you listen to and read the lyrics they begin to come from your own heart.. we have all been there in relationships and dating and every single song hits a key in my heart and the heart of fans everywhere.. "take a little bit of everything baby, it will be all right.. dont just settle for living the lie that i thought you might" 
 This book was by far an incredible ending to a very interesting and different Nora Roberts writing.  I was really looking forward do the big battle between good vs. evil and "Valley of Silence" did not disappoint at all. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not know what would become of Cian and Moira.  I was happy to read their love story and quite surprised at the ending.  The battle was well played out and the evil characters of Lilith, Lora, Davey and Midir were written with as much characterization as the good guys.  Glenna, Hoyt, Blair, Larken, Cian and Moira are amazing characters.  Moira started out as a somewhat meek and mild member of the circle but by story's end, she is the most self-transformed constituent of the group.  Without giving away the conclusion, all I can say is don't miss this story.  It is amazing 
 This book was absolutely fantastic for building my muscles and gaining speed.  My fencing has improved huge amounts! Thanks a lot! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
 This is the one John Grisham book I've been through more than once. That's because it is my absolute favorite! And ever since I'd read it over 3 years ago, I'd wanted a movie to come out of it, and it came close to doing it justice.   But first you take the 2 opponents who take a tobacco case to court. These are 2 hard-nosed, combatant, and they'll slice you into if you don't watch your step. They would be Wendell Rohr and then the die hard, "Watch yer back, Jack", Rankin Fitch. With Rankin, the matter is quite simple. He doesn't lose, and he'd better NEVER lose!   But then you have Nick Easter, and of course, Marlee. Man, I love Nick! And Marlee is always compelling, and always lurking behind the scenes. The funny thing about Nick is that he isn't beyond standing up to anybody. This includes the judge, and it also includes a veteran of the war who's a part of the jury. And through it all, you have a case that is worth millions. And through this case pop up all kinds of unexpected surprises.   So, surprise yourself, and see for yourself. John has always been a hit and miss author, and so he's never been my favorite author. But this, along with "The Rainmaker" happen to be up there. I personally thought this was Grisham at 110%, and it showed the whole way through. BRAVO! 
 Let's face it.  Anyone even looking at buying this movie is very likely either already a Weird Al fan, or looking for a comedy that is not quite... normal.  UHF fits both bills nicely.  Like most of Al's work, it's not a continuous rotfl fest, but it does pack some serious lol action.    But I want to address those who already own an older copy of this movie.  Why buy this DVD version if you've already got the VHS, or Laser Disc (yeah, I'm a LD loser)?  The extra features.  I've seen this movie many times, but listening to Al (and his guests') commentary made it a new experience again.  He either has a remarkable memory or is incredibly anal about keeping track of information, because he knows the story behind every actor, prop and set in the movie.  Mostly funny, but there are also a few touching moments.  I particularly enjoyed his out-takes.  Unlike most DVD deleted footage, he partially narrates his, explaining why scenes got cut, and sometimes fast-forwarding through bits that are too slow.  And the price makes it worth having a copy that's easier to handle than a Laser Disc, or a VHS tape, for that matter.  I'm not a big Easter Egg hunter, so I only tracked down a couple.  Cute stuff, but nothing to write home about.  Al, if you're reading this: Don't you think it's time to make another movie?  I promise I'll go see it, and even make my wife go along 
 My son was only a month when I started showing him this book.  Every page has the color written and pictures that are the same color. (example: GREEN: leaf, pear, frog, etc.) This is his absolute favorite and he never seems to get tired of it. I recommend this as a MUST HAVE for any parent. If you like this book then you should check out Happy Baby 123 
 Drawing is the basis of making good art and perspective is the basis of good drawing.  Phil Metzger presents the means for making perspectively correct drawings.  Yes, it's without "pain" because the mathematics of perspective is not presented; but, to get it right the "pain" is in the practice.  Where it should be 
 In a world of televangelists and door to door bible beaters, many people are discouraged and even turned off by the thought of evangelism. Even as so many have a desire and a need for basic Bible teaching, we are often too shy to even begin discussing the roadmap of Christianity, the Holy Bible. After all, religion is one of two subjects we are told to never discuss in polite conversation. It's into this environment that just the right guidebook comes along to truly fill a need, How to Be a Christian Without Being Annoying, by Bette Dowdell.  In an easy-to-read devotional format, Dowdell uses biblical references to start a discussion that leads to an understanding of what each excerpt means. Each segment begins with a Bible verse, with a concise definition of words and phrases as well as pronunciation of some of the more challenging words. Dowdell quotes from several Bible versions, both old and new, allowing readers to experience different translations to identify which is best suited to them.  On the second page of each segment, Dowdell includes a short discussion of what the verse is saying, and how it is pertinent to us today. Much more than a simple explanation, these devotionals are an affirmation of biblical truths through the use of modern language, stories and parables. Her words are a perfect jumping off point for new believers and a wonderful introduction to the Bible for doubters, agnostics and non-believers. Dowdell uses her humor, wit and understanding of people to complete the connection between the Old Testament, New Testament and Today.  This book is ideal for group study, a daily devotional, an individual study or a bedside reader. Dowdell proves to have a deep understanding of the Bible, and speaks in a voice that clearly communicates to the reader. How to Be a Christian Without Being Annoying is a must have for both men and women in any stage of life.  
 I love this smaller crockpot for dips of any kind. My family has food at every get together and having this 2 1/2 quart crockpot is perfect. It makes cleaning up easier too 
 I agree with many reviewers about the spotty quality of a lot of material.  Neophytes would do better to get the stuff he released in his lifetime, plus First Rays of New Rising Sun.  My main reason for buying this was to get some of the tracks previously available on Rainbow Bridge and War Heroes, particularly Tax Free and Pali Gap.  Those two tracks, along with the title track, "South Saturn Delta", give a slight hint at what Jimi might have done next, had he lived.  For 1971 Jimi was scheduled to record with Gil Evans and with Rahsaan Roland Kirk.  What would those sessions have sounded like????  He also allegedly did some jam sessions with Miles and with Sam Rivers.  I'm convinced that Jimi had not reached his creative peak when he died so prematurely.  Sadly we'll never know, but this collection does give you a slight glimpse, and for that it's valuable 
 An optimistic, well documented condensed history of petroleum "the current undisputed king of energy," and its "invisible but firm grip on billions of lives." A quick and well organized read. Highly informative 
 Michael Solomon's Conquering Consumerspace is a tremendous resource for an entrepreneurial, marketing novice like me. It conveys everything I need to know about branding and navigating the waters in today's competitive marketplace. The insights and practical ideas provided will prove invaluable for my company's success 
 This is a wonderful guide for parents and educators who are searching for techniques to help children avoid the pitfalls of "following the crowd." The author provides many practical strategies and "real life" examples of how to interact with children to prevent inadvertent development of an external locus of control. The suggestions are powerful and helpful to all adults who want to help children become independent thinkers in a world filled with challenges. Following the author's advice will enhance student development and improve parenting skills simultaneously 
 Having in interest in both international relations and economics I could not have asked for a better book to read. "The Lexus and the Olive Tree" provides a very it's readers with a different view of the world as we know it.  Despite having written this book in the late 1990's, Friedman was correct in his analysis of the future of globalization. In his updated edition that was released in May 2000, I believe, he wrote that the super empowered individual would be one of the greatest threats to America and what happened practically a year later? September 11th  He also advocated that business men should start caring more about the environment as to maintain a balance between corporations and environmentalist and guess what? Business Week's August 2006 noted a drastic increasing trend in which companies fund environmental projects and become more aware of the natural world.   Even in the year 2006 this book is rich in informing it's readers on the subject of globalization. Not to mention this book, although long, is a very easy and interesting read. For example, Friedman uses the NBA as a microcosm for the world with Michael Jordan symbolizing America. What can be a better way for a young adult like me to understand globalization?   This book is truly remarkable and I recommend it to anybody who has an interest in business, technology, environment or politics/social science. 
 I've already purchased several copies of this beautiful book, both as a souvenir of my favorite city, San Francisco, and as a a perfect symbol of what I stand for: greater respect for, and more humane treatment of, animals. The city's diversity is reflected both in the types of people highlighted in the book and the surprisingly varied species of animals they love and care for. The idea of having the people write letters on behalf of their pets was truly inspired and gets to the heart of the human-animal relationship: a state of unconditional love. Buy it today 
 I bought a stainless 3qt Emeril pot on a whim to start making chocolate desserts. Thus far in life I have "cooked" in pots that were from the cheapy aisle at Ikea or a thrift store. My interest was strictly mac and cheese and maybe some boiled potatoes. My wife was speechless when I grabbed this pot during a visit to a home store and announced my plan to make some truffles. I had secretly read one of her Martha Stewart magazines and saw a recipe that used chocolate, butter and cream, which was one ingredient (bacon) shy of perfection.  Though the "Emeril" badge on the pot is a huge turn-off, the pot feels hefty and serious.  My wife has some Calphalon non stick pans that I am not allowed to touch, but when I sneak some grilled cheese in there I get a similar sense of quality. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I decided to read the instructions.  Hey, guess what? You are supposed to clean the pot after use and hand dry it to avoid ruining the finish. Huh! And... you aren't supposed to heat the pot to the melting point of aluminum (1220.58°F for the curious). Who would have guessed? So, this pot represents a step into a "real" kitchen for me.  How does it work? Really well as far as I can tell.  I made chocolate truffles over a three day marathon. Nothing got stuck or burned into the pot, and I gained 2 pounds in the process.    I notice my wife staring at me as I gently hand rub my pot to its factory shine after a grueling potato boiling session. Perhaps she is jealous of my newfound joy of cooking.  All it took was a little investment in a decent (ok, shiny) pot to get me notice this big room in our apartment that food comes out of. BAM! 
 This is such a great movie if you are a RED SOX fan, let alone a baseball fan.  You get to see great shots of Fenway park.  I would recommend this version of the movie because there are great deleted scenes that feature some of the RED SOX players, etc.  I recommend it 
 "The Corrections" is one of the most unique books I have read in a while. It tells the story of a family - two elderly parents and their three adult children - trying to reunite at Christmas. The book is split up into sections, with each section focusing on one of the family members, but it is not a straightforward read. Author Jonathan Franzen explores the backstories of each character, taking the reader all over the country. I read the book over the course of about 3 weeks, and although it sometimes took me a minute to remind myself where I was when I picked it up, I didn't find it hard to follow. The book is very well-written. There were a few sections that seemed pointless to me, and occasionally I felt too much time was spent on a certain topic, but for the most part, I really enjoyed this novel. It was funny but also very sad. The book deals with issues of parental illness, depression, and abuse, and the reader can identify at some point with nearly all of the characters. Overall, I would definitely recommend "The Corrections" to someone looking for an unusual and entertaining book 
  I Think the 5,000 year old Mummy is very good discovery. I never knew that there could be a Mummy in the alps or any other extremely cold moutain area. (I was just plain dumb about that). I Think that this book about the Ice Mummy is very good to learn about. (Besides King Tutankahamun). The Mummy, i realized can be almost anywhere, but not the USA. You can learn from this discovery, many of you. 
 My son got this book for his 2nd birthday and he really likes it.  When I read it I really ham it up and he laughs out loud every time.  It's very cute and a pretty quick read (for those with shorter attention spans).  I would definitely recommend this book 
 They arrived on time and unbroken - expertly shipped. All of the elegance, functionality and quality of Riedel and almost 1/2 the price. You can't beat that. If you already enjoy drinking wine from your wedding gift set, you may find drinking from these even more enjoyable as they do enhance the bouquet and the taste of the wine (I've used them for Bordeaux, Rioja, Chateauneuf du Pape, etc. as well as Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.) All of our more expensive, more fragile Riedels are long gone to the great broken glass box in the sky. Enough of that - buy these glasses and use the money left over for that bottle of wine you thought was out of reach...and you'll have the glass to enjoy it 
 Al Green has a "one of a kind" voice. HIs music is unforgetabble!! Another Great Addition to my 60's & 70's Collection of GREAT MUSIC!! You won't be dissappointed in this CD - It's A-1!! 
 `So Many Ways' marks an outstanding debut for this young and talented artist from the United Kingdom.  Since 1996 the U.K. has been aware of his ability as a keyboardist and producer, now its time for the rest of the Jazz world to hear him. At the turn of the century Oli Silk joined bassist Danny Sugar to form the fusion duo `Sugar & Silk' releasing two albums (`Fact of Friction?' in 2000 and `Duality' in 2002) now on his own, `So Many Ways' released on Trippin `N' Rhythm records embarks a new international beginning for Oli. This project from start to finish proves to be `smooth as silk' full of soulful rhythms, funky grooves and silky smooth jazz flavors. The smooth jazz hit `Easy Does It' exemplifies how smooth Oli can get. In `So Many Ways' the man lives up to his name!  Watch out for Oli Silk as his outstanding debut, implies that he may be the next in line of great smooth jazz keyboardists! ~the JazzeOne 
 Poor old Rumpole.  It is madness as usual (imagine a lawyer not out to empty your pockets like a "cut purse!).  A fun read as usual even if "She Who Must Be Obeyed" doesn't get it.  You may not agree with some of the liberality, but it is still fun 
 I gained invaluable insights about writing, publishing, promoting and selling my own book after reading and studying, 'The Complete Guide to Self-Publishing.'  The varying applications have aided me in my growth as both a writer and person.  As preference, I write topical commentaries centering on community building initiatives.  The lesson most revealing in my behalf, is, writing desirable material with consideration of one's audience.  Considerably, my audience has grown substantially in light of this objective approach.  Honorably, I received a letter of warm support in respect of my essays from a former Rhodes Scholar.  Thank you Tom and Marilyn Ross. 
 When Get Born was released I wasn't impressed at all, it was poppy bubblegum that hardly ment anything but now they have realized that MTV doesn't make you popular your music does and know they have more room to grow and become bigger than ever.  And maybe MTV can get their head unstuck from the bubblegum and try some real music.  Stand Out Tracks:  Hey Kids  Come On Come On  Stand Up  Rip It up  Put Your Money Were Your Mouth Is  
 This book is revisionisim at its best.  Dr. Litwack articulates the experience of blacks in the South with such depth that it becomes an inegral part of American History. A person seeking a challenge of old ideas  must read this book 
 I got the camera about  a week ago and highly recommend it. If you buy this camera, I recommend getting an H type card which is much faster than the M type for taking pictures. Some movie functions do not work to full capability with the M type but do with the faster H type. I also recommend getting NIMH 2700 mah batteries and charger. Their higher capacity is worth the money  and will save over the long run.   As far as the camera goes, I wish the camera was higher than 7.1 mp, but compared to my old 3.3 mp camera, the pictures are so much clearer and finer. The camera has many functions build in, and you will need to read the manual to get full use of the camera. Out of the box AUTO mode works well, but after reading the manual, I think most higher end users will want to set their own modes.   Some nice included functions are the manual ability, the ability to choose among 15 different shooting types (such as through a window), and the ability to store raw images among others. Storing raw images is slow due to the large file size and can take several seconds on an M type card.  Movie mode is able to take 30 fps at 640X480, but 15 fps is still good  quality. With the M type card you can only take 15 seconds of movies at full mode, but H type you can fill your memory card. The default setting for movies is without sound so you will need to turn this on. However, with sound turned on, I was not able to zoom, even with the H card.  Image Stablization was nicely setup and can be set with just the push of a button rather than going through the Menu. Also, the eyepiece viewfinder is setup so that if the display on the back is on, the viewfinder is off and vice-versa. In fact when you use the eyepiece viewfinder, the picture that is normally displayed on the back is now in the eyepiece. I suppose this is good for taking pictures when it is too bright to see the back screen.  Finally, I like to take weather  shots and this camera includes a time lapse mode, which I can put together with my old software (not Olympus) into a movie.   [...]  
 This book was very well written and has a deep plot. The themes in this book are not clear but there are themes. On theme is you should never give up. This is showed by Axel's uncle, he keeps going on without caring about the dangers that lay ahead. He also can persuade them by his voice that is all knowing leads Axel to believe that he should keep going on. This act of bravery helps them through their toughest challenges.    This book is somewhat believable because they describe the scenery so well that it seems real not just in a book. But the book seems unreal because we all know what happens in real life so this book breaks the natural laws of the earth. Though the book seems that you could do what axel and his uncle did you can't. This is a great book and is a fun adventurous book to read. 
 Arthur Enders probably wishes he was writing music for a genre with more devoted followers. Unfortunately, his claim to fame is as the head of mainstream emo band The Early November, the archetypical embodiment of a genre that for me is saturated with some of the more gut wrenching of high school attitudes. Emo's success, especially in the last few years, has been due mostly to its appeal to the layperson; although not exclusively appearing in the seven-CD collections of ninth grade girls, it certainly is getting close. The accessibility is nothing to hold against the genre, unless you're an intolerant bigheaded snob, the ranks of which I am obviously quickly approaching. Emo is rarely something to obsess over (though there are those who are surprisingly devoted to it) and therefore this obscure solo project will remain virtually as underground as can be.  The album initially caught my interest when I heard the "Kashmir"-esque epic "Whispering Actually", with its throbbing synthesized strings creating an ominous mood I rarely heard in emo. It's not quite the towering masterpiece it masquerades as, but it is the most exciting work by an emo musician that I have ever heard. This is because it stands tall and seems to valiantly abandon the melodramatized mundane for the straightforward myth, also much like Led Zeppelin. I couldn't expect the whole album to be like this - it would be positively confusing if it were - but I also had faith that Ace's cool ideas would, even if less frequently displayed, be up to par. Instead he thought he could riddle the album with aspects of the great concept albums, which wear so thin they are usually transparent. But how can I pretend not to appreciate the effort? I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business is above-average emo in a totally different way than Brand New's Deja Entendu (which I believe is still the genre-topper); Deja was comfortable being emo and did all that could be done with the genre on one album, while I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business is a collection of restless and sloppy stabs at the walls of the style.  Perhaps I should step out of the realm of generalization to illustrate what I actually mean. Recordings of what sound like radio clips and television shows are literally ubiquitous; virtually every song uses it at the beginning and end, perhaps to give the impression of one long studio session with a TV left on in the back the whole time. I can only feel the intended effect of this technique when I listen to Pink Floyd, the original employers. Enders' reverence is in the right place, but as insensitive as it sounds, the technique bored me on this album.  Another vibe I get from this album is that of a very long wind-down. Since "Whispering Actually" is the conceptual peak of the album, the sappiness of tracks 3 onward suggests the album will close soon. There's an interesting reason for this. The great album writers of the past several decades have always recognized a curve of energy and creativity that rises and falls during the course of the album, and have arranged accordingly. (I can just see the iPod puppets reading this with slacked jaws). I guarantee that Beatles enthusiasts wouldn't have loved "A Day in the Life" quite so much if it hadn't been the concluder for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Many otherwise consistent artists have used the concluding track to be their most honest, profound, lo fi, lethargic, or "emo". It's too bad that the commercialism of the genre has cheapened the effect of real heartfelt honesty, but there you have it. I'm a child of cynicism. I rolled my eyes before I could help myself when Track 7 came on with "It gives me/hope for the best in everyone/ in understanding what we've done..." I could have forgiven the cheese if it was the last track, but it's not even halfway through the album. Even if the attention curve was well constructed, the album would drag at an overlong 15 tracks and 50-odd minutes.  There are many things that can be relied on that will comfort some and exhaust others. The acoustic guitar is everywhere, which at least lends the music more sophistication than simple power-chord progressions, though since I find this music best when energetic or epic, the steady plucking at the beginning of so many songs eventually felt like a telltale omen that I wouldn't be too impressed. Ace's voice is another universal constant, and that's not a good thing. At its worst it feels like the musical equivalent of spreading cream cheese on bacon - that is, it's so emotional that even if you could enjoy some aspects there is so little subtlety that it's just overwhelming. At its best, it's deliberately cracked but able to carry a tune, like most indie singers.  If there's one great thing about this album, it is that the ear-catching and mind-catching techniques are often hand in hand. Enders makes sure that at least one part (chorus, verse, harmony) in each song has these characteristics of simple originality and catchiness. For example? "The Best Happiness Money Can Buy" is a campfire singalong with a good rhythm and a smattering of vocal layers featuring several Aces singing somewhat casually. Don't take this as the insult it could be designed for, but the track is good because it's so short. There's little room for much more than a catchy chorus. So no, I'm not suggesting Ace couldn't write a perfect song, with ideally balanced parts, he just couldn't write fifteen of them. He had a pretty good idea what he wanted with this album, and that certainly wasn't for it to have "filler" and a few hits. So he distributes his songwriting talent, and anyone with the drive to buy the Early November lead man's solo album will certainly have the attention span to appreciate it for what it is - a consistent effort and vision with inconsistent compatibility.   B- 
 I loved this book, because it shows the begining of his homosexuality and how it all started. Never did I read a book like that a day in my life and still have'nt I read a book even close to its caliber.That's why his worked is constantly talked about and now one hasn't even come close to his level of writing.The symbolism of the title is very creative and cleve 
 I thought this man was SO funny, defently worth the money to get him.  Just beware, people will think your crazy if you laugh alone 
 Another hilarious cube vision movie.  Mike Epps is one of the funniest guys on the planet and Cube's serious personna make for a classic goofy guy/straight guy combination.  Get some popcorn,  take a few deep breaths,  cause you will laugh.  Its a gas!! 
 It is clear after using this cookbook that the author is not only an accomplished chef and dedicated vegetarian, but also that he spent time living in Italy (Florence), thoroughly understands the mixture of flavorings in Italian cooking and the importance of fresh ingredients AND is a busy family man who doesn't have hours every night to spend in the kitchen!  Whether you are a vegetarian (as I am) or a meat-eater who loves Italian food, this is a must have for your cookbook library.  The recipes in this book are incredible and numerous - there are sections for all kinds of Italian specialties, including pizza, risottos, pasta, salads, antipasto, frittatas, legumes, panini, dolci (desserts), vegetable sides and main dishes, etc., etc.  For the most part, the recipes are simple to make and not too time consuming and use easily available, fresh and healthy ingredients.  Included in the Introduction to the book are suggested menus for varying occasions and seasons.  All-in-all one of my favorite cookbooks in my large collection, and one I go to time and time again for delicious, healthful, Italian meals 
 I read this book at the beginning of 2005 and have become increasingly impressed with its message over time. Basically, it makes no bones about setting out a way to view the world through a cyclical prism, highlighting the importance of "having a way to view the world" when unexpected things happen. Well if, before I read this book and learned to watch the WLI & FIG, you told me that Fed rate hikes and oil price spikes would not slow the economy I'd have said you were crazy. Now I know that there are certain times in an economic cycle when this can actually happen. More recently the hype around the Katrina and the economy debate is mind numbing, unless you have a solid framework, like that offered by this book 
 Man, this was almost like watching the Jackson 5 reunion. It wasn't that crazy, but it was pandemonia when Commissioned walked on stage. I've had the DVD since the day it came out and I've watched it everyday. The only thing that bothered me is that the DVD didn't have any special features like pre and post-concert interviews or any behind the scenes looks. But, all in all this is a tremendous experience. I saw them in Charlotte and it was the best concert I've ever attended. These guys are great and their chemistry is great onstage. Marvin and Marcus cutup on stage. The two drummers are awesome. The brass section is fun to watch. You can't see their antics on CD. On "Ordinary Just Won't Do" you get to see the emotions behind the singing. This was just fun to watch. Of course, with DVD you can just fast forward to your favorite song. This is a must have for any old or new Commissioned fans. It was like watching Earth, Wind, and Fire 
 i like clinique a lot i needed powder so i got it, in beige..i also like the double pressed powder for even more coverage..fast shippin 
 Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice 
 I got bored with books on philosphy and eastern mysticism a few years ago because of the sorry collection usually carried by bookstores. I ordered this one, along with "I Am That" by some Indian chain smoker with an unusually long name, from Amazon and these two books make a great combo.  If you have an interest in philosophy, Buddhism, Advaita, or just someone on a spiritual search of any kind - this book is a must have. I would consider "Look for Yourself" to be in the same vain as Alan Watt's "The Taboo of Knowing Who You Are" & "The Wisdom of Insecurity". It's every bit as intelligent as Watt's writing but more accessable for the the western mind to comprehend. "Look for Yourself" offers clear explainations on exactly HOW you have become disconnected from yourself and also gives you practical advice on returning to the true nature of who you really are that has always been right in front of you.  Someone not familiar with eastern thought might find this book a bit confusing at first. But this book is a great companion for those who already have an understanding of concepts like "emptiness" and "no-mind". It's a shame this book only has five reviews and is so hard to find. It's much better than most of the popular spiritual literature you'll find at your local Barnes & Noble.  This one's a dandy and get's my highest recommendation. 
 This book is far better than an average review of 2 stars!  I thought it was a very elegant book, with a cast of characters that bring Paraguay alive.  It is short, so it moves quickly.  And it really runs the gamut with the plot.  There is romance, war, death, betrayal, birth, Europe, Latin America.  Moreover, I learned something about Paraguayan history, I had no idea it was this shocking.      I would warn readers that though the back of the book says it's in the vein of Vargas Llosa and Garcia Marquez, I don't think that's an accurate comparison...simply because it takes place in Latin American doesn't mean it's in the vein of Latin American authors.  
 At first they were skiddish when I turned on the brush.  NOW, they push each other out of the way to get groomed with this brush, actually lifting up their legs to ensure they get belly rubs. I brought one for myself as it does a great job if you can't shampoo your hair. ***** 5 stars 
 I have no clue how I found out about this book but am very glad I did since it has become one of my favorites.  At 110 pages, it is a very fast read.   This is not a story with a plot. It is not about a woman, unfortunate or otherwise, as the title might lead you to believe. It is very non-linear like the natural ebb and flow of a 5 hour conversation you might have at stupid o'clock in the morning when you interrupt your own thoughts with tangents. It is random but not disjointed. He writes about things others might not find worth mentioning but does so in such detail that it becomes interesting and even injects a bit of humor in the process.   Although billed as fiction, it is apparent that his journaled words are truly an autobiographical slice. 
 I think System Modeling should ship this book with their software (I don't know, just use Arena in school and never bought it yet). This book is self-explaination.  Tutorial is great.  Easy to walk-through or jump to  each chapter if you want to. If you are "or" will be using Arena,  get this book.  You won't regret it.  Don't forget to check another book of  Kelton.  That book will take you to more detail of what simulation is 
 Fantastic; a book I would recommend to just about anyone.  To address some of the critics mentioned in the other reviews: RE: "Dewey Dogma" (1) There is absolutely no pretense of an application of the scientific method, hence there can be no mis-application; (2) This book strikes me personally as one of the least dogmatic things I've ever read in my life.  The ideas are fresh, original, and beautiful crafted and ordered; (3) "Education is Socialization" - an equation of broadly construed "-tions" that results in a statement that one can neither agree nor disagree with.  	I could be wrong, but nowhere did I read these ideas as explicit recommendations to be implemented, rather I read this book as a general exploration of educational aims and processes.  Dewey (justifiably in my opinion) explores closely connected concepts which I imagine are left out of other educational texts, which is why some with pre-professional backgrounds in education count the length and depth of this book as a negative.  	His writing, in my opinion, is clear and concise (at least in comparison with other great philosophers) - writing that I would personally aspire to.  His ideas, and I can't say this enough, are some of the most original I've come across.  We didn't really cover the pragmatists in any of my philosophy classes.  Reading this makes me wish we had. 
 Yeah I was like 5 maybe 7 I don't remember and don't wanna' do the math-but this movie stands out.  So 80's and a lot of faces that were young back then and not so young right now.  The colors of the outfits and funny sometimes sexual overtones keeps the adults laughing (or rolling their eyes) and is totally okay for a kid to watch because you just won't get it if you're that young.    Time travel, love, fighting, and just plain silly scenes keep this a perfectly 80's stereotype that Mystery Science Theater 3000 could have worked on.  However it stands fine on it's own.  80's fans have to know/own this one 
 In 1996, New York University physicist Alan Sokal wrote a paper, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity", discussing how theories of quantum gravity prove that physical 'reality' is merely a social construction and exploring the resulting progressive political implications and the need for a new "liberatory postmodern science" and mathematics.  On the day it was published by the journal Social Text, Sokal revealed that it was nonsense: nothing more than "a melange of truths, half-truths, quarter-truths, falsehoods, non sequiturs, and syntactically correct sentences that have no meaning whatsoever", along with a large number of (regrettably accurate) fawning quotations of the editors of Social Text and other postmodern luminaries (268-269).  How shocking.  "Fashionable Nonsense", coauthored by Sokal and Belgian physicist Jean Bricmont (originally published in French as "Impostures Intellectuelles" in 1997) is another product of the same research that prompted Sokal to perpetrate his hoax.  Troubled in the mid-90s by reports of 'postmodern' intellectuals abusing scientific concepts in their work, Sokal did some research and found plenty of examples.  A few were incorporated into his hoax, but there was not room for many of them there.  To complement "Transgressing the Boundaries", Sokal and Bricmont compiled many of the most flagrant cases of scientific abuse into this volume, accompanied by clear explanations of what is wrong with the examples considered and how they are abusive.  The postmodern luminaries Sokal and Bricmont consider are Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari and Paul Virilio.  All are represented through lengthy extracts from their offending works.  Many reviewers of this volume have claimed to find the nonsense spouted by these individuals inadvertently hilarious.  I personally found it more depressing (and often painful) to read their twisted prose with at least a partially open mind.  I couldn't bring myself to enjoy the book, though I recognize the service it does in battling obscurantism and abuse of scientific terminology.  In addition there are three 'intermezzos': one on epistemic relativism in the philosophy of science that didn't overly impress me, as well as two more entertaining chapters on abuse and confusion related to chaos theory and Godel's theorem.  Finally, "Fashionable Nonsense" includes Sokal's "Transgressing the Boundaries" and some related material in appendices.  As a second edition, Sokal and Bricmont have a valuable opportunity to clear up ambiguities and misunderstandings as well as address criticism of the original French "Impostures Intellectuelles".  For instance, they are able to emphasize (repeatedly) that their purpose isn't to challenge postmodern philosophy as such, only "to denounce intellectual posturing and dishonesty" (16) as related to scientific concepts.  In addition, they note that 'postmodernism' is not a strictly accurate term and is used in part "for convenience" (14) and refute accusations of being right-wing reactionary American intellectual imperialists (Sokal's leftist credentials include a pilgrimage to Nicaragua in the '80s to teach mathematics under the Sandinistas).  While the mid-90s furor over the 'science wars' seems to have died down, "Fashionable Nonsense" still performs a valuable service in exposing and debunking abuse of science, expanding the critique introduced by Sokal's hoax.  Though I didn't find the book enjoyable reading, it effectively delivers an important message and constructive critique 
 I too was a little apprehensive about the title, but I bought about four books at the same time.  Many of the real-estate books are get-rich-quick-squeme-type.  This is a VERY practical guide on what to look for, how to appraise, how to rent, etc.  I very highly recommend it.  I call it the BIBLE of real estate investing.  5 stars 
 I'm not a baseball fan.  Hockey is the game of my heart.  Baseball?  No way.  But, I loved this book.  The only other baseball book that I've ever read that comes close to this high-water mark is Ball Four by Jim Bouton.  Funny and interesting in its own right.  A real joy to read.    Great characters and insight to management.  A wonderful story about tearing down a culture from the inside.  And who can argue with the Oakland A's success?  Here it is September 2006 and they're once again leading their division, 5 games up on the Angels ... and this is the inside track on how they've done it with one of the worst payrolls in baseball.      
 A pleasant surprise.  Given the variety of songs  and stunning vocals on his last Album, Don't Give Up on Me, I wasn't sure what the King would do as a follow up.  But after listening to the new album twice I can testify that he hits the mark quite often here.  His anguished wail on "It makes no difference" and his soulful pleas on Fading Footsteps prove once again that this guy sings from the heart and soul.  And if you have any doubts about his place in music history, just listen to him tear up the Hank Williams tune "Wealth won't save your soul".  Don't let this one pass you by 
 Excellent help in planning trip to the south west USA. We intend to take a two week auto trip in the area and it has some great ideas for the visit 
 A young, wild, mischievous girl, Lyra, finds herself caught in the power-play between her scientist father the Lord Asriel and her chillingly powerful and elegant mother Mrs. Coulter. While her mother and father seem to like Lyra, it seems only because she was a product of their passion. Asriel and Coulter are both vying for the power of a bridge into another world through the Northern Lights, using children as a source for this power. Lyra is a powerful, clever, and strong-willed child who fights her way towards her destiny. Her character is quite unique for children's literature, as she's a bit of strong willed brat. This, though, is deeply refreshing. The book is quite clever and imaginative, particularly the bond between the humans and their daemons (animal spirit guides), as well as the characters of the militaristic polar bears. Children are not cute little idealized creatures, but pitiful weakling innocents at the mercy of cruel, horrible, adults. Pullman captures the adventure and terror of childhood, as well as its power and strength. And it appeals to anyone who has been a child. A clever, beautifully well-written book that is thoroughly imaginative and mysterious. Grade: B 
 This book is a treasure.  I read it once in a trance, and I am on a second reading, which I feel sure will birth a third and more readings, hopefully until I read it and wake up!  under the shelter of Sher's words, my current Bodhi tree.  This book is so achingly beautiful that is almost isn't there; I have to reassure myself that I own it (Does anyone ever truly own beauty?).  The sharp read-aloud-able passages  are anything you want them to be--- poetry, aesthetic theory, a guide to writing and life---  and everything you want them to be.  This isn't a book for those who like clear guidelines, and yet the book is full of clear guidlines.  It's pretty deep.  I recommend it highly for serious (happy) artists and human beings.    
 My daughter and I are enjoying singing to the songs on the CD; it is very nice to have the lyrics appear on our cheap-o karaoke machine.  BUT, one bummer is that the singers on the non-karaoke versions are NOT the original singers and this was not advertised on the website.  We were expecting that the songs would be indeed sung by the singers that popularized the songs.  This was misleading 
 Simply put Social Intelligence is the recognition of one's own ignorance and faithful dedication to one's principles. Every day and specilally during our Meirc Training programs in dubai I meet professionals with very high IQ and very low social IQ. Social Intelligence shows why it's important to have both. It's filled with wonderful examples that show what social intelligence is and how to develop it. This book is recommended reading for any leader and any coach and will be my recommended reading for all trainees in particular the intelligent people attending NLP training 
 I have read thousands of books on a variety of topics and scores of books concerning UFOs/Flying Saucers/Aliens. This book rates in my top ten for this genre. Jim Marrs did a great job. He provides thorough research references/footnotes etc. so you can pursue the interesting topics that he uncovers in more depth. Anyone interested in alien intelligence on this planet should read this book. As a result of this pleasant reading experience, I have purchased his other books and am looking forward to examining what they contain. 
 This MP3 is an outstanding and unique player.  At work, I drive and walk around outside and I need to be aware of my surroudings, so no earbuds.  The built in speakers are what sold me and they sound great, considering that each of the two speakers are about the size of a dime.  Even with the speaker out, it easily goes in and stays in my pocket.  The play modes live up to their descriptions. I use Bass Boost for in the car & outside, and 3D for the ear buds.  Listening with the included earbuds is EXCELLENT.  Realiability has been excellent.  I've dropped it a couple times already but it's without a scratch.  Another reason I bought it was the good reviews (much better than Scan Disk).  There is a good video of the Samsung on C-Net, which show it's size and is described well. I've had the unit a little over a month now and it topped out at 800 WMA songs.  This was my first venture into the MP3 world and it's fantastic.  No more annoying songs or car commercials.  It's like TIVO for radio only better because it's free, commercial free and all your favorite songs are played, whenever and however you want.  Not in the mood for a song?  skip it for the next one.  Select albums, artists, songs, rock... country, pop, jazz, etc.  And the color changing clock is really a neat bonus. As for the cons, I would have liked the full manual and not the site to go get one in Adobe.  The touch pad requires a very light touch, but you get used to it.  Normal play is actually a little better than shuffle too, as in shuffle will try to sneak in a previously skipped track. Also, you must charge it through the computer..  There is not much in the way of accesories either.  I wound up going to Walmart where I bought a Samsonite cell phone cover and clip (fits a Nokia 3500) so I can wear it on the riding mower with the ear buds neatly tucked in ear protection. Last little gripe, you have to plug in the ear buds to receive FM, but you can still listen to the radio through speakers.  Pulls in a lot of distant stations with no fade. If you haven't guessed yet, I would buy this item again and HIGHLY recommend it! 
 This was an excellent book.  It brings us all back to traditional styles of dating, and traditional is what we need since this society has seen so much change in the last 40 years. The psyche has seen so much change that it doesn't know which end is up - especially in dating.  This book has solid information about the differences between genders and the whole point of dating.  I highly reccomend it, especially for young people starting out - it will pre-empt much grief.  
 I have The Forbidden Dance Is Lambada 1990 ON LASERDISC,'tis a Fun great Movie thats why I bought it on DVD too,A MUST SEE :p 
 I love to read books about people like me and I love short stories...this book put both into one and introduced me to a variety of writers I didn't know about along with ones I already did.  I ended up buying a couple more books because the short story was so interesting (ex. Douglass Women & Ain't nobody's business if I do).  It's a very good source for writers to show off and I thoroughly enjoyed it and tried to roll with the WHOLE book page by page 
 I bought this to accompany me on a trip to Guatemala.  Although it was painful to read, it absorbed me in the country's history in a very enriching way, and altered my perspective considerably.  I highly, highly recommend this book 
 Currently the best and famous OOAD books in markets. It covers detailed information and techniques(e.g. GRASP)on each steps for the whole process of analysing and designing OO applications and there're examples for illustration. A must of OO architect or equivalent 
 There seems to be an abundance of books out there on Abe Lincoln. However, this is the only book I saw that thoroughly detailed both him and his cabinet. Overall, I'm impressed with Ms. Goodwin's writing abilities. From what I can tell, and from what I've heard from another historian, she is tops in her field. Though a bit too detailed, this book is an excellent source of facts and stories surrounding President Lincoln and his "Team of Rivals". 4-Stars 
 I love it.  Brings back a lot of memories for me and when I walk the track, I don't have to change the CD.  It does the whole 3 miles 
 The only problem I have with this book is that I have written more notes bringing the text into my personal context than Goleman did on the pages themselves. I would suggest to Goleman that he consider at 1/3 blank column in future books to accommodate the reader's own in book blogging. Seriously, as usual, the book is illuminating and well written. There are good anecdotes that are easy to connect with and the insights offered are very useful. A good read worthy of much contemplation of what goes on around you. 
 I liked it! It helped me, and was packed full of info! You should really get it 
 It's definitely different. But it's not dry like some the others said. I think it's a much more mature recording than others I have heard and also enjoyed. I think it's the way that Bach is meant to be played. 
 I decorated my entire nursery with this theme and am so pleased I could not have found a better set than this one...I highly recommend this set to everyone.. 
 This book is a little more confusing and less well laid out than The American Pageant--the counterpart AP US History de facto standard to this AP Modern Euro text-and is certainly not witty, clever, or hilarious as the Pageant can be at times.  A History of the Modern World is a serious textbook for serious students of Modern European History, and does not suffer from the wishy-washy non-opinionated stances more recent textbooks demonstrate.  
 I like this book very much. As usual Chris Kimball gifts us his knowledge and expertise, along with wonderful stories and thoughts. So then, with all his expertise and knowledge...why does Christopher Kimball mess up so horribly in the index? I spent 30 mintues trying to find a recipe for cinnamon rolls. Then I gave up and went to my old standard The Farm Journals Baking Book. The index is one powerful tool in any book like this...we need an index. If there is an order to it I have yet to figure it out. When I want or need a recipe I want to be able to find it right now, not waste a huge chunk of time searching for the subject 
 While this tiny book does offer some important truths, it could be made even smaller if the author's central theme of color "spots" was not on nearly every single page.   My only other complaint is about that the reviews of students' paintings which comprises a large part of this small work. They are not nearly as helpful as they would be if there was some attempt at describing them a little more thoroughly than "Model in red sweater." (There are no graphics of any type in the entire book.)  Still, there is enough truth in this booklet to make it a must if you paint in anything approaching a representational style, (or want to) 
 Mariah Carey's Music Box album is by far her masterpiece! This album is hot, hot, hot. This is truly Mariah at her best, what a voice. Standout tracks include: Dreamlover, All I Ever Wanted, Without You, Just to Hold you Once Again, and Now That I Know. The rest of the tracks are gorgeous as well. Beautiful arrangements, catchy fun lyrics, and music that speaks to every young girl in America. Too bad Mariah has completely lost the magic now, her voice is lifeless and thin, her image is so contrived and and her personality just screams pampered diva. But believe me Music Box is pure and utter greatness from once a gifted and beautiful woman. Get this album today, it's a true gem 
 Don't feel like a philistine.  Don't scratch your head and wonder what is the matter with you for not appreciating the world's great literature.  Just read this book and it will all come clear.  In all likelihood, your literature teacher didn't know how to teach.  Rosenblatt's thesis is that without a pro-active, supportive environment in which a novice reader is credited for those things he or she can discern from his/her experience, knowledge, intuition, and reasoning, the most erudite transfer of knowledge from a 'professional' reader to a novice will at best be a delivery of information not unlike the role the pizza guy performs in bringing you your pizza and at worst, promoting a self-doubting reader who will not feel comfortable with his or her own insights.  Assuming that a prime reason for reading literature is to sense the 'transpersonal' between writer and reader, anyone who can read should be able to make that connection since we are all human.  Of course, expert knowledge and scholarship have their place, but not the first place.  The primary place is within, and it is the job of the promoter of 'literature' to help the student find that place within himself or herself--not demean the unenlightened to exact revenge for all those years of torturous graduate school. 
 Although I like this book a great deal, I wanted to warn unwary future customers--this is the same book as Meal-Lean-i-Yumm.  I was really excited to see this title, and thinking it was a new book by Norene Gilletz, I ordered it right away.  When it arrived today, imagine my disappointment when I discovered it was simply a retitled version of a cookbook I've had for four or five years already.  Anyway, the book is great--just don't buy it twice unnecessarily 
 This book is a review of current (as of 1987) research about honey bees.  Topics covered include: origin and evolution, anatomy, development and nutrition, nest architecture activities of worker bees, pheromones, communication and orientation, collection of food, reproduction, mating, and differences between temperate an tropical honey bees.  The book includes numerous black-and-white illustrations, a long-list of references, an author index, and a subject index.    Readers will come away from this book with a much greater understanding of these vital insects, encompassing everything from range to communication to gender roles.  The book is written in clear language that is accessible to general readers as well as undergraduate students. Interested readers can use the cited references to learn about specific topics in greater detail.  
 The Jesus Dread compilation of Yabby U's work is one of the most important top 10 at least reggae albums anyone should own.  Crafted like a fine architect, this album reflects all that reggae music is about.  TRUTH.  Beyond the hype of what's good reggae and Bob Marley (no pun intended) if you don't have Yabby You, you don't have reggae 
 I purchased this case along with the Coby DVD 8500 portable player...the player fits nicely...but after filling the accessory holder with the AC adapter, earphones and remote there is scant room for DVD's...better get a separate holder for your discs! 
 I own three CD's by these guys and all of them are good, but the songs Chant, Monterey, Between The Sheets, Flying East, and Amoroso make this fabulous Foreplay!!! Their isn't a bad song on this one.  Their music is relaxing and not boring.  These fellows are excellent musicians!!!  
 I had no idea just how lucky I were that day long time ago, when I flicked on the telly and happened to stumble across an episode of "Little Britain". It had me in stitches. And it has had me in stitches ever since.   The sketches and the characters are original (well, they're basically just blokes dressing up as girls and such, but in a new way:-) and they take it straight to the limit, as for example with the young chap who fancies older women (the finale of that particular series of sketches is at the same time some of the most hilarious and revolting I've ever seen). Who can keep a straight face when you see (and more importantly hear) Matt Lucas in the shape of Vicki Pollard ramble on about nothing and anything and nothing again? Or Andy making Lou's days a "straight keffufle"? Even the narration of the series is enough to get me laughing out loud. Tom Baker does an absolutely fantastic job of narrating utter nonsense.  I've heard people mention the monotony of the sketches. Seen one you've seen 'em all. That is true. David Walliams in fact commented on that very thing in an interview once: you know exactly what's gonna happen. However, these are characters and indeed sketches, that dosen't wear easily. I've seen them all many times, and I still laugh every time. They are simply funny, no matter how many times you see them (well, within reason of course).  This is some of the best comedy to hit the tube for a long, long time. It dosen't matter whether you're wathcing this solo, with your misses or with the lads, it's always a winner 
 This book is not for the beginning handicapper, but has some of the best information in it of any handicapping book I have read. Most books just give you information about how smart they were to make certain picks, but little knowledge is given to the reader. Beyer tries to pass on information from many years as a professional handicapper. I wish he would write a handicapping book that would have racing forms for 4 or 5 days, then show you how they break down the races to make their selections, not with programs they want to sell. It would be interesting to see the steps a professional handicapper goes through to handicap all races for a track, if they would bet it or pass it 
 Having taught many seminars over the past seven years on Spiritual Gifts and having helped hundreds of people to find thier unique call to ministry through their giftedness, I found this little book to be a treasure of  information. It succinctly describes the value of helping church members  discover thier gifts and function out of them, leading to fulfilling and  enthusiastic service for the Kingdom of God. Church leaders who have read  this book in our setting have stopped looking for just "warm breathing  bodies" to fill a position, but instead look for a person whose  giftedness qualifies them for it and therefore classic burn-out is kept at  a minnimum.  Peter Wagner is easy to read and speaks clearly to the lay  person 
 "Demons and Wizards" is one of the most underrated heavy metal/progressive rock albums to be released in the early 70s. The album solidified their reputation as the progressive rock innovators that they were. From the short, concise pop/rock songs ("The Wizard", "Easy Livin'"), to the lengthy epic art rockers ("Circle of Hands", "Paradise/The Spell"), Uriah Heep constructed an album that will carry their reputation as one of the best gothic/metal bands ever. Although they had set the ground work for their signature sound on albums such as "Uriah Heep" (1970) and the underrated "Look at Yourself" (1971), "Demons and Wizards" towers above it's predecessors.  "The Wizard" sets the mood and rhythm for the entire album. Starting off with a simple acoustic guitar rhythm, then building up to ear piercing rumblings; "The Wizard" is one of Uriah Heep's all time anthems. "Traveller in Time" and "Easy Livin'" as exceptional pieces of work too. The latter being their only hit that I know of; which peaked at #39 on the charts (I just heard it on the radio yesterday). "Rainbow Demon" is among my favorites. The album would have been less impressive without "Circle of Hands" and "Paradise/The Spell". Those epic rockers fill out the space nicely, with a lot of variety. The guitar and keyboard solos are very inventive. The wide range of vocals are exceptionally showcased.  The bottom line is, "Demons and Wizards" is an underrated classic. If you're into bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy, or even Kansas; you should definitely check this out 
 Control systems are a difficult subject to cover, but this book does a good job of bringing the novice reader up to speed. This is a very straightforward treatment of an extremely technical field, and while it  could hardly be described as gripping reading, Phillips has done a good job  of presenting the main concepts clearly and understandably. The book is  nicely divided into self-contained sections, allowing undergraduate  students to immediately identify those topics relevant to their course.  Probably the most useful textbook available to the undergraduate control  student 
 Considering the wide variety of things Mark Hamill has participated in, it's no wonder he'd be able to write a comic book as well!  There was a slight awkwardness to it mainly because the story was more set for a movie  screen, but the story was still very moving in the end!  It was definately  worth it and I can't wait until they make a movie 
 Much has been made about the enigmatic title of this novel, which reads, as others have said, more like a collection of inter-connected short stories, but that connection itself may be the key to this wonderful debut novel from a richly talented author.  Although the book ends perhaps two chapters too late, notwithstanding its mostly regrettable dip toward science fiction, each tells the story of a coherent whole which itself is entertwined into a larger whole best described by the end of one of those stories: "Finally I understand...how the forces that hold (us) together are one."  We ghostwrite our own lives in our hopes and ambitions; we merely are characters within the complex fiction of time.  Or, as another of the characters says: "Does chance or fate control our lives?  Well, the answer is as relative as time.  If you're in your life, chance.  Viewed from outside, like a book you're reading, it's fate all the way."  Ghostwritten is one of the best American novels I've read in many years and places Mitchell squarely among the best novelists writing in English today 
 John Hughes strikes gold with this hit classic.This film is about five kids who show at their high school for Saturday detention.While there,they open up to each other and express their feelings,putting up with each other and evading their wily principal(Paul Gleason).High-strung humor and laughs blend with superb storytelling as The Breakfast Club(Starring Judd Nelson as Bender,Molly Ringwald as Claire,Ally Sheedy as Allison,Anthony Michael Hall as Brian,and Emilio Estevenz as Andrew)are hillarious!A pleasant all-around film 
 Ive been reading the cat who books for a couple of months and if you like cats and mystery then this is really good for you.They are so hard to put down 
 Throughout the last couple of weeks, my class has been studying much ado about nothing. Shakespear was an amazing writer in my opinion. He is able to write so little, yet get his entire, deep point across. The play was called much ado about nothing because throughout the entire play there was fighting and crying and decieving.. and for what? Nothing. I beleive that i learned a lot from it. Not only about Shakespeares sytle of writing, but about love too. To answer the question whats shakespeares purpose for writing, i had to think carefully. But I beleive that his point of writing was to show the real meaning of love. Throughout the entire play, there were people loving each other and not knowing it, and loving each other but not knowing each other.. and it was just a huge mess. Claudio and Hero had "love at first site" but Claudio beleived what he thought he saw Hero doing on a roof, which proves that he didnt know her as well as he should to love her. So I think that Shakespeare makes you wonder if their love was true or not. This story had many values in it that one could learn. I, personally learned something very important to which I had not seen before-  How easily people mistake love for lust. An example of this would be when Claudio and Hero met. They had no idea who each other were, not even something as simple as their names, yet they were "in love". I do not see how you can possibly be in love with someone from first site. That is called lust. I also learned something very important to which I had not seen before- How stupid people act when they are in love. An example of people acting weird and stupid when they are in love would be Benedict and Beatrice. At first, they hated each other. The play starts out with them being cruel, rude, and sarcastic to one another and the reader knows there is something between them. Then, when they are both deceived and told that they love one another, they start prancing around like fairies. Although this is funny, it is very weird and confusing at the same time that their emotions towards each other can just change automatically. Another example would be at Claudio and Hero's second wedding. After all of this love talk, when their love is put out into the public, they start to deny it and say they are just friends. Love makes them act so weird, but they end up deciding to be together which I believe is for the good. This play is not extremely hard to understand, yet has a meaningful story. It is written in old english so that is probably the most difficult thing to understand about it. I would recommend it to someone who could use a good laugh because of all the comic relief in it. There is loads of sarcasm and its written in an interesting way. After all, it is Shakespeare. I would not, however, recommend this book to someone who is expecting a deep, poetic, tragic story because they are simply not going to get it. This story isn't complex nor is it deep. It is all, really, just much ado about nothing. I enjoyed the book, one; because I could understand what was going on throughout the whole thing, and two; because the writing is funny and it kept me entertained. So, Id really recommend it to anyone 
 Debbie never disappoints me.  Entertaining and enjoyable reading as all of her books have been.  Especially interested in the Pacific northwest.  My son has climbed Ranier and hiked the Wonderland Trail and has always talked about the panoramic scenery and natural beauty of the area. Debbie creates memorable characters that become dear to  your heart and you want to continue to read about.  Wish the sequel wasn't months away 
 "El-Hazard: The Magnificent World" is an anime very much in the "Tenchi Muyo!" mold: a romantic comedy/adventure in which blank-slate protagonist Makoto is thrust into a sci-fi scenario and gets to play hero while being chased by multiple women. Though the characters in "El-Hazard" aren't developed as deeply as the "Tenchi" crew and the show occasionally suffers from awkward pacing, "El-Hazard" has a charm all it own. The mysterious antiheroine Ifurita is compelling, and the kids' hard-drinking teacher Fujisawa is consistently funny. Most impressively, "El-Hazard" tells a complete and satisfying story, tying up its seeming plot holes with an ingenious last-episode twist. Usually these types of shows start strong, only to end up limping through anticlimaxes and false endings. Even the romantic tension is unambiguously resolved!  The dub is also pretty darn good, though it tends to get overly shouty, especially in the segments centering on Jinnai. Can't the guy ever just speak in a normal tone?  "El-Hazard" is hardly the type of show that will change your life, but if you like "Tenchi" or other anime in this vein, this box set is probably a good bet. (The set actually contains two separate shows: the original "El-Hazard" OAV and its 4-episode sequel "El-Hazard 2." The sequel is an inconsequential side story that unfortunately doesn't really add any value.) 
 A comprehensive collection of cartographic information related to Armenian History and Geography.  The acompaning text is also very informative 
 It's an extremely good movie. I love how the fight scenes are in short intervals with the story 
 This was the first time that I purchased a Kelly Price CD.  Kelly has a lovely voice and the CD is out of this world. I listen to it 8 hrs a day. A lot of the Xmas songs bring about real life meaning . Kelly is truly a blessing to the music industry. Keep of the good work 
 When you were in high school did your family ever make you want to move as far away as humanly possible?  You know when they won't let you go to one of the biggest social events of the year. You say everything you can think of: everyone will be there, if you don't let me go it'll ruin by reputation and so on.  That frustrated you so bad that you swore you were going to college on the other side of the world.  If you've ever felt that way then you have something in common with Vince Luca.  Son of the Mob is a hilarious book that gives you a behind the scene look at the "life."  Vince Luca  the leader of the mob's son, when gets old enough to figure out what his father really does for a living, he makes the decision that he wants to have a part in the business or the life. He also wants buy the thing he wants with clean money.  After school one day Vince and his girlfriend Kendra are going to his car, when he gets there he finds someone from his father's business waiting for him, Jimmy the Rat.  The reason for Jimmy's presence is to ask Vince if he could get his father to give him a few more days.   This one little conversation leads to many more fiery situations.  After a handful of secret meetings, countless payphone calls, and a few Luca stares, Vince finally wiggles his way out of the "life."  Now he can focus his budding relationship.  No matter how far our family makes us want to move away there's one thing that will never change, they'll always be our FAMILY.  The author, Gordan Korman, sets up the perfect example of a high school boy just dying to get out of his house and on his own.    Son of the Mob is a great book for anyone looking for a funny read with a hint of seriousness.  It's wonderful for junior high students whose parents are driving them crazy, or maybe their family has a business and it messes with their life.  This book would also be good for someone who loves a sweet little love story.  This book has about everything that an excellent book needs.          
 Not suggested for anyone with a short attention span.  This is a massive accomplishment bringing the A to Z of occultism under one literary umbrella.  An astonishing find 
 Exploring the issues that captivate the minds of men, really! ... easy and good reading from a pastor, with examples taken from his own life .. very honest and revealing -- I've read it and I've recommended it to several  other men, who have also enjoyed it. It was a good way to open up to each  other and really start discussing what really is on our minds 
 Inspiration Information is a watershed album! Not only does this album defy classification, it is arguably one of the most deviceful musical efforts in modern auditory history. It is, without doubt, one of the most creative pieces of art that I own. Otis created an alcove all his own; definitely a byproduct of free reign in the studio, as the music is all over the place, yet right where it needs to be at exactly the right moment. Inspiration Information is a hallmark example of the types of auditory beauty that emerge from creative carte blanche.   I don't care where you're musical allegiances rest, if you have a penchant for musical creativity devoid of a provincial ear...get this album. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. This is American, world, and human artistry at its best. A definite must have for the discerning listerner. 
 I really, really liked the British version of "The Office", but was open to enjoying an American take on the concept.  And I'm happy to say that the American version of the show is indeed a lot of fun.  The new show smartly carries over the big selling points of the British original, namely the clueless boss, the ridiculous office situations, and those long pregnant pauses and awkward silences when a character can't believe what another character (usually the boss) has just said or done.  But, also smartly, the writers and actors are also permitted to tweak and adapt the original British characters so that the new characters aren't just carbon copies of the original ones, only without British accents.  So, for example, Steve Carell is still a clueless boss, but a different kind of clueless boss than Ricky Gervais' David Brent character.  Carell, like the other new actors here, get to play to their individual strengths to create new, interesting, fun characters.  This first season set is a painless, inexpensive way to see if this new version of "The Office" is for you.  You get a small handful of episodes (the first season was a short one) for a dirt-cheap price.  Be warned, though... you'll likely want to quickly pick up the second season-- the first full-length season-- shortly thereafter, and that costs a little more.  Oh yeah... in this first-season set, don't judge everything by the pilot episode.  The pilot is perfectly watchable and has a few chuckles, but things don't really pick up until the second episode.  So do yourself a favor and watch the first two episodes during your first sitting.  That'll put you exactly where you need to be to savor the rest of the quick, fun ride that is season one of "The Office".        
 This is the most chilling story I have ever read.  I love stories where you can not always guess what comes next.  I actually had to reread some parts, just to understand the ending.  The ending is by far the best ending of a book.  It still leaves you guessing.  I am now a fan of Guy Burt.  Another great book from him is "The Hole".  That also has a great ending 
 I daresay that Mann's adaptation of the film is better than Cooper's book.  Expanded scenes are slight, but fun additions to the a fantastic film 
 If I had to pick one system to play exclusively, based on several factors, I'd choose the DS. Now, I'm glad I have the option (i.e. money) to keep purchasing home consoles, but if in some bizarro world where I could only take one system... well, you get the idea. In a way, the DS reminds me of the PS2. It's a bargain. It's backwards compatible so it plays GBA game. The games are abundandt and perhaps more importantly they are varied and around $30. You can't go wrong 
 Get fit watching the TV news. Get fit on rainy days when you can't get out for your walk. Get fit sitting at a computer. (I'm going to do the "sitting at computer" exercises as soon as I finish writing  this.) I borrowed the book from the library, and I am buying it 
 I suppose I'll lose points on cleverness and critique, but...I read the first page of the first story, and bought the book on that alone; halfway though, it provoked a rare "damn, I'm really glad I bought this book" moment. That's all I'm really looking for in a book anyhow. ***UPDATE 4/18: driving in to work I started randomly thinking about the story "craphound" from this collection...so I guess you could say Doctorow has stay-time, considering it's been a year since I read it and it still occasionally bounces around my brain 
 What a great book filled with positive diet tips from people that have lost the weight.  Great advice to read over and over again! It's perfect reinforcement for when the going gets tough!   
 Leading with the Heart is a guide to leadership in the business world and the sports world. Coach K talks about how leadership is gained and then how you use it to your advantage. He refers to his "fist" which is the guide to all things that are basketball and business related. He talks about getting to the top in whatever you are involved in, and how to do it with class. If you are a businessman half-heartedly interested in basketball, you should read this book about how to lead your organization to the peak of its performance level.  It is written well, with an outline before every four chapters to help the reader understand what he is going to talk about. He also included tips to remember after every chapter about the important characteristics every leader must have. However, I would not recommend it for a young ball player interested in Duke basketball. It does not discuss specific games and the strategies behind them nearly enough for a young person to enjoy. It does not talk about the plays that were used in the games, nor does it discuss the opposition. It is somewhat misleading because when someone sees Coach K on the cover he instantly thinks the book is about basketball and the strategies behind it, while it really discusses how business leaders can find a way to encourage their employees to be the best they can be. This book is specifically for a business leader who needs advice from one of basketball's most successful coaches about how to lead his organization to the top. This is a business book about how to get to know the people in your organization and how the leader of an organization can learn to have a trusting relationship with his employees. 
 An Informative and amusing look at the English language in its many forms 
 Jeffrey T. Richelson chronicles the efforts the United States has made to deal with the threat of atomic and nuclear weapons from they were first conceived in the 1930s and `40s through the gathering of intelligence.  You know, spying.  The building of our own (the United States') nuclear arsenal is well chronicled in other books.  This volume is more about the kinds of methods that were developed in the human intelligence and technical intelligence areas and the debates that have raged over the decades in interpreting the meaning of what was found out.  I found the gradual growth of the intelligence bureaucracy and how each component of the CIA versus the State Department versus the Military became predictable in its interpretation of evidence of nuclear activity fascinating and distressing.  It is hard to have confidence that our nation is getting a handle on the threats facing us when intelligence interpretation is more about turf wars than truly understanding what is happening in the laboratories and processing plants of our enemies.  While the book does discuss the development of sampling the atmosphere for the minute quantities of by products unique to nuclear activity and the particles that are the residue of a nuclear explosion, the acoustic infrasonic signatures of nuclear blasts, the satellite detection of light signatures, gamma ray production, photographic evidence of infrastructure and activities signaling the enrichment of uranium or the collection and processing of plutonium through flyovers by spy planes and specialized satellites, it also discusses the problems associated with gathering human intelligence in the various regimes.  Even when you get evidence from someone on the ground, one has to not only verify the validity of the information provided, but also consider carefully the motives of the person supplying the information.  It becomes a very complicated series of issues very quickly.  Adding to the difficulty is that those who desire to develop these weapons usually want to do so in great secrecy until they successfully explode a nuclear device.  They have learned a lot about the capabilities of our satellites and the habits of interpretation by our intelligence services.  So, they design their facilities to look as much like something legitimate as they can.  They take facilities underground.  They build decoys that look hidden, but are designed to hold attention.  At times, they are even good enough to fool the watchdogs that come on site to inspect.  For example, in the old days, inspectors measured the total radiation of fuel rods being shipped.  One Asian country wanting enriched uranium got around this by building fuel rods of the proper weight and size and radiation, but using smaller pieces of enriched uranium spaced with aluminum filler.  Another shaped the dirt covering the blast site (to ensure no radiation escaped into the atmosphere) so that it looked as if was created by the prevailing wind so the satellite photo interpreters would be less likely to pick up on it.  Obviously, I can't recount everything that is covered in 544 pages.  However, the last three chapters do cover current events with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.  The author shows clearly how the present administration was not served well by competition between intelligence services.  I found the discussion of the infamous aluminum tubes quite enlightening.  Iraq orders 60,000 extremely engineered aluminum tubes.  Why?  One analyst at the CIA sees them as centrifuge tubes.  He even tests them as such and finds a way to make one spin at high enough rpms to function as one.  Other agencies point out that the proportions are wrong for centrifuge tubes and they are indeed similar to the missile bodies Iraq had used in the past.  However, the tubes are too hard and the tolerances are overly precise for rockets.  Is Iraq simply living with inefficiency to get away with enriching uranium?  Or was Saddam himself the victim of his own agencies?  Did he order the program restarted, and his crooked bureaucrats ordered these things to make him think they were doing something but secretly benefiting themselves somehow?  Who knows.  All the certainty you here from various parties is evidence of their political position rather than any real expertise in intelligence analysis.  What I come away with is a sense that we really do need to reform our intelligence services to make sure we are focused on gathering intelligence and interpreting it as well as we can with as few turf wars and bureaucratic wrangling as we can.  The daunting task is that the reforms have to be done by the same bureaucrats who are fighting over power and turf now.  Who wants to give up power?  And just because one group wins over another in no way indicates that the better and more reliable group won the fight.  It simply means that the better political infighter was rewarded.  Some say that we are too focused on nuclear weapons.  That a single nuclear weapon cannot take down the United States.  While that is likely true, it isn't the direct assault that is the real threat for America.  It is if a bomb goes off in a place and in a way that draws America into a war the way the Allies were all drawn into World War I through a seemingly small act.  We have to be focused on these nations and what they are up to on this front.  Of course, we must do the other things, too.  Nobody said being a Superpower was easy work.  Of course, nations will act in their own interests.  What is interesting, and adds to the complexities, is how the political factions within each nation (including ours) will interpret, leak, and promote various activities contrary the plans of those in power.  From what we have seen leaked to the press in the past few years, it appears that our own intelligence bureaucracies are rife with this contrarian activity.  A fascinating and informative work.  You cannot consider yourself informed on this subject by what you hear and read in the mainstream media.  This book is certainly one you should read.  And the background it will give you will help you decipher sense from nonsense when you hear someone talking about nuclear issues on the tube 
 I taught this 7 week course a dozen years ago.  I've not found anything on the subject of parenting that is more hands on in the years since.  In a society of adults who are rapidly losing their ability to parent adequately, this is a must have for parents.  You discover how to set reasonable boundaries, create a more cohesive and cooperative family unit.  You are able to see your reactions in direct relation to your child's behavior and help both of you shift to a healthier expression.   In this system you look at the motivating behavior your child is showing.  You are given clear, understandable directions for responding to your child.  You learn the difference between allowing your child enough freedom to fall and learn to get back up and supporting your child to achieve what he or she wants or stay safe.  I've read all of the STEP books, but this one is where I'd start.  I was always amazed and humbled at the growth and change in entire family units after parents dedicated themselves to learning how to parent 
      K-19 The Widowmaker is a great dramatic depiction of this real life event from 1961, when a Soviet nuclear sub almost had a meltdown.  Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson rise to the occassion by making it believable and intense.  Ford portrays the overly harsh commander and Neeson the captain in touch with the men.  Probably the best submarine movie there is, especially when compared to the ridiculous "Crimson Tide" and "U-571".  The cold war aspect pervades the film and the men heroically risk their lives stopping a nuclear meltdown. 
 To the reviewer that mentioned that object to the use of the terms BCE and CE ( Before Common Era / Common Era Vs. Before Christ and Anno Domini - BC/AD) . I would like to say that this IS a very important change in my mind ( and in many others as well!) It is not as you say just a PC term. ( though on the surface it may seem so. It's about the fact that our study of Western History has always been based on a male, Christian point of view! That has been very important to how we've understood the past several thousand years. In order to take a new look at that history and to not continue to make those mistakes historinas are attemting to take a more inclusive point of view. Addmitedly this can sometimes ( perhaps often) go too far the other wayin one way or the other. The neutral term though of CE, and BCE I think make it so that we are at least making a nod to the fact that the defining moment in the history of the world ( in Christian religion yes, but not the history of the world in a larger view) is the birth of Jesus! I think that's a very important point! I'm sure that many Christians wouldn't want to be measured by a dating system based on the birth of a Roman Emperor ,Muhammad, A Druid Priest , or the supposed birth date of Merlin??? I know many would argue- that it's not the same thing at all, but other might. SO the neural system is a good idea. Just as are many aspects of chaging the perspective with which we look at history.  by the way, the review that I originally read this in that began this I really liked and because of it I'm going to buy the book, so thanks 
   I bought this thing for my new nephew and I'm satisfied, his parents told me That was the best gift they received, I recommend it, excellent product 
 Dan Finnerty (husband of famed comic actress Kathy Najimy!) has taken a gimmic (boys singing girl songs without changing the pronouns) and played it straight, much to the audience's benefit.  He doesn't try to channel Laura Brannigan, Abba or Britney Spears, he sings like a macho guy (and quite well) trying to do these songs justice in the conviction department. The result is hilarious. Throw in a few F-words and you will rolling on the ground!  If you like Wm. Shatner's "Has Been," any of Richard Cheese's lounge covers, or the equally wacky band Nouveau Vague, you will eat this S**T up with a spoon.   What makes this band hip is that Finnerty doesn't just serve up feminist anthemics like "I Am Woman," but also current radio faves like Kelis's "Milkshake." Also, the many medleys offered her are inspired, like the Wilsons' "Hold on" mixed with Suzanne Vega's "Luka," turning the originals' sappiness into rock-n-roll happiness!  
 Few sequels live up to the predecessor, but THE SUBTLE KNIFE does exactly that. In this volume, Pullman dives deeper into the themes,settings and characters presented in THE GOLDEN COMPASS. As in the first installment, the setting is well realized and the emotions are deftly rendered. As in  all of Pullman's works,the characters are vibrant and engaging, and will leave an inprint on readers memories. I can only hope the third book will be as good as the first two.  RATING: 
 K. Kingsbury is a genius in her ability to bring us real life changing fiction.  Forever makes you look at your relationships with an eye that goes beyond your own needs and puts those of your friends and love ones first!  The characters are the people in your own circle of family and friends.  Maybe not in job type but in heart and character.  Learning how to apply biblical principals to the here and now of living life.    I recommend both the "Redemption" and the "Firstborn" series to anyone who wants to learn to trust Jesus more for the everyday things of life 
 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' is a haunting and strange poem. The great memorable lines of the opening , ' It is an ancient mariner / and he stoppeth one of three/ by the long grey beard and thy glittering eye / wherefore thou stoppest thou me?/ lead us to a kind of enchanted and impossible world. The tale itself of the slaying of the albatross of the cosmic coordination in response to the evil of Man has a certain Biblical flavor which connects the story with Jonah . The work as a whole I have always found perplexing in its ultimate meaning, but strong in its great poetic lines. (Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink)  In another great poem in this collection ' In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree ' Coleridge 's great musical power and mystical sense is again felt .This scattered man of ideas this long- suffering lonely genius the incredible master of the mind's digression, this supreme talker and goer- on- and -on did in his youth also write great poetry .  There is much much beauty here amid the musings and meanderings of this great wandering and wondering mind.  
 I am an Arkansan and a Southerner, and this book provides great insight into Southern culture. Adler shows the reader what happens when people are denied fair treatment. He takes the reader on a journey from a small Arkansas town to a large Northern drug empire. The reader will be a much better person for having taken the trip 
 Great reminder of the time, very funny, great music,great actors, just worth it in every way 
 I read this book as a young girl as part of my assigned reading in school.  I could not put the book down.  I loved the book so much, I rushed off and read Huckleberry Finn.  I even dressed up as Tom Sawyer for Halloween that year.  Every child should read this book.  
 For all those "believers" who have rated this item negatively: read 1 Corinthians 3:1  and may the Lord bless you with understanding & remember his Commandment to Love & not to condemn 
 This is more than a score for a film, it is classical music deserving of the highest respect.  Echoing sentiment of many others based on his early works, I, too, thought Philip Glass was just another minimalist experimenters with a limited ouvre.  But time and time again, especially with powerful scores notably; The Truman Show, Fog Of War and now, The Illusionist, I believe Philip Glass proves his place among the finest composers of our time, period.  The richness of the composition matches the sheer size of the orchestra.  I only wish I could been for the the actual recording.  It is an exciting prospect to imagine what Mr. Glass will create in the future.  There is no doubt in my mind that  the Maestro will continue to surprise and satisfy.  Bravo!! 
 This movie gets your attention from beginnig to end. The ending would make your mouth drop. It is a twisted movie that you would never expect such a thing to happen in the movie 
 This is an awesome book to include in any first aid kit.  I run my own outdoor adventure business and typically include this book in all of my first aid kits.  It is concise and easy to understand, not to mention an  invaluable reference in the backcountry 
 This is a wonderful CD if you are just falling in love or getting over someone.  Vince Gill has the smoothest voice and there is a lot of variety on the CD--fast songs along with the slow songs that keep it from being too sappy.

 In EMMA BROWN, author Clare Boylan takes two chapters of an unfinished novel left behind by Charlotte Bronte and turns them into a complete novel.  In doing so, she incorporates other pieces of Bronte's writing, including a short story published by her husband after her.  The result, while perhaps not what Bronte herself intended (we'll never know), is a rich, multi-layered novel that makes for an engaging read.  The novel's title character, Emma Brown, is introduced early in Bronte's opening chapters as Matilda Fitzgibbon, a young girl of about 13.  Her background lies in shadow, although it soon becomes clear that she is not who she was pretending to be at the small, exclusive school for girls where she was residing.  However, something about Matilda (later Emma) intrigues a local gentleman, William Ellin, who agrees to help her discover her way.  He enlists the assistance of his friend and local widow, Isabella Chalfont (who also serves as the book's narrator).  In an effort to draw Emma out, Mrs. Chalfont shares her own experience as a young girl; later, the reader gets a glimpse into Mr. Ellin's past as well.  Then, as Emma's own history unfolds, we begin to learn that these three stories are surprisingly connected.  Boylan's plot definitely becomes a bit TOO coincidental at this point, but by then, I was so engrossed in the lives of these three characters that I didn't mind.  Although I can't vouch for whether this book will please fans of Charlotte Bronte, I do think that most fans of historical fiction would enjoy it, and thus I would not hesitate to recommend it 
 These are so awesome!  I never have a concern that my son is cold or will get strangled with blankets. One night I had the sleep sak in the laundry and it was a cool night, so I put a blanket over him - well my husband checked him in the middle of the night and found the blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe that our son was still breathing.  Very scary.  So if anything, make sure you have more than one sleep sak.  
           Yes, he's a Tony  Award winner for his Broadway role in Glengarry Glen Ross, an Emmy nominee for his television appearances and a star of feature films.   Nonetheless, for this listener Joe Mantegna is the voice of Robert Parker's iconic hero, Boston PI Spenser.  This actor has brought excitement and thrills to such Spenser escapades as Back Story, Bad Business, Cold Service, Hugger Potshot, and Widow's Walk.  He does it again with Hundred-Dollar Baby.  	There's little that ruffles Spenser but the reappearance of April Kyle does.  She was once a teenage runaway (Ceremony, 1982) who had the beauty and nerve to turn to prostitution because she believed she had no other choice.  She learned her trade well and now is back in Boston running a high priced bordello.  Problem is some men are trying to muscle in on her territory and she needs Spenser's help.  	Well, April may be beautiful and clever, but she's not too candid as Spenser soon discovers.  She had maintained that she had no idea who was trying to scuttle her operation but Spenser and his trusty sidekick, Hawk, find that April isn't the unknowing victim that she claims to be.   	Another top flight story in this ever popular series.          - Gail Cook 
 Applying Ethics is a wonderful introductory text.  My freshmen enjoy it as compared to other books because of its readable essays, helpful outlines, and current examples; while I appreciate its logical depth and comprehensiveness.  Excerpts of major philosophers were selected carefully to provide a representative glimpse of a theory without overwhelming the new student.  The editors were wisely unafraid to select topical essays which sometimes take a more unusual and philosophically solid position on a 'popular' issue.  Topical overviews are concise and precise, while outlining all major positions.  My only criticism is that Olen fails to present Rawls himself before providing Bayer's critique (which is, by the way, sufficient reason in itself to buy the book) 
 As a current Weight Watchers member, I was interested in reading this book to see how the program "used" to be - what types of foods people used to eat on this program.  This is a collection of Weight Watchers recipe cards from the 1970s.  My Weight Watchers leader joined the program in the 1970s, so I bought the book for her, thinking she might recognize some of the recipes and get a kick out of seeing how much the program has changed since then.  I read the book quickly and plan on giving it to her soon and now I want to buy a copy for myself.  The pictures and commentary are absolutely hilarious!  I was literally LAUGHING OUT LOUD!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is or has been on any kind of diet.  Really makes you realize what stupid things we will do to "lighten up" a recipe!  
 I first read this book when I was in 8th or 9th grade and was enjoying social leperdom at my high school. I think it is one of the most absorbing, accurate fictional accounts of teenage life ever written. In the past 15 or 16 years, I've read this book at least 10 times, and it never gets old. Our herione, Chelsea, is new in town and is in the throes of teenage-itis. She hates her mom, she's trying to dress punk, she's trying to keep her head down at her new school . . . but then beautiful, untouchable Ashley Packard singles her out for friendship, and so begins Chelsea's battle to not lose herself in Ashley's pretentious and even dangerous social world. With some help from her offbeat friend Pod, she may stand a chance of graduating from high school with her integrity intact.   I just love this book - the plot, the characters, the dialogue - a masterpiece from Richard Peck. What a shame it's not in print anymore! I think today's teenage girls need this story just as much, if not more than I did. 
 James Gleick has definitely done his homework, which always makes for good reading.  But, while he seemed to point to the "acceleration of just about everything" as a problem with humanity, he didn't really offer any solutions. In fact, as I trudged through the book, I felt increasingly vindicated for my "accelerated" lifestyle. I even picked up some good time-saving tips from the book. All told, the book was thought provoking and the ending capped it off nicely - however abruptly.  
 Jill Lepore's New York Burning: Liberty, Slavery And Conspiracy In 18th Century Manhattan receives a vivid reading by Beth McDonald and tells of an 18th century conspiracy by slaves to destroy New York City: a history nearly forgotten were it not for this vivid story. Audio brings the story to life in a way the written word is hard-pressed to compete with as it recreates events and rationale 
 An absoultely fabulous recording. I listened to this every night for years to help me sleep after a hectic day at the office, now I use it to put the baby down if she's a being fractious.  There is no sound that beats the heavy drenching rain with gentle rolls of thunder that consitute the middle (and majority) of the CD.  Even the budgie loves the beginning and end with various bird calls - now there is one for the whole family 
 If you are going to study Greek with the intent of using it you must purchase this book.  There is no alternative.  This is simply the best Greek New Testament on the market.  Nothing else comes close.  Other versions and editions exist.  They may be useful (though I haven't found them to be of much use), but this is THE scholarly edition 
 I think we all know that eating processed junk food is bad, but I have never seen the medical reasons described so well and in such a simple matter.  I blazed through the first half of the book day one and rushed out to whole foods to stock up on REAL food.  I trashed all of the processed junk in my cabinets and am making real progress in eliminating all of the poison from my life.  I highly reccomend the protein power shakes mentioned in the book and drink them religiously everyday 
 I teach strategic management to undergraduates at an Australian university and have used the 2nd and 3rd editions of this book in the past three years to supplement the theory from our prescribed texts. It is heavy going in some places for the students but I like the book's rigour. The only criticism I have is that the 4th edition I just received has some minor errors. For example, pages 20-21 in the "Economic Profit versus Acccounting Profit" section has errors in the figures quoted for economic profit for McDonalds and Starbucks. I think this has occured because the 3rd edition figures have been carried over to the 4th edition without a proper proof-reading. Another minor mistake is that Table 10.2 (page 329) should read "Five-Forces Analysis of the Commercial Aciation Industry" and not "Five-Forces Analysis of the Chicago Hospital Market". Sorry to be pedantic but I guess these things can detract from the perceived quality of an otherwise top-quality text. Please note I will be buying your next edition in a couple of years. Cheers from "DownUnder Australia! 
 Easy to follow, clear instructions and FUN 
 Karl Dahl allegedly committed three brutal murders at the Haas home and is about to go on trial for them. When Judge Carey Moore rules for the defense that his prior bad acts are inadmissible, all hell breaks loose for lots of people. She's beaten in the parking ramp after work the day of her ruling, the convict escapes, a police detective looses it and goes over the edge, the Judge is kidnapped, people turn up dead. The list of suspects for the beating and kidnapping is long. Minneapolis police detectives Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska learn more than they care to know about the Judge's family and the Haas family as they try to close this high-profile case.  There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested. Lots of characters, but no confusion about who's who. I hope the author can keep up the good work and give us more stories like this or even better. But keep do keep Kovac in line; I know this is fiction, but he was a tad unbelievable in this one 
 This book was great in introducing a unit on how the mail works to my second grade class.  I would definitely recommend it! 
 I love this book. Not only is it easy to read, but it gives you a level of detail that other game physics books don't. For example in the sports chapter not only does the book go over the equations that govern the collision of a golf ball and club but it also provides the coefficient of restitution between the golf ball and club. I get really frustrated by other books that don't give you all the information and then you have to search around for the missing pieces. This book gives you all the information you need to write realistic game programs. It's also packed full of interesting historical trivia 
 The year before THE DEAD ZONE was published, Stephen King published THE STAND, a stunning novel that is almost certainly King's finest work - which is no small achievement.  If THE STAND is not King's best, however, than THE DEAD ZONE probably is.  The plotline, as in most of King's stories, isn't breathtaking: a man awakens from a four-year coma with the ability to see the future and read a person's inner thoughts by touching them.  It's King's handling of that plotline that makes the book so utterly fantastic.  The chain of events in the book is immense and entirely unpredictable.  The characters and primarily their actions are unquestionably realistic - sometimes chillingly so.  The book revolves around two major points.  One point is explained through a question which torments the novel's protagonist, Johnny Smith: if you could travel in a time machine back to 1932, would you kill Hitler?  Would you be willing to be trapped in time and jailed (or, more likely, killed) to save the lives of millions of strangers who you don't even know?  More importantly, could you, will you, are you MEANT to, change fate?  This leads into the novel's second point.  You may believe in God, or you may not.  God you can run from.  Fate, however, is inescapable.  What is fate?  Is it destiny, or is it what God wants you to do?  Toward the end of the book, in a letter to his father, Johnny says, "I still don't really believe in God, not in a real Being who plans for us and gives us all little jobs to do, like Boy Scouts winning merit badges on The Great Hike of Life.  But neither do I believe that all the things that have happened to me are blind chance."  Johnny is torn between his desire to stay out of the public eye, to live in peace and not be hounded by the press or treated like a circus freak, and his urge to help those in trouble.  Ultimately, the urge to battle Greg Stillson, a politician who acts like a joke in front of the public but is privately nothing short of evil, overwhelms Johnny and leads him to make his final decision, which results in a shocking yet brilliantly fitting conclusion.  THE DEAD ZONE, like THE STAND, is concrete proof that Stephen King was the quintessential writer of the 20th century.  THE DEAD ZONE reflects on human society but also captures the feeling of its time period perfectly, most notably after Johnny awakens from his four-year coma to learn of all the changes in the world.  It's a brilliant novel, and undoubtedly one of the finest things the master author ever wrote.  
  In the "Eternity Code" Artemis Fowl starts off with a bang (literally) when a supercomptuer (The C-Cube) he built out of fairy helmet components is stolen by Jon Spiro, a ruthless buisinessman, and his bodyguard Arno Blunt. Butler is mortally wounded, and the faries underground city of Haven is in danger of exposure. So, Artemis tricks a LEPrecon agent, none other than Captian Holly Short, into coming aboveground to heal Butler. That is the summary of the first few chapters. Not many faries actually take a large part in the story except for Holly and Mulch Diggums. Foaly only comes in near the end and he's only on the comlink, so I don't know if that's an 'appearance' or not. Anyhow, the seemingly grim book is humorous at times. I loved when Artemis scared the waitress (must read to appreciate), Mulch's attempt at driving, and the scene when Pex and Chips try to 'bury Mulch deep'. The ending was kind of depressing, and I wondered if this was the end of the series, but I read it when book 4 wasn't even an internet rumor yet, although newcomers have the benifit of not having to wait 2 years (or however long it took) for the next one. Read the first two though, or you will be EXTREMELY confused. 
 This game although it can be fun, yet it can be quite tedious.  You will need a lot of patience to play it. 
 Kids climb trees.  Then they grow up and climbing trees is one of the things of childhood they put away.  Except some don't give it up.  Some keep it as a hobby, and some even make academic careers from climbing trees.  Richard Preston is the hobbyist kind.  He is better known as a nonfiction author of such bestsellers as _The Hot Zone_ and _The Demon in the Freezer_, scary nonfiction books about dangerous diseases.  He has turned his attention to tree-climbing, done by him and by professional and amateur tree enthusiasts in _The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring_ (Random House).  There are still scary stories here, because this isn't the sort of tree climbing that kids do.  These climbers take special equipment and haul themselves up the redwoods, 35 stories high.  Sometimes they fall, but the risk of the endeavor does not seem to the attraction.  They have a romantic obsession with the big trees; some of them have harnessed the obsession into academic papers and college careers, but others just climb to do so.  The tree canopy sounds like an enticing place, as Preston describes it, "a world between the ground and the sky, an intermediary realm, neither fully solid nor purely air, an ever-changing scaffold joining heaven and earth, ruled by the forces of gravity, wind, fire, and time."  Understandably, most of us aren't going to visit there, and most of us aren't going to meet the climbers who are smitten by the canopy, but Preston's lovely, enthusiastic descriptions of the climbers and the climbed make this an enticing report from a foreign world.  Botanists estimate that the bigger ones are over two thousand years old.  Many of the tree climbers here are motivated to find the one tallest tree (and by the end of the book, they do find it, but no tree and no record stands forever).  How tall a tree is would seem to be something easy to measure, but measuring a tree that is 360 feet tall to within an inch is a technical challenge.  The only real way to measure the height of a tree for documentation of record-breaking is to go up with a measuring tape.  There is more to such climbs, though, than breaking records.  No one had suspected, before people started climbing in the canopy and spending time there, that there was "what amounted to coral reefs in the air".  Not just redwoods are up there, but whole ecosystems based upon the trees, consisting of plants and animals that never come down, or that die if they do come down.  There are ferns, huckleberries, earthworms, and salamanders up there, and even other trees; hemlocks, laurels, spruces, and Douglas firs have all been found growing with roots hundreds of feet in the air.  The enthusiasts who scale these heights use specialized gadgets and ropes.  A hammock called a Treeboat is used for overnighting in the trees, but it is a good idea to keep an extra rope on yourself in case you roll out of bed during the night.  Preston has had to keep some of his secrets; the locations of some of the trees and groves he describes are given only in general terms to keep them from being tourist sites.  Recreational climbing will damage a tree; "a stray kick of a climber's boot, and centuries' worth of soil and plants could be knocked off a branch."   One of the most experienced climbers keeps his rope techniques classified, as he does not want recreational climbers to take advantage of them.    It isn't all biology and technology here.  The humans involved are more than just tree-huggers.  One is famous for finding the biggest trees, but has an intense and crippling fear of heights.  Steve Sillett climbed a redwood for a lark when he was nineteen, and has been climbing and writing scientific papers on the trees and the creatures they contain for the past thirty years.  Marie Antoine, a tomboy who climbed trees as a girl, did similar research, specializing on Lobaria itself.  Sillett and Antoine are the stars of the book, eventually dating high up in the branches; lovemaking in a Treeboat sounds complicated.  There was one big problem when they eventually got married: "The problem was to find a minister who could climb a redwood."  Preston himself describes his own process of learning to climb, and that of his family who took too it.  "I think it's very likely that we were the first tourists ever to visit Scotland to climb trees," he writes, and they were the first to explore the canopy of the Scotch pines there.  There are plenty of ecological lessons here, whether in Scotland or California, most of them having to do with how humans have been bad for the huge forests that used to cover the temperate zones.  The climbers, however, have the sort of love and respect for the trees, and the interest in learning about their biology, that may help preserve and expand the current protected stands.  Let us hope Preston's informative book helps, too. 
 "We'd forgive most things if we knew the facts," Assistant Police Commissioner Henry Scobie tells his wife Louise when she denounces young Pemberton, a recent suicide, for interrupting her life by requiring that her husband travel several days to investigate and report on the matter. In that simple sentence, Graham Greene captures the essence of human relationships and the kernel of his brilliant novel, THE HEART OF THE MATTER, as well as foreshadowing a host of events to follow. Not a half-page later, Greene describes his protagonist Scobie's own feelings, "He felt...the dreariness of a man who tries to write an important letter on a damp sheet and finds the characters blur."   The West Coast of Africa, Joseph Conrad's literal "heart of darkness," becomes for Graham Greene the landscape of hopelessness and despair, of lies compounded by deceit and murder. His hero, Henry Scobie, is a good man, fair and just in his handling of police matters and dealing with the ethnic carnival of Africans, Syrians, and assorted Britishers who surround him. Everyone in town knows Scobie is the only honest man thereabout. Yet it is his very honesty and desire to avoid pain in others, to manage their happiness, which causes people to despise him and his every action to backfire. He consistently confuses pity and love, living as a failed father, an adulterous husband, and a failed Catholic, a man without friends and ultimately without a God. Scobie himself ultimately recognizes that his every action, no more how well intended, results in the infliction of emotional if not physical pain on others, culminating in a tragic murder for which he was responsible even though he himself did not commit the act.   Graham Greene's coastal port is an Hieronymous Bosch setting, filled with human debris: the afflicted, the pettily pretentious, and the failed, with schemers and thieves and liars and murderers, and with those whose daily task is to convince themselves they matter for anything. Greene surrounds them with a hostile and unforgiving natural world, prone to torturous heat and endless rains and populated with all manner of symbolic death - fevers, diseases, suicides, vultures, cockroaches, lizards, ants, and mongrels. Even the streets of the town "stretched out on either side like the arms of a skeleton." Into this oppressive stew of decay he places his protagonist. Henry Scobie is a Christ figure whose forty days in the desert is passed in an incessant rainy season instead, who suffers (and succumbs) to the temptations of Satan (in the form of Helen Rolt and the Syrian, Yusef, who insists he only wants to be Scobie's friend), who questions his faith and doubts His Father's love. In the end, Scobie feels just as forsaken as Jesus on the cross. Only their resolution is different. Then again, perhaps not so different as they might seem, since Scobie justifies his climactic actions on their power to save those about whom he cared.   Yet in the end, despite all the secret messages and smuggled diamonds and human betrayals, THE HEART OF THE MATTER is a novel about one man's struggle with his Catholic faith. References to religion and religious belief permeate this book, with Scobie in particular struggling constantly to reconcile the demands of his faith with his desire to protect others. For Greene's hero, Catholicism offers nothing but impossible paradoxes. Catholics know the truth, in Scobie's estimation, and are therefore damned by their knowledge. "How often, he thought, lack of faith [in the form of Helen Rolt] helps one to see more clearly than faith." Scobie is too honest to confess behaviors he know he will repeat, yet he would rather commit mortal sin than hurt his wife Louise by admitting the truth of his adultery. "It's never good lying to oneself," Scobie tells Yusef. "One sees through the lie too easily." Finally, Scobie chooses escape and eternal damnation over confronting the mess he himself has made, ironically (for a policeman) failing miserably at what he conceived would be the perfect, face-saving crime. Heroic in his own confused mind, Scobie turns out to be as failed in life as he was in his faith. On yet another level, Scobie's tragicomic inabilities to discover the truth in his police cases or provide for the happiness of those around him offer metaphorical commentary on British (and all Western) colonial imperialism - inevitable unhappiness, harm, and even death despite the best of intentions. As Scobie himself notes, "no human being can really understand another, and no one can arrange another's happiness."   Greene's writing is masterful, creating a strong sense of place filled with a memorable supporting cast - the deviously slimy Wilson, the ineffectual Catholic priest Father Rank, the outlandishly pathetic Harris and Bagster, the dubious Yusef, the social climbing Louise, Scobie's inscrutable "boy" Ali, and of course, the widowed nineteen-year-old Helen Rolt, the obscure object of Scobie's love/pity. He creates indelible images with extraordinary economy: "His hilarity was like a scream from a crevasse," or "her face went out like a candle in a sudden draught of wind." Published in 1948, THE HEART OF THE MATTER remains thought provoking and relevant to this day and belongs on the "must read" list of all serious readers.  
 I'm so happy because my kitty loves tunnel!! He plays hours and hours with my family and me...it's very exciting...when he hears that someone is near, he enters in tunnel, runs and Attacks by surprise :D!! Really fun!! I recommend this product 100 
 This shortish book is composed of the transcripts of Forster's 1927 series of talks about the novel, and is divided into chapters on story, characters, plot, and pattern & rhythm.  In my opinion the two chapters on fantasy and prophecy are less successful, but if you are considering this book then you should definitely read it.  It's filled with wonderful lines and terrific criticism (both positive and negative) of contemporary novels by Austen, Wells, Scott, Dostoevsky, Proust, James and others, and it was this latter aspect that I found most enjoyable.  There is also an index so you can find these references when you want to.  Forster discusses the sense of time and space in literature, round and flat characters, food, sex, love, POV, story vs. plot and causality.  I've been reading novels for several decades and have read a fair number of books about writing, and I still gained insight from this lively little book.  
 the boy who spoke dog was a very adventurist book. and it is a story of partnership and friend ship i could not stop reading it!!!! i highly recomend that you read this book 
 You may get some funny looks as you stick your head into this book to look through the 3-D glasses, but it is well worth it!    There are some remarkable photos; my favorites include the Marine Iguana, the Galapagos shark, and the Stone Scorpionfish (which looks like something from Star Wars).   Mark Blum specializes in underwater stereo photography, and some of the underwater photos such as the seahare or spotted moray eel really pop out.   There are also the Galapagos favorites such as Sally Light-Foot Crabs and Sea Lions.  Only a few of the pictures did not work that well in 3-D, such as the brown pelican, or some of the habitat photos, but provided for well-rounded text.    Associated with each of the 44 pictures is a useful paragraph that introduces the species or habitat.  For example, I did not know that the sex of the Giant Tortoise offspring depended upon the temperature of the nest.   A fun book for any age 
 Bill Bryson is a genius. This book is absolutely hilarious. I was never much of a reader, but i got this book for a present and when i started reading it i couldnt put it down. This is a must read. Bill Bryson, please right more (italy, islands, etc.)!! 
 Do you guys have any idea when will season 2,3,4,5 come out? This is the best show i have ever seen! Even though this show is beyond my time, its great to look back at sf back in the day. This dvd collection was worth my money! I can't wait till all the season is out on dvd 
 When most people think of country music, they tend to think of Tennessee and Texas but California has a strong country music tradition of its own exemplified by the success of Buck Owens. He had a lot of success with his own record, while his songs provided hits for others and he was also an inspiration for other Californians including Merle Haggard and Dwight Yoakam. This compilation contains three CD's of Buck's finest music.  The box includes all of Buck's classics including Above and beyond (later successfully revived by Rodney Crowell), Act naturally (which was covered by the Beatles), Love's gonna live here, Together again, I've got a tiger by the tail and many others. Buck also wrote Crying time but released it on a B-side. Ray Charles covered it and had a huge pop hit with it. You can find Buck's version here. Buck originally recorded Streets of Bakersfield in 1974 but the song only became successful when Dwight Yoakam decided to cover it as a duet with Buck. Both versions are included here.  Apart from Dwight, this features other notable guests including Susan Raye (Buck's duet partner in the early seventies), Rose Maddox (on Loose talk and Mental cruelty), Emmylou Harris (singing Play Together again again) and Ringo Starr (on a re-recording of Act Naturally).  While Buck wrote many of his own songs, he also had big country hits with cover versions. Here, you will find his superb versions of Save the last dance for me, Johnny B Goode, Bridge over troubled water and Roll in my sweet baby's arms.  A close look at the Billboard country charts will show that one or two big hits are missing, but that doesn't really matter. Real country music fans will find much to get excited about here 
 This is an extremely well reseached, well thought through, and well written book.  Unfortunately it does not convey very good news for those of us who wish a better furture for our children, grandchildren, and possibly our great grandchildren.  In case you aren't familar with the word, "hubris" means excessive arrogance due to pride.  The book makes an irrefutable case for the old axiom, "pride goeth before the fall." The book was published in 2004 and as of today 03/20/2006 it's predictions are spot on.  Read the book and you'll understand why so many Americans are being killed (I'm projecting a little into the future).  I certainly hope you and I aren't among those U.S. citizens who will "pay the piper" for trusting leaders unworthy of trust; then again doing nothing about it when we discover what they did makes us accessory and therefore guilty.  Those reading this review or the book in the years after 2008 will be totally astounded at the author's perceptive and predicting abilities.  Having a bit of knowledge relating to world history and Islam will help the reader of this excellent work 
  Despite its slightly lackluster plot and rather excessive length, Anna Karenina remains one of my favorite books of all time.There seems to be no thought pattern, no emotional subtlety, no tumultuous inner conflict - in short, no condition of being human, however complex - that Tolstoy cannot perfectly elucidate in description and metaphor. It is these magnificent insights into the human experience, presented with a clarity that will take your breath away, which for me made this book well worth reading.  On the whole, I highly recommend this book. It is one of those few books that don't allow you to remain indifferent. You might hate it or love it, but it will necessarily make you think about several important subjects, while reading a good story. If you did like it, and want to read more of Russina classic literature, my other recommendation goes to "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsk 
 This book has been described as Kissinger-light by some people I know.  What that means is it doesn't get bogged down on every detail.  Instead, it is a very readable book that people with only a modicum of international knowledge can still enjoy.  It basically is a summary of U.S. foreign policy since it was forged as a nation.    Kissinger outlines each region of the world and then analyzes them with a uniquely discerning mind.  The thrust of this book is how America went from its cold-war strategy in world affairs up until the summer before 9/11.  Kissinger analyzes Clinton's attempts to develop a new policy and then shows how Clinton fumbled and floundered in every attempt outside our shores.  The best thing about this book and the reason it will be a classic for history students is its timing.  The book ends just before 9/11 happened.  I can not think of a better person than the foremost expert in world affairs to write a compendium just prior to such a watershed mark in world history.    This book will serve as the best tool of knowing just what was going on in the world and where things were heading prior to that fateful day that changed everyone's idea of what was happening in the world.  With the exception of a few fanatics that think they are still living in the sixties, Everyone knows that Kissinger is a brilliant man that is not easily matched on the world level.  Kissinger's ability as Secretary of State was unprecedented in the 20th century and will not easily be surpassed in the 21st.  His ability to analyze the minutia of details and events throughout the globe is awesome.  The fact is when Kissinger speaks everyone with an interest in foreign affairs takes it serious and does not balk at what he has to say.  There is no one else on the scene today that commands that kind of respect. 
 After reading the book I concluded I have zero hope of building one and I need to contact the author to build it for me.  Brilliant brouchure for his company.  I would take off stars for the flagrant selling but you know what it is  just that good a book on the subject and the fact is its hard work and he is good at it.  Hell just buy the book and have them build it 
 Very well written.  Interesting.  Kind of depressing but knew it would be due to subject matter 
 I have a very demanding job and this book helps make my life easier with the great and easy recipes. 
 Reading THE CURTAIN is akin to what I would imagine it would be like to hear Kundera lecture to a small group about literature.  The tone is really quite intimate.  His prose incredibly lucid (as always) and his ideas are so clear.   
 If you want to read a great book then read Silver Packages because it will just touch your heart. It all started when no one had anything so every Christmas a man came and threw silver packages out the back of the train.  Chris Soentpiet's illustrations are colorful and interesting 
 The Story:   "The Point" is a great animated film.  I grew up watching "The Point" because my parents taped the movie from TV sometime when it aired.  A round-headed boy grows up to the age of ten and is then exiled from his hometown of pointed-headed people because he looks different from them.  He and his dog wander through a forest and come upon different characters living there, each with a lesson of some kind to impart on the boy.  I won't give away the ending, but you will smile.    The Music: Throughout the story, songs from Harry Nilsson are played and, like an animated music video, you get lost in the songs.  The songs do not have much to do with the story as it progresses, but they are not childen's songs.  Rather, Harry Nilsson's songs are warm and easy to sing for adult and child.  As a child, I sang them all the time.     The Animation: The animation and character design are really interesting.  No anime or CGI here.  It looks to be hand-painted and definitely a product of great imagination.     Recommendation: "The Point" is a great film and songbook that you can use teach your children about the problems and unfairness of race and discrimination without images of violence.  I also recommend "The Point" to any fan of Harry Nilsson or Ringo Star (who narrates the film) 
 This is a good book if you want a detailed history of how copyright law evolved to accomodate digital technology and the Internet.  That is the focus of Litman's work.  Her writing is engaging and straightforward, and she has good reasons for being pessimistic and disappointed with the current Copyright Act 
 Jacob Needleman has written an unbelievable book. I didn't think anything can surpass The Power Of Now, but this has. He writes in simple prose while contributing a fairy tale story as the  metaphorical dialog. There are many times when I had to put the book down and absorb what I had just read. I get chills. He explains and simplifies what I have always felt and now can reveal and let go of. A fascinating book that should be a constant companion .      
 You gotta to own this Eurythmics album Peace the reunion album that they released in 1999. It is a very good album that Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart made in their last one in 1989 that was We Too Are One. The songs are very song with Annie's voice that tunes up so high and Dave's guitar background that sounds so good. 17 Again is a execellent song on that album that is good for reunions and also the others one are good like I Saved The World Today, Peace Is Just A Word, I Want It All and more. We hope that they could get back together again with a brand new album for the future and that will be another Eurythmics reunion for the future 
 Wislawa Szymborska writes with the wit and freshness of the American beat poets, layered with the sence of history and emotional depth that can only come from living through the last seventy years of turmoil in Europe.  She has a very musical style. She begins by building descriptive lines, then rises to a staccato rediscovery of her subject, then resloving each poem with a kind of rational passion that is rare in even the most accomplished poets. 	This book has the added advantage of being the only one of her books that has been translated by people who not only know both tongues, but who understand language, meter, lyric and nuance.  More poems are offered in  View with a Grain of Sand, but not with the level of quality of translation. 	Highly recommened for those who do not want sentimentality, endless rhyming and dull subject matter.  Szymborska is deserving off all of the attention she is finally receiving, and more 
 I am an advid martial arts fanatic.  I have purchased some dummies and some classics.  But this movies stands above any of the ones that I have just purchased.  I have waited for a long time and with the right price, I got just what the Doctor ordered.  This movie, in all its integrity, has what it takes to become an all-time classic.  The fight scenes and styles and characters will astound you.  THIS IS A MUST FOR ANYONE TO HAVE AND A CONSTANT JOY TO WATCH.  I HAVE NOT STOPPED WATCHING THIS MOVIE FOR AT LEAST 12 HOURS.  For anyone who knows good KUNG-FU and can relish the quality of good photography, will indeed love it.  The quality of the movie in my opinion, rated AAAAA+. Also, get Hell's Windstaff w/ Hwang Jang Lee a.k.a. "The Silver Fox" Another great movie. Hurry! Hurry! 
 This book was wonderful to read. I felt so relieve that there was even a book out there on this subject. Yes, it is a little out dated with some of the view's from women but it was right on as far as how to help overcome the inability to orgasm. I was fortunate enough to read this book with my partner, but I know that you don't need to have a partner to benefit from this book. It helps you and how you feel during sex 
 I looked all over for the Limone Biscotti after receiving a few at Christmas.  Unfortunately you can only get them in a combination package or in limited quantities.  So this opportunity to purchase a case was perfect.  My entire office enjoys having these biscotti with their morning tea or coffee.  You can't beat Nonni's 
 i recently picked this book up at Mega fest.... i actally met the author and got it signed not knowing what to expcetd i started to read it on the plane ride home and it def change my mindset about my currently relationship i def recommend this book to EVERY WOMAN it will help u to understnad what u were blind too... im ending my relationship because God used this book to speak to me... i plan on reading it again and again until i can get the concepts down in my mind... praise the Lord for the way he uses other people when we are so blind to what we are doing ... enjoy this!!!! 
 To write a long trilogy on the very last months of the DDR from the point of view of the British Secret Services in 1994 is « nearly » anachronic. So the author chose a completely different approach than a simple spy story. It is a real novel with real and thick characters who do have a social existence and a cultural density. The « action » is slower of course. And the object of the novel is not to show us one more of those unbeatable James Bond. The object of the novel is to explore the human and unhuman, definitely unhumane, functioning of London Central. Incredible conflicts between field-agents and bureaucrats, the severe hierarchization of these bureaucrats in the number of square meters of office space they get, with or without a window, with carpet or linoleum on the floor, etc. This constant inside strife is the main characteristic of London Central. The plot of the book will peter out because field agents have no say, and bureaucrats forget essential elements. The bureaucrats dream theories that bite the dust when implemented, at times with casualties, and yet they will survive with essentially two methods. 1- They will put the blame on their underlings (and there is condescendence in this attitude) ; 2- They will cover up the failure with a false explanation that will make a KGB or Stasi agent become a sniper in London and use an American weapon and all the night equipment necessary. They will of course try to cover up the nature of the weapon. For that reason the book is interesting. We are under the surveillance and control - constant control - of secret services who are the most conflictual pot of spiders in the world. We don't know them. We have to trust them. And we may find ourselves under crossfire. Bad luck and that has not changed since the end of the Cold War, far from it. The advantage of this system was that it more or less shortcircuited terrorism. Nowadays we still have the conflictual antagonistic secret services plus the various terrorist organizations that provide some discontents with the possibility to express their anger at, or their ambition in, their society and world that are the cause of their discontentment.

 My boyfriend is a Big Lebowski fanatic, so his son and I bought this for him one Father's Day, and he loves it. The only issue I had with the shirt is that we got an extra-large size and it still fit a little tightly (he's not a huge man). I also think I remember noticing that the graphic was a little crooked, which was not very noticible unless you looked more closely. He still appreciated this gift, though 
 I borrowed this book from a friend. She was very much into history and I din't think I would like it. It is a good sized book and I happened to be looking for something to keep me busy at this time in my life.From the first page on, I couldn't put it down. Its a book that will pull you in  from page one.I wish now I could own this book and also visit Union Maine.  If you read it, it will stay with you for a very long time 
 I read this book to my daughter EVERY night for months. Now she's two and has a bigger library to choose from, but it remains a bedtime favorite. She loves seeing the little girl at the end of the book and likes to say "night-night" to all of the animals as we read along 
 French Cooking in Ten Minutes: Or Adapting to the Rhythm of Modern Life by Edouard De Pimiane will give cooks basic information about preparing a meal in a short amount of time.  Written in 1930, the quick and easy recipes can be just the thing for a change of pace in the kitchen.    Translated from the French, this little cookbook gives us a view of life 58 years ago when things moved at a fast pace and people had little time for cooking after a long day at the office. Sounds like today!  De Pomiane's recipes utilize pre-packaged and canned foods, fresh fruit, and step by step instructions.  De Pomiane, a doctor by profession, makes even the trickest of sauces appear easy to make.  All in all, not a bad addition to the kitchen bookshelf. 
 Though not quite as good as the band's first album, "No. 10 Upping Street" still contains enough good songs to make it worthwhile.  The best are "C'mon Every Beatbox," "Limbo the Law," "Sambadrome," and the drum machine solo "V. Thirteen."  The signature B.A.D. sound of heavy sampling over a reggae, rap and synth-dance beats is ever present.  It's a bracing mixture for those used to the type of material leader Mick Jones used to produce with his former mates in The Clash.  But in its own way, it is every bit as challenging 
 This book has changed my life.  I now realize that my "inner brat" has been in control of the way I react and think for most of my adult life instead of me. I have struggled with initimate relationships, because of this behavior. The information provided by Paulin Wallin is very useful and it can put you in control of the way you think and react to emotional triggers instead of your inner brat. Anyone who exibits self destructive behavior will want to read this book 
 Let me preface this by saying that I loved "Neverwhere."  This book of short fictions was incredible. My personal favorites - the little story in the introduction and Nicholas - great reading for the engaged and before Christmas.  Who can forget Murder Mysteries?  What a fantastic collection of stories for anyone who enjoys Gaiman OR SF 
 the whole movie can be summed up in two words klaus kinski!! his take on the "nosferatu"(vampire) is one so removed from most vampire movies that it really is strikeing in its tone. our vampire is one who has been one for so long that most,if not all,of the human qualities he had are long gone and he is little more than an animal(like the rats he keeps,and looks very much like). he never lets you take your eyes off him once you meet him!! he looks alone and lost in the castle when we see him and the only time we see any life(pun intended) is when he see's harker's wife's picture and in the last scene he has with her! if you get into it this tale will keep you glued to the set long after it ends! a very good film and the transfer is great 
 I gave this book to my 34 year old son for Christmas, and he loved it!  He did have fond memories of the TV movie, so that made it a little nostalgic, which is always nice at Christmas.  He thought the book version was just as good if not better--very funny and sweet, loads of fun to read, and the message of the story was very meaningful to him.  Didn't we all have special childhood experiences that continue to hold some mystery and magic for us, and that we enjoy re-visiting when we're reminded of it? The feeling of deja and nostalgia about our youthful years is kind of hard to describe, but it's very special. I highly recommend it for yourself or for a gift 
 I love teaching but was seriously wondering if I was cut out for it until I read this book. The classroom management problems were overpowering. Reading this book has changed me into the type of teacher that I wanted to be, and knew I could be. The time that I spent managing the classroom is now spent teaching. There are so few books out there that truly address the problems that we deal with at the secondary level, and these methods work! However, my only criticism with the book is that it assumes that we are going to get at least some parental support, and does not address the problems of lack of support, or worse yet, when the parents are the problem. Also, I wish he would make two separate books, one for elementary and one for secondary. 
 Looked at a number of cameras including the TZ3, P5000, and a few others.  Nothing compared to the G7 which is the one I ended up going with; IS, 6x lens, incredible quality, etc.  If you want the best camera out there and don't feel like messing with a DSLR, the Canon G7 is in a league of it's own ~ The Benchmark by which all other manufacturers strive towards. 
 I never understood why some critics call this album "patchy" or "flawed". For me, it is perfect from start to finish. LITTLE GIRL BLUE and KOSMIC BLUES are among the most intense and beautiful recordings EVER made. This is the best album JANIS ever released, no doubt about it 
 This book is so helpful.  Having a sister and a friend who have experienced this tremendous loss, I feel thankful that this book was written.  It not only helps the family but friends also.  The best part is  that it is a small book so, when you can not think anyway after this kind  of loss, it is easy to stay with it. Thank you Marilyn, who also has  responded through Compassionate friends to us 
 The title is misleading: Abs, Buns and Thighs remind me of a strength training workout however this DVD is all-cardio with very minimal strength training. It's a fun and intense (intermediate-level) workout! You get three 20-minute segments: 1 circuit training, 1 more-low impact and 1 more-high impact workouts. I got a good sweat after I did all three segments and I consider myself a high intermediate/low advanced exerciser. I didn't have a hard time following the moves and I disagree with Tina who said that the focus of the camera is more on headshots and the upper body. I have done this workout a couple of times already and the focus of the camera is on the total body with some upper and lower body focus. I also disagree with Tina when she said the kickboxing is easy. Fact is, there is no kickboxing segment in this DVD. People should note that these workouts were taken from Fit TV so there are naturally "gaps" or "breaks" where they put in the commercials. However, for the DVD, you don't get the commercials so that's why people think there are "interruptions" in filming. I was able to follow the moves right after the "breaks" so I didn't have a problem at all. All in all, a great purchase at a bargain price 
 There are several reasons why I dig Sarah Vowell and this book, Assassination Vacation.  For one, Vowell is an unapologetic history geek.  She is willing to go the extra mile to see the place where an assassin experimented with hippie style free love in the 1800's.  She's willing, no enchanted, with the idea of visiting some obscure site where Robert Todd Lincoln once fell on the railroad tracks.  She goes the extra mile so we don't have to, see?    But for me, that's just it.  I do want to go that extra mile.  I am also a history geek, and Vowell's book brings out the Nerd Nerdy McNerdington in me, wanting to visit all of these out of the way, unheard of trivial places just like she does.    Secondly, she does a really good job of telling a story, as I believe all good teachers must do, and she does it in a witty, eloquent, sometimes verbose, definitely tangential way that I find endearing.  Most history students in the world would rather do anything else than read about some 1800's dead people, but Vowell has the talent to make those stories come to life.  Finally, there's the history she reveals, most of which the average Joe would never have known.  I won't include the spoilers here, but I have taught for 15 years, have a college degree in history, and was unaware of many of the details of Presidential and assassination history to be found in her book.  Toss in a somewhat macabre sense of humor and a striking resemblance to Wednesday Addams of Addams Family fame, and you have the makings of an entertaining weekend 
 When I had my first glass of absinthe maybe two years ago, I ordered this gorgeous book. It's a time travel showing the history of absinthe through the life of artists who drank it. To my knowledge, it's the best english language book on the subject. Fully illustrated. Unfortunately it's a paper back 
 Thirty-six years old Paula Halstead met Rockwell on the bus because both of them were holding brochures to the opening of the San Francisco Spring Opera.  At the Greyhound Station, she waits for her spouse Curt to arrive while Rockwell walks towards a car.  A gang of four drunken teens on a lark viciously attack the blond.  Paula pleads with them to stop, but they don't until Curt arrives.  They flee the scene, but leave behind a blinded victim; Paula pukes up her guts at the horrific sight.  Rick Dean realizes Paula could identify him and his associates.  They learn she is the wife of Los Feliz University anthropology Professor Curtis Halstead.  The quartet plan to insure she says nothing so they obtain her home address and pay a visit.  They viciously beat her, threaten her, and rape her.  When they leave, unable to cope she slashes her wrists.  The cops fail him so Curt knows he must find, torture, and execute the four punks who destroyed his life.  He hires a PI who meets with no success either.  Curt concludes he must descend to the underbelly of society to confront the killers on their terms, which he obsessively is determined to do.  This is a reprint of an award winning 1969 tale that holds up quite nicely though feels like a historical.  The story line is character driven whether it is Rick, Curt or Paula, but within an action-packed dark plot.  The then rookie Joe Gores showcased a pessimistic San Franciscan society with his no SF elements version of Clockwork Orange meets Hammett.  Harriet Klausner 
 This book gives access to all the senses.  I pick it up and read sections at all different times of the day and always come upon something new and intriguing.   I love the description of kissing, drinking someone in.  Reminiscent of Don Juan DeMarco, one of my favorites... There is always a new way of sensing the world through Diane Ackerman's very alive sensuality

 Again, Kurt Vonnegut produces an excellent work of art through literature. This book, Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons (Opinions) is a collection of essays written by Vonnegut. It took me only a few hours to begin and finish this book while drinking coffee in front of a coffee shop on a Saturday morning. I found the book to be highly entertaining, generously humorous, and, of course, packed with blithe satire.  Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons (Opinions) exists in an aura of surreality, recounting the experiences had by Vonnegut. The preface, itself, explains that the novel contains situations related to ideas that are not only abnormal but not tangible, either. The word wampeter comes from Vonnegut's book, Cat's Cradle (see my review of Cat's Cradle at http://preview.epinions.com/book-review-5DE0-39E4406-397F4030-prod6 ), and it describes any "object around which the lives of many otherwise unrelated people may revolve". This definition, alone, prompts the reader to realize that the book will involve many exemplifications of abstract ideology.  The novel contains essays describing events and satiring politics and societal figures. Vonnegut is one of the world's greatest black-humorists, and it is expected that he will try to offend quite a few persons while writing his works. Thus, Vonnegut's writing may not be for the light-hearted, and if this means you, then maybe you should not rush out to the bookstore and buy this book. However, if you dare to delve into the depths of derogatory literature, then this should be your next book. Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Vonnegut, but very much on my mind since I purchased it off Amazon is "The Losers' Club" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about. 
 This is my absolute favorite cookbook.  All of the recipes are fairly simple and have easy to follow instructions.   I also love the section in the back with healthier recipes.  I haven't made anything in this cookbook that wasn't delicious 
 I thought this book was going to be a mystery, and it borders on being one, however as someone else pointed out it crosses genres and was much more.  The story is very engaging, and the plot moves quickly, much as a thriller does. But this is no thriller.  It is witty and funny in places -- I laughed out loud several times while reading it.  It is intelligent, which is a refreshing change from so many authors today.  Plus the characters are well-developed so you start caring about them.  And it has a sense of place.  I can think of very few "mysteries" I would say all that about.  It most reminds me of my favorite mystery writer, Donna Leon, and that says quite a lot.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story (which others have outlined and I will not repeat) and hated when it ended.  I recommend it highly 
 This is one of the most profound parts in this book that is factually true:  "Wallace's reasons for wanting to introduce the Great Seal onto the American currency were based on his belief that America was reaching a turning point in her history and that great spiritual changes were imminent. He believed that the 1930s represented a time when a great spiritual awakening was going to take place which would precede the creation of the one-world state."   - Michael Howard, The Occult Conspiracy, p.95   To the person who says it was riddled with errors but yet admits he does not know a lot about secret societies and the occult should take this book more seriously. It takes a lot of courage and risk to write about this often misunderstood and untalked about subject that goes on every day. The people who are victims need to be redeemed and a book like this can do it. It is sad that the people in real power do not care about the general public but only about their own agendas, feelings and ambitions. This is why we have wars and deceptions. Really to those who truly understand the inner workings of the people in power should not be surprised about any of this. There is so much more than this book covers but I give Mr. Howard great support in what he does. Very few people even in church either believe or want to deal with what goes on underneath the veil of the surface of what is revealed to the world. 
 The exhibition was absolutely wonderful with material from Louvre,British Museum,National Museum of Iran,my eyes were filled with tears as soon I walked into the exhibition rooms and I remembered  my first visit to Persepolis(Parse) as a child.Cyrus the Great laid the foundation for an Empire based on tolerance for other cultures and traditions and the Great king and Persians demonstrated their desire for other nations to maintain their own ethnocultural traditions.I recommend this book specially to readers who wish to get the correct information contray to the repeated Macedonian propaganda and I hope this book will be available in Persian language for that group of my compatriot who have forgotten their glorious past.The name of the book describes my point of view 
 "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" is one of those rare films that bridges the child-adult film gap.  Persons of all ages can watch, eyes wide, and revel in Willy Wonka's eccentricities and Charlie's inate goodness and splendid luck.  The film, more than 30 years old, hardly feels its age.  Made in a time before computerized special effects, the relative cheese quotient only serves to make the film that much more charming. Gene Wilder is superbly cast as the unconvential confectioner, Willy Wonka, who is partial to brightly colored leisure suits, large hats and not averse to breaking into song when the moment requires it.  Rather than being simply odd and borderline unsettling as Johnny Depp would portray him three decades later, Wilder's Wonka is obviously an overgrown kid himself, a person who truly enjoys making candy and making people smile.  There is not a hint of any darkness hiding behind those dancing eyes.   The children are all marvelously cast, each one befitting their character's physical description on Roald Dante's classic book.  Despite hating seeing them go, their individual come-uppances are rewarding and indulging.  The parents have very little to do, other than watch their respective children get into trouble, bemoan the fact and watch the Mystic-Tanned Oompa Loompas break into early karaoke about it.   Watching this movie reminds me of what is so fun about being a child - - the innocence involved in believing that such a place as the Wonka Factory can exist, and the good kid (Charlie) comes out on top in the end, while the bad kids go home empty-handed and having learned their lesson.   "Willy Wonka" is good, clean fun for the whole family, with catchy lyrics provided by the Oompa Loompas to boot.  Pop it in, break out some chocolate bars or gobstoppers and enjoy 
 This book easily complements my Win2K manuals. Most notable chapters are 28-29, i.e. Penetration Testing: Hack Your Own System and Writing Secure Code. Highly recommended for anyone trying to secure their Win2K environment. Pity it's not available in PDF 
 While I wholly appreciated this book for the story in of its self, I was not a fan of how far away it strayed from the story of Mr Darcy and Miss Bennett.  This really could have been completely taken out of the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman series all together.  It was more of a historical mystery novel than an addition to the story of Pride & Prejudice in my opinion.  Marketing it as such would have been a better idea.  The story itself was good, just not to the inclusion of an addition to Jane Austen's original work 
 I LOVE these cups and better yet so does my baby!  They are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink.  She has no idea that it's not a bottle.  It has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier.  Thank you 
 Arnie Cunningham is a high school geek. He has glasses, pimples, controlling parents, and no girls until he meets up with Christine.  Christine is a 1958 Plymouth Sport Fury that Arnie finds, and is immediately attracted to her. Christine gets fixed up by Arnie and Arnie gets some attention.(his first girlfriend).  As Christine starts putting her spell on Arnie, he loses touch with the things that matter most like family, school and his friends. Arnie gets deeply entranced by Christine and uses her as a tool to get back at people her were not so nice to him.  Arnie and Christine turn into a Thelma and Louise and go on a killing spree. Arnie, in turn, loses everything, his friends, Christine, and his life.  My Thoughts:  Christine is one of my favorite reads. I love the storyline, because it is mostly believable. This young nerd gets a cool car and everybody starts liking him. This is believable! Then he gets a big head and people start disliking him!(also believable) When Arnie falls under Christines spell, it is most exciting to me. I relate to Arnie in the aspect of time and love he put into Christine, something that every car lover does. When Christine turns into a killer and fixes herself,the story gets supernatural. I like how Christine is displayed with feelings of jealousy, which gives this car a personable image.  Overall, I feel this book is a great read for anyone with a desire for an ultimate twist 
 Near the end of Francesca Lia Block's brilliant new novel, PSYCHE IN A DRESS, the title character reflects on her life, thinking, "When your mothers tell you to love and appreciate your body it isn't just to get you to shut up. They know that when you are old you are going to feel exactly the same way inside that you do now. We try on different dresses, different selves, but our souls are always the same --- ongoing, full of light."  In this lyrical, complex novel, trying on different selves, different dresses, different names is exactly what happens to Psyche (Soul). Born to a largely absent mother and a tyrannical, sadistic film director father, Psyche feels at odds with her surroundings. She only feels complete when she unites with her mysterious lover, Eros (Love), who comes to her in darkness, with the smell of "night-blooming flowers" and the scent of the ocean. Eros holds her and tells her stories of the myths. Their relationship seems idyllic until Psyche, goaded by her sisters, betrays Eros's trust by using a candle to see his face.  Eros, crushed by her doubting, flees from Psyche, who is destined to spend the rest of her life trying to recapture the love she once knew. As she does so, she is transformed, in body and name, into various heroines of the Greek myths Eros once told her: Echo, Eurydice (whose Orpheus sounds a lot like Kurt Cobain) and Persephone (whose Hades also bears a passing resemblance to Marilyn Manson). During her odyssey, Psyche travels to hell and back, and through a variety of landscapes, from lush gardens to wealthy boutiques, that firmly place her story in a thoroughly modern California setting.  Finally, when Soul and Love unite, a daughter, Joy, is born, and the true nature of the mythic patterns that have shaped Psyche's life is revealed. Fans of Block's earlier books, including the vastly popular Weetzie Bat series, know that Block often infuses her lyrical writing with mythical and fantastic elements. Here, though, she goes a step further, using the classic myths as the basis for an undeniably modern story. Drug use, rape, abuse and a variety of other evils reveal the true brutality of the myths, while Block's flowing free verse reveals their beauty.     --- Reviewed by Norah Pieh 
 Excellent is not the word for such quick attention!  I ordered the book on Friday and got it on my in try on Monday morning - inspite being an international order 
 It's important to mention, that this physically small dictionary has its limitations. The dictionary doesn't cover every aspect on rhyming. But it's not its generally purpose. The book will come in handy for those who want a fast rhyme (or half rhyme) to finish his/her lyrics in a good way. It also have some practical information on songwriting in general. I like this practical book for what it is. Even though it's small, its potential are huge 
 I dont care if you are 11-40 its a great book for every one it made me cry and laugh it is a great story to help you to understand people with problems. It is my favorite book and you will love it to 
 this book provides clear, concrete examples of five "traditions" or types of qualitative research.  If you need to understand the differences between biography, ethnography, grounded theory, case study, and other qualitative methods, this is the book for you.

 I first read Ebenezer Le Page several years ago when it was given to me by a friend in Arizona. Being English it wasn't too much of a stretch to picture the Guernsey that Ebenezer new and loved. Of all the books I have ever read in my life this is absolutely the one I would choose to take to a desert island. I've recommended it and passed it on to family and friends as a must read.  GB Edwards was a master story teller and it's fortunate that the manuscript for this beautiful novel was not destroyed after his death, which was his wish. As I reached the last few chapters of the book I felt a little depressed that it was all going to end. However, the ending is so perfect that it makes this book a treasure that you will want to keep and read again 
 Wonderful end of the trilogy. Did not disappoint. I'm just sad to be finished with the series. Look forward to the next. Definitely recommend. As usual very gripping storyline, hard to put down. 
 One of Leone's most memorable flicks,Clint Eastwood reprises his role for the third time as the man with no name,or Blondie,in this flick.In this installment,a kind of Rat Race-type situation occurs where a lone ranger,a robber,and a baddie get involved in a plot to get $50,000 first.There begind a perilous journey of betrayal,murder,and revenge.I especially like the character Tuco,with his quick,fast wit and hillarious habits,it's hard not to laugh.Lee Van Clef is also brilliant as angel Eyes,the baddie in the flick who tries to take out Blondie and Tuco.It's a roller coaster ride to the end

 At 77 minutes this film really packs a wallop---hilarious most of the way through, but also poignant and incisive at turns.    I rented this film mainly because I absolutely love both Sigourney Weaver and Bebe Neuwirth but I had low expectations, thinking it was probably going to be another "The Graduate" knockoff with the sort of pretentious deadness of "Rushmore."    Instead I was pleasantly surprised: while "Tadpole" does make a couple of self-conscious and coy allusions to "The Graduate" (one of my all-time favorites that I've seen dozens of times) it definitely has its own unique style and flavor.  Aaron Stanford is no Dustin Hoffman but is more than up to the role, portraying the super-bright, gawky teenager very adroitly.  Weaver and Neuwirth put in excellent performances as is their norm, Neuwirth especially packs an ungodly amount of devastating sexual magnetism in every scene, with every glance and gesture and word---ay yi yi, I kept wanting to kick Stanford for not being elated to have HER fall into his lap!    The other really side-splitting supplier of comic relief here is John Ritter, who plays the brainy but clueless college professor with delightful aplomb...I didn't even realize he was John Ritter until the credits!   All in all this is a light film but utterly delightful, it's too bad it's not at least an extra 30 minutes longer.   Some reviewers have complained about the digital camera picture often being washed out but I found it perfectly fine, my only objection was a bit of excessive camera movement during the first 15 minutes of the movie.  Otherwise everything comes together marvelously: the strong script and cast, score, camera work, film editing, etc.  For the 2 weeks of filming and shoestring $150,000 budget they really put together a very high quality piece of work.  How refreshing to see a film that dares to do whatever the hell it wants however it wants, without boring the audience to tears 
 Santa brought James, Percy and Toby for Christmas to match the Thomas set that my 3 year old got for his birthday.  Santa actually had to hunt for Toby on E-bay as it was sold out everywhere!  We are very happy with all 4 of them.  
 This book is no way near as good as the first.  It is mostly the same material told in a less engaging way.  He uses the metaphor of Wall Street as Roulette Game in a Casino which cheats it's clients.  If you like Darvas's first book it is certainly worth reading to gain little insights on his method which youdon't get in the first.  There a few new anecdotes and a chapter which explains his method but on the whole the book is not as amusing a read and lacks the freshness of the first, nor do I think it takes his story much farther than where the last ends.  I would love to know what happened to Darvas in the late sixties and early seventies but not in this book 
 By the Shores of Silver Lake, by Laura Ingalls Wilder  The family had not fared will in Plum Creek. The plague of locusts destroyed their crops one year, and left debts and poor crops afterward. Game for meat was scarce. Aunt Docia visited with a job offer for Pa, but he must leave for a railroad camp in Dakota Territory. A homesteader could get 160 acres there, and hunting is better. Aunt Docia tells the family news from Wisconsin. Another chapter begins for the Ingalls family. Scarlet fever had struck the family, and Mary went blind. Good old faithful Jack expired. Pa left in the covered wagon, and Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace would follow by train. Laura tells Mary about their trains, its windows, and what can be seen. When they stop for dinner Laura is amazed by the railroad turntable. Pa spoke of the wonderful times they were living in. [The Age of Victoria saw many innovations that changed the world.] Pa came in the wagon to take them to their new home.  Uncle Hi worked hard on the railroad all summer. But the company figured he owed them money (Chapter 5)! They are deeper in debt. Laura gets to ride one of the ponies. [Laura's description of the sights to Mary has trained her for journalism.] There was an enormous stillness on this prairie (p.60). They are surprised to find Uncle Henry and his family from the Big Woods of Wisconsin. Pa tells his family about the gambling and horse thieves in the railroad camp. One wonderful afternoon Laura goes with Pa to see them build the railroad. Men with plows break the prairie sod. Scrapers leveled the plowed strip. Low ground is filled in, high ground is cut through to make the grade level. This uses less fuel for the engines. Pa explained how the surveyors measured it all and marked the route.   The paymaster delivers the cash to Pa, who will distribute the money due to each worker. Pa now carries a revolver for protection against robbers. Some of the men don't like being paid for only the first two weeks (Chapter 11). There is trouble at another work camp. But work ends for the winter, and everyone leaves. Pa gets the caretaker's job so the family can stay at Silver Lake and live in the Surveyor's House. It is so quiet there you can hear a wolf howl nearby. Visitors come for Christmas, and they feast (Chapter 21). The Reverend Alden also shows up; he will start his church. The warm March weather brings many men who come to settle and claim homesteads. Pa is able to file his claim on the land he wants. But the many people who settle there change the environment. The animals and birds stay away and Pa can't hunt.  There are signs of Laura's maturity. We read about thefts, robbery, and murder. The girls must lock their attic bedroom door when strange men are staying over (room and board), and are not allowed outside by dusk. Pa has a scuffle when registering his claim. When moving to their homestead they see a light wagon drawn by the finest horses in the county; those are the Wilder boys. They move into the little claim shanty. Laura helps Pa put tar paper on the shanty. Settlers must plant ten acres of trees on every section; they break the wind, shade in summer, and provide fuel for winter (p.220). Pa plants cottonwood trees grown from seeds around the shanty. Living near the Big Slough brought mosquitoes at dusk. The wetness that provided plentiful hay had a trade-off. And so the Ingalls settle where lately the buffalo roamed. 
 This book has told me that history can be fun. and i think Rosemary Sutcliff has a art for history, and i think everyone should read it 
 Let's just start by stating its a "Best of..." because (believe it or not) not enough people have bought his singles for him to make actual "Greatest Hits".  If your in this category, buy it, your in for a treat.  For those that already have everything he's ever done, I'll concentrate on this disc's value added, like how each song has a (real) short paragraph penned by Hiatt revealing the history/state of mind when it was written.  And the new/reworked/first time released songs, like...  "Have a Little Faith in Me" - Reworked like a single (as opposed to the stark/emotional original) complete with female backup, gospel choir, and set to a persistent 90's style clap track beat.  Its only missing the guest Rapper.  "The Way We Make A Broken Heart" - Left off of the "Riding with the King" album, this song features a duet w/Rosanne Cash (who sounds a little like Crystal Gayle in "One From the Heart").  Maybe not better than some songs that got bumped off this disc to make room for it, but it's nice to hear an almost lost/rare cut.  "Drive South" - Reworked to sound more thoughtful.  The words are the same, but the original had an impatient energy (and tounge-in-cheek sexuality) that this version lacks.  "Angel Eyes" - He gets to record his own song here.  Excellent soulful version.  "Love in Flames" - Recent recording of a tune written in '91, its average for a Hiatt Song, but his voice gives it enough character to be glad we get to hear a new Hiatt song.  "Don't know Much About Love" - Another new/old song.  It's kind of a catchy tune.  Why do I keep wanting to sing the Supremes "Come See About Me" ("You Keep me crying, waiting for you...") during this song?  The mandolin makes this tune, and again, since its new Hiatt, its worth having.  That makes about a third of the album new (and collectable) in some way, and I like that they weren't limited by label (like "Y'All Caught? The Ones That Got Away" was) so could include "Riding with the King" (one of my favs which also he played the last time I saw him live).  The real "Best of" songs on this disc are great...but you should get the albums there on (as well!).   Like I said, if you've never heard of Hiatt, you can get this disc as a starter.  Afterward, you'll feel compelled to buy the albums anyway. 
 Very well written and researched.  This book offers a great look at the manner in which stratification develops in societies, and not just in capitalist societies.  Lenski starts with the hunter-gatherer societies and builds up to the complex structures that we have today.  Necessary reading for anyone who wants to be informed on the subject 
 This book is fun to read. Seemingly, it is very light reading as it is packed with lists, quotes and aphorisms.  This book spoke directly to me because it is the product of Dirda's life of learning. With more and more people retreating further into escapism they are missing the joys and challenges that are possible through self improvement and life long learning. Dirda is right- who knows what book will speak to whom- so keep reading a healthy variety of books and you will be amazed. Dirda provides endless recommendations for reading.  This was my first experience with Dirda- a Washington Post book editor. I have been very pleased so far. I took more notes in this book than the books I used in college.  Dirda's insights, gentle instruction and recommendation make this a memorable book (and one that I will always keep on my desk). This book will make a great gift for all readers and bibliophiles. It will also be good for those that have allowed their literary pursuits to diminish as the work is an effective call to the book life and all pleasures therein 
 "Spartacus" and JULIUS CAESAR meet "Goodfellas" in this Ancient Rome mystery that's literally classic noir. You can smell the wine and the sweat from a female gladiator named Amazonia, a.k.a. femme fatale (literally) Chloris, who's just one of the complications auditor and secret Roman Empire sleuth Marcus Didius Falco, happily maried to partner in solving crime Helena, runs into while on holiday in Britain after an old enemy, Verovolcus, who's connected to native Britain king Togidubnus, is found stuffed down a well in a gin, er, wine joint named the Shower of Gold, after the form Jupiter (that's Zeus to you Greek fans) took to seduce one of his many conquests.  The description of ancient Romans living with ancient Britons is a vivid portrait of the age and the headaches of colonization. Marcus, formerly a man acquainted with the seamy side of life that old girlfriend Chrloris represents, now finds himself going up against it again when he uncovers evidence that Verovolcus' death may be linked to organized crime through a wimp of a mob boss whom Tony Soprano would whack on the spot. Not only that, the wimp boss in question has a personal grudge against hero and Falco friend L. Petronius Longus, who in turn has a personal, intimate tension with Falco's widowed sister Maia, who, in true noir tradition, reportedly is kidnapped by the mob in the book's final third.   But all is not as it seems...and you'll have fun deciphering the ending with Marcus and his cast of strong women.  
 This audio book was a great source of information, not only for helping me figure out my past anger issues, but how to deal with future issues.  The examples in the book were real life and I could place myself in those situations.  I have listened to it more than once, and I still keeping finding ways to avoid anger and work on the real issues with my kids, parents, co-workers and spouse.  Again, a must for everyone...it may sound strange,but would make a great wedding present 
 How can you not love the antics when blueblood DeDe Halcyon goes to a wimmin's festival and accidentally lets in the homophobes? Or how about when Booter falls asleep on his boat and drifts into Wimminwood and is kidnapped? The story and adventure continue on just as compelling as the first four editions. You will laugh, you will cry...you may find yourself all over again.. 
 I like this installment better than either 2nd GIG Vol.1 or the last installment of the first season. The potential of this series can be best illustrated by the use of Hideo Kuze in the "Inductance" episode.  Strangely, the scope of the entire season seems to be apparent by the 8th episode ( Fake Food ).  This is reminiscent of the appearance of Aoi in the 11th episode of the first season.  It makes me wonder: is the series going to meander in "stand-alone" type episodes for three installments or so, before finishing with the inevitable conclusion?  There are the usual bumps in the road... I don't know if it's the subtitle translation or what, but I sometimes feel like the script is contradicting itself.  For example: a bunch of groups calling themselves the Individual Eleven, who never identified themselves as the Individual Eleven.  Huh?!  One more thing: the huge amount of audio "hiss" during the character design features.  I don't recall this from earlier chapters.  Oh well 
 Love it, love it, love it!!!  Takes me back to the time I was stationed in Germany when I was in the Army.  All his greatest songs are on the CD.  I was hoping they would have pics of KC and his band back in the 70s.  Sure enough, they do.  It's a lot of fun listening to this CD.  I am so happy I bought it from Amazon and so thrilled to own it so I can listen to it over and over again!!!  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying such wonderful music that I can purchase.  Trust me, this won't be the last!!!  Jocelyn Har 
 This is a must for all musicians interested in afro cuban rythms or latin music overall. The percussion section is super broad and detailed. I'm currently learning bass guitar, the section is very goood as well. It also  have rythm sections, horns, piano, and strings.If you are learning conga,  bongo or timbales you must have it. It is hard to find, but worth the wait 
 C. I love to read and so when I saw THE LITTLE GUIDE TO  YOUR WELL-READ LIFE by Steve Leveen, I knew that was something I had to read . . . its subtitle--HOW TO GET MORE  BOOKS IN YOUR LIFE AND MORE LIFE FROM YOUR  BOOKS--got me even more interested.  Leveen is CEO and co-founder of Levenger, a catalog offering "tools for serious readers" . . . he shares techniques that have been used by this group, along with best practices of accomplished readers over the centuries, to come up with a short book that I almost couldn't put  down . . . it is also one that I plan to revisit often in the  future.  I particularly liked how he explained his procedure for choosing which books to read and why . . . in addition, he made me want to listen to more books on tape than I even do now . . . and, lastly, his discussion on book groups made me want to join and/or form one of my own.  Throughout the book, he also shared many marvelous quotes on reading, such as this one from Artwood H. Townsend: "Never force yourself to read a book that you do not enjoy. There are so many good books in the world that it is foolish to waste time on one that does not give you pleasure."  For a book of just 123 pages, I was amazed that there were so many passages that caught my attention . . . among them:  Book love is something like romantic love. When we are reading  a really great book, burdens feel lighter, cares seem smaller and common places are suddenly delightful. You become your best optimistic self. Like romantic love, book love fills you with a certain warmth and completeness. The world holds promise. The  atmosphere is clearer and brighter; a beckoning wind blows  your hair.  John Armato, a public relations executive, cherishes his growing  Library of Candidates. When people ask him if he's actually read all those books, he asks them if they've actually eaten all the  food in their kitchen. "It is good to put up a supply of books; it increases the odds that you'll have what you want when you're  hungry for it," he says.  There is some merit in being sure that you dislike the whole of a book versus only the first part. But most avid readers I've  interviewed have learned over the years the art of knowing when  to give up. Many apply a fifty-page rule: if you don't like it after fifty pages, close the book and move on. 
 The Brazilian film "House of Sand" is a story of three generations of women, but it's also an allegory of the tenacity and continuation of life. The film begins in 1910 when Vasco de Sa (Ruy Guerra) drags his new bride Aurea (Torres) and her mother Dona Maria (Fernanda Montenegro) out into the middle of a desert wasteland. After an arduous journey, accompanied by workers toting various household objects, they arrive right in the middle of ... precisely nowhere--one sand dune looks amazingly like the rest here, and Vasco announces that they've arrived at their new home, and he has the deed to prove it.   Deserted by their workers, Vasco, Aurea and Dona Maria are effectively marooned, but Vasco is undaunted and he builds a house on the sand. Aurea and her mother are horrified and want to return to civilization. At this point, it becomes obvious (if you didn't already suspect it) that Vasco is quite mad. The fact that he waves around his deed to a large plot of sand is a good indication, but when it's combined with his desire to actually build a house on the sand, no more proof of his insanity is needed.   Aurea spends years of her life trying to escape this desolate place, and the film covers her struggles and also eventually covers the life of her daughter, Maria. The women survive thanks largely to the assistance of the descendants of runaway slaves who live nearby managing to eek a living from the harsh terrain. Even though slavery has ended in Brazil, the runaway slaves (and their descendants) aren't particularly interested in the news that they can now return to 'civilization.'  On one hand, the continual shifting of the sand offers no permanence to these desert dwellers whatsoever, and yet the film's characters are firmly locked into this inhospitable location. They make homes and they survive--life continues--although its fragility is a constant. Maria's plight is particularly pathetic as she grows up completely wild. Montenegro and Torres remain on the screen throughout the film--with Montenegro playing the aging Aurea in 1942, and Torres playing an adult Maria. Torres and Montenegro are mother and daughter in real life, and Torres is married to the director.  "House of Sand" is a beautiful film. Some scenes of the sand are so blindingly white, it almost appears as though the characters live in deep snow, and this particular area of the desert is subject to terrific storms--the puddles become a vast area of water during the rainy season. Directed by Andrucha Washington, the film is in Portuguese with subtitles--displacedhuma 
 Even though this release by the Butthole Surfers is MY personal favorite of their entire repertoire,I've heard some older fans comment they didn't care for it much.'Electric...' is less perverse,than say the likes of their 'Locust Abortion Technician' effort.Cuts I seem to remember carrying more than their own weight were "Pepper","Ulcer Breakout","The Lord Is A Monkey","TV Star" and the CD closer,the unforgetable "Space".Saw the band on this very tour and I was blown away.Have a strong feeling their tours that followed were a bit scaled down.Straight to the point:just great heavy alternative rock.Recommended.Might appeal to some fans of Flaming Lips,The Cramps,Sonic Youth and Jesus Lizard 
 This is a wonderful story about a young girl's Oma who is moving into a retirement home. It shows how hard it can be for her grandmother moving from the home she's known for so long, and trying to adjust to her new surroundings. It teaches a lot of empathy for the elderly, but without being preachy. My own daughter calls her grandparents "Oma" and "Opa" (German for Grandmother and Grandfather) and although her Oma isn't quite read for retirement yet, and doesn't make cabbage soup and strudel, it really helped bring the story to life for her. Every child can probably find a bit of their own grandparents in the story. The illustrations are as excellent as the story 
 America isn't a very safe place to live.  I'm not talking about crime rates, but about death rates, or more specifically health expectancy rates, which is the length of time a person can expect to live in good health, living independently and productively with a sound mind and body.  The United States ranks 24th, dead last among all developed countries.  Why?  What is so toxic about the American lifestyle?  Well, the old saying goes, if you want to spot a counterfeit, go study a genuine dollar bill.  Likewise, if you want to spot what's wrong with America, why not go study the healthiest people on Earth?  Well, that's what two brothers, one a physician and one an anthropologist, have been doing for the past decade in the islands of Okinawa, studying over 400 centenarians--people over 100 years old.  And not decrepit, demented shells over 100 either-- people still living in their homes, gardening, walking to market daily, chatting with friends.  Why are they living so long?  Why are their bodies on almost every biochemical measure 20 years younger or more than equivalent American bodies?  That's the subject of the book The Okinawa Program, and a fascinating read it is.  The authors both try to describe the health and lifestyle of the Okinawan culture, try to explain what is healthy about it, and then how to incorporate it into our lifestyle.  The distinctives that the authors bring out chapter by chapter are a healthy primarily vegetarian diet, regular exercise, a low-pressure lifestyle, use of meditation and other forms of stress-reduction, a close supportive social network, and their "spirituality" which is mostly positive and optimistic in nature.  The book itself is well-written and documented as far as this genre goes.  It's only downfall (also common to the genre) is tunnel-vision.  The authors' enthusiasm for all things Okinawan rarely points out anything negative at all about the culture, to the point that you wonder how objective they really are.  Beyond that, they often downplay the very tenuous nature of drawing conclusions about looking backwards and trying to figure out why things are a certain way-- you can use common sense and a little science to make a good guess that eating foods high in flavinoids may extend life, but limited science plus common sense has led us down the wrong path many a time before.  Another major point to be made is that these non-Christian authors cannot perceive the difference between mere religion (which they apparently believe is generically good for both its placebo like effect on the human body and possibly tapping into some generic higher power) vs. a genuine relationship with the genuine God.  Of course, this draws a rather brutal line in the sand for those of us who do name the name of Christ.  If our lives have truly been touched by the living God, then why are we dying by the droves in our gluttony and physical laziness and frantically paced American lifestyles, while people who do not know the true God over the ocean are living lives which I suspect more closely model what Christ would have us live?  Food for thought, and a worthwhile book to read and ponder 
 If you cannot afford a latest edition, even the previous incarnation, 2003, 2004, still has much useful info.  I am just hoping that people will give this as gift to inspire all those authors (just born or lost hope of being in print).   Thank you Jeff for the good work. I failed to find your email address to inquire matters professional.  
 Scott is a marvelous teacher. The book covers everything from language syntax to functional programming with ease and depth. The study of programming languages though skipped by most programmers is an essential element if you want to be a better programmer. The exercises given at the end of chapters are excellent and will reinforce your understanding. At a time when programming languages are proliferating at an amazing rate, it is essential you know how to compare the various aspects of different languages and choose the one most suitable for your work. Studying this will help you in that endeavour. Get this book, but better read it 
  I've just finished page 341, the last page. It's midnight here in these Connemara hills and I can't rest. I'm unsettled. I need to write something about this book. But what? Do I love it? Do I hate it? In the beginning I felt like quitting after every ten pages, then continuing after the next ten pages, and so on, and so on. I felt myself both repulsed and seduced. Eventually I gave in. Gave in to Nick Flynn's words, sentences, story, language, world, universe. The universe of Nick Flynn's disfunctional family: his alcoholic, delusional, absentee father and his suicidal mother, form the foundation of this memoir. In large measure it's a journey in search of his father, a man who lives by his wits, fuelled by alcohol, driven by the delusion/fear of writing the 'Great American Novel' (with a million dollar advance and the Nobel prize certainties in that delusion), to eventual homelessness on the street. It's also Nick Flynn is search of himself. But it's none of the above. It's truly a work of literature that sets out, on every page, to capture, and lose, the mystery of the human condition. It's surreal, a glimpse at a parallel universe that we may all be living. This book finds a kinship with Joyce and Beckett, and it's no wonder that Nick Flynn chooses an excerpt from Beckett's 'Endgame' to open the story: HAMM: Scoundrel! Why did you engender me? NAGG: I don't know. HAMM: What? Why didn't you know? NAGG: That it'd be you.   You will be haunted by this story long after you've finished reading it.  
 Great book. It crystalizes what we already know intuitively; 'Me Tarzan, you Jane'. Doesn't matter who is who, as long as there's only one of each in the relationship! It makes you look back at all of your relationships and clearly see who the masculine energy person was and who the feminine energy person was. It all makes sense 
 I just picked up this book and have enjoyed it greatly.  Thieves' World and the city of Sanctuary are such rich settings, and these authors explore that setting to great effect.  I've only read about half the volume thus far, but highly recommend it based on what I have read.  You'll enjoy this especially if you enjoy the whole 'shared world' concept (like I do).  The stories are solid and the characters well-written.  I strongly recommend the stories by Jody Lynn Nye, Robin Wayne Bailey, the 2 by CJ Cherryh & Jane Fancher, and Selina Rosen.  And by all means, if you enjoy these stories, check out these authors' other works.  Each one has a unique and entertaining style.  Congratulations and a hearty 'thank you' to Lynn Abbey for reviving the wonderful and engaging Thieves' World 
 This is a fascinating and useful new approach to the question of Hume on miracles, including many of the original essays relevant to the debate, plus an extended argument using Baysian probability logic. The result was quite eye-opening, and, although the classic arguments of Hume have an Enlightenment aura, there is a need for a more robust approach to the skeptic stance toward miracles. I doubt if theologians will get any ammunition from this argument. In the period of the New Age movement when a book like Ouspensky's In Search of the Miraculous is used by sufi sharks to lure people into cultic dependencies we need more than Hume's classic but limited consideration. Perhaps a warning about Mephistopheles and Faust might help. There is something historically apt in the treatment here, since the use of Baysianism is also its history, in simultaneity historically with the life and times of Hume.  Great little book. I found this looking for the author's other book, Bayes or Bust, which I didn't obtain, but which looks interesting as a resource for this one. 
 If you love Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, you'll love this movie. Probably the first adaptation on film of Jane Austen's novel, it is a great one.  Greer Garson is lovely and Laurence Olivier is handsome.  Black and White, yes, but the touch is light and not as intense as newer versions that are more close to Ms. Austen's actual work.  Great lighthearted chick flick 
 Most of the stories in this book are tight, well written, and present the reader with enough twist and turns to keep the pages turning. "The Witness for the Procecution", with the ultimate surprise ending, will always be a mystery-o-phile's favorite - and humor lovers will enjoy the  "Mystery of the Spanish Shawl". Poriot fans will probably  recognize the revamped "Second Gong" but it doesn't take away  from the gems in this collection. All in all this is a must have for all  mystery readers 
 This is the third of the series by Penny Vincenxi. This book is defintely a "must read" for people who like sagas and modern history. Miss Vincenzi manages to bring life to the characters in the book, and while telling the story of the life of Celia, she very successfully brings in happenings in the world, especially England and United States by using real characters, politicians etc., that lived during those year- thereby making recent history become alive on the pages of the book.  Unfortunately, this book ends the saga of the Lyttons, hopefully she will write a continuation. Galsworthy did it with the Forsytes, hopefully Miss Vincenzi will do the same.  A very enjoyable read 
 Honestly you're paying $20-30K+ and you have no idea what you should be getting, doing or how. Buy the book, give it to your wife and make sure you bring it to Russia!  I don't write reviews and I rarely read reviews on amazon. But after buying the 6+ books on adoption, this was the only one we needed (Dad's opinion). Read it and take it with you to Russia, we just got back (7/21/2004) and the book was right on. Everything from the Russian documents, translated to english and certified to the free internet access on the 4th floor of the Marriot Taverskaya in Moscow 
 This is a compilation of TMBG rarities that were previously only released online, on singles or on the McSweeney's bonus cd.  Almost all of the tracks are excellent (with the exception of the McSweeney's tracks which just sound odd and out of place).  TMBG's patented sense of humor is rampant throughout ("Words Are Like" and "Disappointing Show" will have you laughing out loud) and many of the tracks are real rockers.  Now, there are some songs on here most TMBG fans are already sure to have (the tracks from the "Working Undercover For The Man" EP, "Token Back To Brooklyn" which was a hidden track on "Factory Showroom" and "Oranges" which was a hidden track on "No!") but the album works so well on a whole that it doesn't really matter.  Ironically, the album's weakest track is the title track which is long and boring and doesn't hold a candle to the previously released live version from "Severe Tire Damage".  
 The Gift Of The Magi is a magnificent "radio theater" production of O. Henry's classic story of young love at Christmas time. A young couple just beginning their wedded life and of very limited means want more than anything to give each other a gift that will reflect and celebrate their devotion, one to the other. The gifts they select, and at the cost to each of them, all result in one of the most endearing, heartwarming, and humorous of conclusions. This highly recommended, multicast production is a flawlessly performed and recorded, totally engaging, wonderfully entertaining dramat-ization 
 I am almost completing "Capote: A Biography" by Gerald Clarke and my head is still reeling from the after effects. I loved the book. I haven't seen the movie yet but I know that it is bleak considering the book is not a light read either. Capote's life has been contained marvelously in this book. It has character and a lot of substance.   I wonder why every genius's life is so melancholic. Capote's life was no exception either. Abandoned by his parents at an early age he was forced to stay with his old cousins at Monroeville, Alabama and kept fantasizing about the day his parents would come and take him away. The day did come and Capote met his first love: New York City. Mr. Clarke's description of the New York Capote grew up in and flourished as a writer is simply outstanding. You can almost see all the sights and inhale its smells. Capote - the name was that of his step-father who eventually adopted him and who Truman grew close to.   One would think that "homosexuality" would run strong in the book considering Truman's preference; however that is not the case. What is captured brilliantly is his rise from working as a copy boy for "The New York Times" to becoming one of the famous twentieth century writers. His flamboyance, wit, anger, a streak of bitchiness, lavishness, fastidiousness and ultimately is downfall. Everything that Capote stood for is interestingly written about. Right from his affairs to his one-liners to his impulsive behaviour and his kindness [which wasn't known to all] to the torture a writer goes through while working on a book [it took him six years to finish "In Cold Blood" which is now heralded as a modern classic] and the frustration when the accolades aren't enough. The book successfully depicts his many friendships with the rich and the known to the downfall when he published a part of "Answered Prayers" [his self-proclaimed masterpiece] in Esquire and the characters were based on his rich friends, who did not forgive him for that.   This is the first time ever that I am reading a biography of a writer's life and I am so inclined to pick up more biographies of my favourite writers. To want to know more about their lives. I think next on my list has to be either F. Scott Fitzgerald or Anais Nin.   What I also loved about this book was that Mr.Clarke does not mince words at any stage. It is as real and honest as any biography can ever get. Tragic life of a Genius and ultimately how he all drained it away! Absolutely Fantastic!  
 I got this as a gift for a friend, but I have always had great luck with the Visual Quickstart books and would recommend them to anyone who needs to learn an application 
 The first few chapters of this book are daunting. They are filled with medical jargon that the average ADDer has a hard time getting through. Stick with it though or skip it and the rest of the book breaks it down thus being a valuable resource. 
 so i recently read that blind melon was "one of the worst bands of all time" according to blender magazine. i couldn't believe that there is someone out there that has the balls to say something like that. i guess these days if music is too creative, different, or has any type of real emotion, then it's too much for the average listener to handle. this album is one of the most creative records i have ever heard! there are so many different sounds, ideas, and emotions present. everything about this band was unique. everything. if you actually like music. actually like to sit and listen to music. if you understand the magic an album can hold, then this is the album for you. if you are looking for something quick easy and to the point, i know this site sells creed records too. 
 Thanks Tom! We're just starting a new technology business and we're wanting and needing to create the sort of culture that you have at Ideo. Our industry is dynamic, so if we're not dynamic then we will not succeed. For us that means innovate - deliver true value to our customers - learn - innovate - deliver more value to our customers, in a continuous cycle. You have given us some practical ideas about how we can ingrain innovation into our culture as we grow. Thanks 
 I'm one of those people who grew up in the fifties and sixties listening to top 40 radio out of Philadelphia, especially WIBG with Joe Niagra and Hi Lit.  I always loved the vocal groups that kind of got pushed aside by the British invasion groups.  When the Doo Wop Boxes came out I was thrilled to be able to hear the old groups like the Spaniels, Flamingos, Hearts, Belmonts and others.  It made me want to dig deeper into those fantastic sounds, so I started searching for more.  I remembered the Dubs hits like "Crying in the Chapel" and "Could this Be Magic", but wasn't familiar with some of their other recordings, so when I came across this CD I picked it up.  It was a real eyeopener.  Cuts like "Is There a Love For Me" (my absolute favorite), "Your Very First Love" and "You're Free to Go" are just as good as their more well known tunes.  In fact, I agree with another reviewer who said that there is not a bad cut on the whole CD. If you are a lover of Doo Wop, this is a CD you will want in your collection 
 Classic work of art.  Wonderful read.  Not for the pop-bubble gum culture crowd.  
 This album iz there second best.  Gang Stories got this album on da move.  If ya like gangsta rap check out this album and All Day Everyday.  All Day Everyday iz their best album yet.  If ya like da S.C.C. and want ta hear  more check out South Central Maddess or look under Havoc & Prode'je.   There iz also da MurderSquad.  'N Gatz We Truss iz also well worth amazon's  prices 
 'More Home Cooking' by Laurie Colwin is the kind of book that really makes you wish you could become friends with the author. Unfortunately, the author is no longer with us and I believe this volume was published posthumously, so there is a lot more than the usual barrier between celebrity and mere mortal between reader and writer.  Like the first volume, 'Home Cooking', chapters in the book are essays composed of both culinary and autobiographical material, although the book is not a memoir a la Ruth Reichl's two books. It is also not culinary criticism or exposition in the style of John Thorne. It is most similar to the kind of essays written by M.F.K. Fisher and Elizabeth David, one of the author's heroes.  In one of her essays, Ms. Colwin puts her finger on a reason for the popularity of cookbooks and cooking shows in the face of what some people claim to be the disappearance of home cooking. Reading about cooking is simply very comforting and reassuring. I find that I may not learn a whole lot from a particular Ina Garten or Paula Deen or Sara Moulton show on the Food Network, but it is certainly reassuring to watch, if even for the fourteenth time, how Ina cooks salmon so she can have it at two different meals with her guests being none the wiser regarding the doubling up on the effort.  Ms. Colwin gained this insight by reading Elizabeth David's 'Italian Food' while under the influence of a particularly acute hangover. And, her admiration of David's style is well demonstrated in the way Ms. Colwin writes recipes. There is none of the formal list of ingredients at the top with neatly laid out prep instructions so one can do their mise en place in true French brigade fashion. This is straight from Elizabeth David's spare recipe writing style done at a time when home cooks knew a lot more about cooking than they do today, or that at least is the patter among the Cassandras of modern culinary journalism.  Fortunately, Ms. Colwin's writing is less about cooking technique than it is about how we do and should think about cooking and food. It is to culinary journalism much like the editorial pages are to political journalism.  Like all very good culinary journalism such as that done by Anthony Bourdain and Michael Ruhlman, this is stuff you can read and reread on rainy March afternoons. It is doubly good in that Ms. Colwin is speaking from a quarter she knows well, the slightly atypical American housewife.  Very highly recommended culinary reading. Recipes are more for inspiration than real life cooking, unless you just love to deconstruct Elizabeth David recipes. 
 	The third Book of Ember is out! Prophet of Yonwood is a prequel to The City of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau. It explains how everybody wound up in an underground city in the first place. 	Prophet of Yonwood starts with the story of eleven-year-old Nickie goes down to Yonwood with her Aunt Crystal who, along with Nickie's mother, inherited Greenhaven, Nickie's Great-Grandfather's house. They are going to fix up the house to sell. Nickie wants to keep the hose, not sell it, so she draws up a to-do list. She must keep Greenhaven, fall in love and do something to help as it badly needed it. The U.S. and the Phalanx Nations are pretty much arguing but people are worried that this could lead to war.  Nickie spends a lot of time alone in the gigantic house because Crystal is often out running errands. Nickie goes exploring around the house and finds an old photograph of the first Siamese twins Chang and Eng. She also finds a closet and in it she finds a seventeen-year-old named  Amanda and her dog Otis. Amanda tells Nickie about Yonwood starting with Althea Tower's fiery vision.  Althea went into her backyard when her vision hit her in the head like a speeding train she fell over and beheld the sight of a world burning in destruction. Althea has since been staying in bed. Her neighbor, Brenda Beeson, has been taking note of Althea's mumblings so as to take action. She believes that Althea's vision is a glimpse into the future, which could be coming soon what with the conflicts with the Phalanx Nations.  Allegedly, whatever Althea says must be done in order to prevent her vision from becoming a reality, such as when she muttered "no singing" and all radios Cud's and such were all done away with and those who failed to comply would be punished with an indestructible bracelet hums constantly, people go crazy over it.  Amanda becomes Althea's live-in caretaker and decides to leave Otis in Nickie's care.  Nickie meets Brenda and, in an attempt to accomplish her goal to help the world, she help Brenda find wrongdoing so that they can "build a shield of goodness"  as Brenda said. Nickie finds a boy who keeps snakes in his shed and informs Brenda of him. Nickie also meets a boy her age named Grover, he is interested in herpetology, she then realizes that he is the boy she told Brenda about. They become friends, but one day  Grover is ambushed with a bracelet so he goes out in the woods to hide. Nickie feels ashamed of herself and asks Crystal about the difference between right and wrong and realizes that Brenda is wrong. Nickie then goes to the Althea's house and yells at her asking wht=y she said all of the things she said, Athea "wakes up" and then aks what has been going on, Nickie tells Althea about all of the things that have been happening since her vision and Althea explains to Nickie that she was descrin=bing her vision which kept coming back to her. In her vision there were no lights no singing and no dancing. 	All the while Brenda misinterpreted Althea and had, instead preventing her vision, creating it.Out of frustration, Brenda decides to study theology at home to find out what god is really saying. Nickie goes home to the city and is greeted with the good news that she, Otis her Mother and Father will be moving to California. The couple that wanted to buy Greenhaven withdrew their offer and Crystal moved there with her new husband and had two children. The conflicts between the U.S. nd the Phalanx Nations were resolved but started up again many years later. A city was built underground and a select few were allowed into it. Nickie being the daughter of one of the builders was taken in, she was sixty years old. The city would be called Ember.  	I like how this book was told from two different viewpoints. This wasy the reader gets to see in two different places with two different people.  The reader also gets to hear two different sides of  a similar story and two different opinions. Often in stories told in third person limited to one main character the reader only gets to hear one opinion which gets smusheed in your face as if to say "this is what you need to think!" but that was not the case in this book. I also think it's interesting to see both points of view when two people are making friends with each other because the reader to gets to see what they both think about each other and  what they both thought of time spent together.  	I alos liked how this book showed how people are affected even when conflict doesn't become war and how the situation affects everybody. When Crystal and Nickie wanted to take the train, they couldn't because it was shut down for security purposes and when they left the state they hat to be searched, 	Another thing I liked about thi book was that it showed how information is misinterpreted so often, especially God's word. Everyone was convinced  Althea was delivering God's word when realy, it was just her describing the glimpse of the horrible future. Of course part of the reason she was misinterpreted in the firest place was because there was international conflict, the people needed to believe that there was something they could do to protect themselves, because everyone was so on edge, few people considerd how unreasonable everything was.  	My main reason for liking this book was that, in spite of all, there was a happy ending and Nickie got everything done on her to-do list. The people who were buying the hoyse withdrew to offer and Nickie went to visit her Aunt there in the sumrtime so she essentialy got to keep Greenhaven. She fell in love at Yonwood, not with a person but with Otis, her dog. She got to help the world because she sold her icture of Cheng and Eng and sent the money to Grover. He went to a herpetology gathering and this led him to his career in herpetology, and he went on to discover a powerful painkiller in snake venom.  I really like this book very much, I have already read it twice I would also recommend the redt of he series  as it is very good as well 
 I hope everyone realizes that this book is not actually meant to be used in France.  I mean, there may be a rare occasion or two where you might actually be able to put it into practice, but for the most part I wouldn't recommend it.  Some of the phrases are extremely insulting or are exaggerated for comic effect.  What I mean is that French people don't really go around saying that the wine they're drinking has "wrinkled buttocks."  The entire series of "Wicked" books is, in my opinion, one big tongue-in-cheek kind of joke.  They work best for people who have been to these countries and/or have familiarity with some of the customs and thus can appreciate the humor.  They're tiny, fun, and cheap; I've had mine for years and I still thumb through them from time to time for a quick laugh.  Howard Tomb and the illustrator, Jared Lee, have more than a touch of comic genius 
 Often we encounter new insights that some if not most people will resist immediately.  This may happen with this book because of the relationships being made between what is often refered to as objective biological science and subjective religion.  However, insight, especially divine insight, is often a result of finding a relationship between two concepts that seem completely unrelated, and yet in this books case, you will find are vastly related and perhaps a holy grail.  Like it or not, open your mind and heart and when Brian's inspired understanding settles in your heart, it's truth will set you free 
 This is a great WWII paratroopers book. It is very detailed with the fighting, which i love, but not very emotionally tuned in. His emotions are there, but he doesn't really voice his opinions that much. It's pretty straight forward, but with very good, detailed writing. For anyone who liked David Webster's writing in Parachute Infantry, I wouldn't really recommend this as a must read. It resembles the writing in Band of Brothers, but more personal, less technical, and easier to follow. I personally loved it and can't wait to read his other writings 
 I love this little fan.  It's perfect for cooling one person.  I have it on my nite table and use it every night.  Amazingly quiet and soothing air. 
 For both scholars and fans of Indian cinema, this revised and updated edition is a crucial resource: there's nothing else close to it for information on Indian film -- but it's also compulsively readable.  I keep  finding myself using it to check a fact, and then browsing through it as  one entry leads to the next.  I suspect the previous edition, only  published in hardback, was out of the price range of many who would have  appreciated it, but this very inexpensive paperback edition should allow  the book to get into the hands of anyone who has an interest or passion for  Indian cinema.  The illustrations are great too 
 I found this to be one of the better books about Iran.  It is detailed and provides insights many authors do not give.  Nikki Keddie knows Iran better than most authors who have recently been published and disputes many of their findings with good reason.  The book is heavy on the financial aspects of Iran and sees that as a major motivational factor regarding the revolution.  Its one fault may be that to some degree fails to see the power of religion and tries to fit everything into a secular, rational, financial way of thinking rather than the emotional and reactionary responses religion can bring.  It is a must read if you are truly interested in the history of Iran to the present day 
 At first I didn't want to read a book about someone on death row but I figured, it's John Grisham it will probably be good and it is.   This books is not an action packed book like some of his others, the Pelican Brief, The Firm or Runaway Jury but it is thoroughly interesting.   It takes this KKK member named Sam Cayhill who is on death row and talks about his life and how he got there. It's really quite a sad story for not only him and his victims but also his family who has been torn apart because of his actions, those that have left him on death row and some of those that did not.   It's really quite moving reading about the emotions that come to everyone involved when someone is about to be gassed etc and John Grisham does a wonderful job slowly leading you to that point.  This book might not change your opinion on the death penalty but it will definitely let you look at it differently through the eyes of a prisioner and his family etc.   A good read for those who have time for a slower paced book that leads to a purpose. If you need nonstop action in a book then this is not the one to pick up.    
 THIS LCD MONITOR FLAT SCREEN TV SWING ARM IS GREAT.  NOW WE CAN ENJOY THE TV OUTSIDE WHILE ENJOYING OUR HOTTUB AT THE SAME TIME.  IT IS TOTALLY HEAVEN HAVING SUCH A PRODUCT LIKE THIS.  BEING IN THE HOTTUB AND HAVING TO WATH TV IS JUST PURE ENJOYMENT 
 I always loved this story as a child, so it is one that I have inflicted on my daughter (almost 4) in hopes that she would love it as well. We were planning a trip, so I purchased the audio version so she could listen to the story while we were driving. While it is not the PC version where the first and second little pigs get away and run to the home of their brother with the brick home (they are actually eaten as each of their homes is huffed and puffed to the ground)--it is still a great story and provided hours of entertainment. We are constantly finding the value of books with tapes for car travel and it helps a lot when the books are well written and illustrated. This one is all of that and more 
 There is no question when I tell you that Amy rocks out loud live! She definately knows how to work the crowd. During her performance, she and the rest of the band do a KoRn cover of "Thoughtless" (which I LOVE) and also perform two other songs not found on the U.S. version of 'Fallen' including Breathe No More (from Elektra soundtrack) and Farther Away (from the Bring Me to Life Single and/or Jap. version of Fallen) Of course, any true Ev fan would already know all of that info. The dvd includes the entire live performance, all the music vids from Fallen, and some behind the scenes footage of the whole band. (Some of it is really funny) A great buy 
 In many ways this is a brilliant work.  It's difficult to review now since our tastes have changed and since part of its value was in its originality -- which has been built upon by more modern authors.  Thus, it is a true classic.  One's valuation of it has much to do with whether one evaluates it in the context of the 19th century or the 21st.  Collins subtly criticizes much of 19th century English society in his treatment of Ezra, Clack, Mrs. Merridew, etc.  Even Betteredge's reliance on "Robinson Crusoe" seems to reflect on Victorian religious mores (i.e. perhaps (?)  an allusion to the Bible).  Differences in social mores today can be seen in both Rachel's & Rosanna's coverups etc.   The basic structure of the book--a series of eyewitness accounts reminds one of certain TV shows & the normal operation of our police or CSIs--where evidence is uncovered bit by bit though interviews & re-interviews.  Today's mysteries rely on yesterday's just as today's sitcoms rely on Shakespeare's comedies.  Collins appears to succeed overall in well-defining his characters and their styles along with their assumptions, prejudices, etc.  However, as Collins states in his Author's Preface, "The attempt made here, is to trace the influence of character on circumstances" vs. its opposite per most other novels.  This is a lengthy & enjoyable (though at times a bit tedious & wordy) novel--not really escape fiction as with many of the pseudo mysteries of today (more suspense story than legitimate mystery with clues etc. that are fair to the reader).  Its values are much deeper.  It may not become your favorite, but it's well worth discovering 
 After reading some negative reviews of this book, I needed to buy and read it myself.  I couldn't believe that if the story was so bad, they would be making a movie of it.  I believe that this is a charming "old-fashioned fantasy" ... nothing more, so why make it anything else?  Let children read and enjoy the story.  After all, it is not meant to entertain adults.   Silver horses, magic, and peculiar circustances don't need to alarm the children who read the book or see the movie.  I, for one, am anxious to see how this story is transformed for the screen.  I will let my imagination run free with the little white horse, and simply enjoy the movie as pure and delightful amusement.   I recommend this book for children to enjoy and anticipate the plot as the storyline develops.  Their imagine will soar! 
 The Ghost And The Darkness is a fabulous film, and unlike The moronic, and ridiculous review from The New York Post,people who appreciate true, adventure films will enjoy this great movie.I invite the critic who slammed this film in his Post Review to take a trip to Tsalvo and camp-out there,then explain to the villagers how unrealistic this story was. Director Michael Douglas'Role in this movie was fine, PLUS he's married to Catherine Zita Jones...EAT YOUR HEART-OUT NEW YORK POST!             
 This book is a keeper! If you like the Horatio Hornblower series and such good tales of the sea, then I feel quite sure that you will not be disappointed with this easy-to-read excellent account of Nat Bowditch.   When I read a great book like this, I want it to go on for considerably longer, and this book made me think of the Hornblower series by Forester and of Midshipman Quinn by Showell Styles...I could easily see it rewritten into a mighty tome or series but, alas!, 'tis not to be..... I can recommend this book heartily to all fans of the sea... 
 In this book Maisy and Charley go grocery shopping. My two year old loves grocery shopping and is fascinated by the book. We read it over and over and over. Actually it is great for me too, because I use it to talk about what kind of foods we can buy at the grocery store. Maisy and Charley buy apples, bananas, yogurt, bread etc... It is a good opportunity to get in a plug for nutritious foods 
 I would be hard pressed to call this a collection of short stories, as this is really a series of humorous anecdotes from an array of accomplished women, some quite funny and even a few who even provide insight into the human condition. Editor Jennifer Leo has gathered twenty-nine pieces, none more than ten pages, and to her credit, this is not an overtly feminist tract. Rather, they all share a uniquely feminine perspective on the quirks and misadventures that could happen to any of us on the road.  My favorites seem to carry similar themes of personal humiliation - Christine Eckardt's ribald story of how her loose-fitting panties were shimmying down her legs on the streets of Abu Dhabi, Sarah Vowell's singular obsession with "The Godfather" as she traversed through Italy rediscovering locales within the film, Kate Crawford getting locked out of her boyfriend's apartment in Paris, Annalisa Valentine's urinary-related disaster on the way back from Everest base camp, and Leo's own exposure to Bangkok's extravagant peep show scene.  Unsurprisingly, the highest profile writer here, Ellen Degeneres, tells of her travails with air travel, a funny routine familiar to anyone who has seen her stand-up routine on HBO. Not all the stories are gems, but Adair Lara contributes an acutely insightful essay on the person we pretend to be when we pack. he title of the collection actually comes from Christine Nielsen's colorful account of her experiences at the Burning Man festival in Nevada. This is shallow-end commuter reading but truly enjoyable for what it's worth 
 Whitmore has provided a very good secular overview and guide to coaching in Coaching for Performance (I am a Christian coach). It is easy to read and gives lots of examples of using coaching technique in everyday life and work. It appeals to me as a classic as Whitmore came in at the early days of coaching and writes with clarity and enthusiasm. In this edition outlines its development. I purchased this book as it was often quoted in the Life Caoching couse I studied as part of a theology degree.  As someone with a sporting background I find his many references to sports coaching quite natural, however I can see this as an irritation to anyone who has never experienced coaching in the sporting arena. These references however do add to the readers' understanding of coaching technique and practice. I would recommend this book to anyone new to coaching, but would suggest further study and supervised practice if you want to do more than simply use a few coaching techniques in your worlplace and everyday life 
 Overall I liked this book but there were times when the writing was a bit confusing.  I felt the author couldn't get his thoughts across to his readers.  I didn't really feel satisfied with the end.  
 "Rebecca", the book that gave Daphne du Maurier immortality, has all the features of the novel of its time. Balancing on the thin, invisible line between plain romance and deep psychological analysis, it is engrossing, for me to the point of sacrificing sleep.    The plot itself is constructed quite simply and classically, starting with the young girl - companion to the wealthy lady, falling in love and marrying the rich widower, Maxim de Winter. The young bride is the narrator of the novel and she finds itself initially incapable of understanding her husband's past (especially as she gets no direct answers) and of bearing the burden of living in Manderley, the mansion haunted by the powerful presence of his first wife, Rebecca.   In fact, the naivety and childishness of the narrator sometimes irritated me massively, she was extremely self-conscious and eager to please, so much that she could not see the obvious...Very good character, I bet this was the author's plan. But finally she undergoes the complete transformation, albeit in very dramatic circumstances, discovers the truth (a horrible secret... more than one in fact) and can be happy with her husband (this is not a spoiler, as the novel starts at this pint and is written in retrospective). Ultimately, this is a story of lack of communication which is the basis for misunderstanding, suspicions, false loyalty and the whole spectrum of emotions with which this novel if bursting.  "Rebecca" is a great classic, full of suspence, with great characters (Miss Danvers!). It is definitely worth reading even as the only book by du Maurier, to get acquainted with her style, and it is a very good novel for a long, winter evening, virtually moving the reader to the British countryside at the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the novel certainly aged, it did so gracefully, retaining all its charm 
 This is one of the best CD's I've bought in a long time.  Fantastic lyrics, great vocals, excellent backing.  Really melodic and deep thoughts.  Particularly like Dead Heart, Fake a Smile, Long Way Down, Therapy.  One of those CD's you can listen to over and over again, and get new sounds.  A terrific second album from Jonny Mead, the singer/songwriter.  Buy this and you won't be disappointed.  And if Radford are playing, go and see them.  I have, and they are terrific 
 For Love is a subdued, mature chronicle of a woman coming to terms with adult relationships. This book tells the story of Lottie, a woman haunted by her and her new husband's pasts. The tone is detached with the author perhaps purposefully distancing the readers from intense emotion. Themes in the book include love (of course) both romantic and familial, identity, loyalty, maturation, and conscious living. It is not a tale packed with action-- though it decidedly lures us with a "what will ever happen?" plot thread. Sue Miller nimbly and impressively weaves the plot back and forth through time and through the emotional state of the protaganist (Lottie). It is a first person account told in third person (hence the distancing). This device may be used to emulate the lack of connection and knowledge Lottie has with and of herself. This book presents the simple unfolding of a story completed with brilliant technique and subtlety. Would I recommend this book? Yes. It contains simple life truths which provoke soul searching and contemplation. To whom would I recommend it? Patient readers. Those willing to take the time to meander with the author and the protangonist through the often stream of consciousness narration. Was this book life changing for me? Yes. It helped me wrap my mind around two ideas that while very intuitive seemed very fresh and enrichming for me: 1) When we love people, that love will either stretch to include all different versions of them as they grow and change, or it won't... lasting love takes work in that regard. How is this work done? This leads me to idea # 2) Sometimes we have to pretend to love the changed version of a person we once loved (or pretend to embrace the true nature person who we idealized as something else) until that love can adapt and become a reality. Will this book change the way I live? It will change my perspective. If the book's philosophy is correct and thought follow actions... then yes... it will have changed my life. I enjoyed this book for it's unlikely marriage of depth and simplicity 
 There are a lot of books on how to create a web page. They vary from simple, use Front Page type books, to books on the back end process like those on .asp or php. There aren't many books that take a step back and ask questions like 'what is it that you are trying to do with this web site,' 'how easy is it for the visitor to find what he wants,' 'how does the web help fulfill the overall business mission of the organization.'   This is not a teckie book. It doesn't tell you how to do HTML, instead it is on the things you need to think about first before you start to cut code, or have someone else do the site. One of the big mistakes is who to pick to design the web site. An artist tends to make it pretty. A programmer makes it clean looking. A marketeer wants to sell things. Management has to decide the goals of the site. And management often isn't prepared to do that because of a lack of knowledge about what is possible. This book attempts to bring management up to the level of specifying a web site 
 This is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something.  But those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most under-rated films of all time.  There isn't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the movie-going crowd, but it has some of the best acting (serious and comic) & writing & imagery of any film you're likely to come across 
 I liked this book.  If you are well read in this area, I don't think that the book is for you (especially if you are a vitriolic Howard Zhin fan or an American patriot who thinks we can do no wrong.)  It is rather a general overview of the topic and ment for history students although clearly accesible to laymen.  What I liked about the book is that Levering does not throw mind numbing statistics, but simply presents the phases of the cold war. There was a heavier emphasis on the beginning phases, and I would have like to have seen more written on the latter stages. Good intro thoug 
 There are no doubt countless introductions to Greek philosophy, but amidst the vast sea of choices this book easily floats above the rest. Professor Cornford's writing is rare, he displays a clear mastery of the subject and conveys his vast knowledge in a manner that is refreshingly lucid.  There is no complex language to unpack or needless detail to confuse his presentation of the material. Cornford approaches the subject by addressing the general themes associated with the Ionians, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.  This is a nice approach because the beginner, rather than being lost in detail, is given the "big picture" with which he can then orient the details of further reading. This is the greatest virtue of Cornford's book, and it is for that reason that I so highly recommend it 
 If you enjoyed Robert Graves' "I, Claudius" and "Claudius the God", the Penguin edition of Suetonius' "The Twelve Caesars" is a must-have in your collection.  Graves wields a rich command of English vocabulary to capture the subtle nuances of Suetonius' original Latin words.  The result is a tremendously readable and clear rendition of this ancient text, with the business of language barrier thoroughly put away.  It puts the reader right back in that time.  No need to echo what many other reviewers have already assessed as the virtues of this work.  The 150 years or so featured here, from the reign of Julius Caesar through that of Domitian, are some of the most turbulent, scandalous, and horrifying in the history of the Roman Empire.  Highly recommended for all history buffs 
 A thickly philosophical novel that frustrates and challenges one's sense of self and independence. I will not try to add to the canon of literary analysis that has already been heaped upon this famous book, but it is safe to say that it will hit every reader differently. Some will love it for its achingly lonely narrative, and others will withdraw from it for the same reason. I thought that while at times it was ponderous, mostly it endures as a story about universal feelings of isolation and helplessness 
 I love the Benefit line, everything I have tried works great (not to mention they have great packaging and catchy names for all their products!).   That said, High Beam is simply amazing. It only takes a little dab to add a nice glow/shimmer to my face. I especially like to use it on the cheek bones as it leaves a nice soft glow. High Beam works so much better for me than other products I've tried that either left my skin sticky or chalky. Not to mention those other products cost a lot more!  If you are looking for a little glow, a little shimmer, High Beam is the answer 
 It's here, it's here!  I was in the record store, browsing...had earphones on and ....there it was right in front of me the holy grail of cd's - the five pennies soundtrack!  I almost did not go to the movie I went to see so I could listen to it..but I waited and did and it is as wonderful as when I heard it on vinyl.  Get this, hear Louis Armstrong at his best, some great Dixieland Jazz...enjoy 
 It seems that today people are becoming more aware of the danger that hurricanes pose, especially after the Gulf's devestation from Katrina, Wilma, and Rita; the four hurricanes to strike the Florida coast in 2004, and now Cyclone Larry which devestated Northern Queensland, Australia. Hurricanes are becoming a much talked about and even debatable topic of how to prepare, track, and live with these storms that are now on the rise.    The reader's of Isaac's Storm will get a sense that no matter what time period you live in, hurricanes prove to be a great threat if not treated with respect and caution.  This was the deadliest natural disaster to strike the United States. Many people will say this was because it happened over 100 years ago, therefore the technology and warning system was not as advanced, but Katrina proved this to be wrong.    While reading this book I was able to pull many similarities from the Galveston Hurricane and Katrina.  Most of the people to have perished in both hurricanes was due to flooding. Galveston and New Orleans are surrounded by a body of water on both sides.  Although many people did not heed the warning in Galveston (since there was no official warning), Katrina victims had ample warning, and either refused or could not leave the area under certain circumstances.   Erik Lawson gives a very detailed account of what had happened that night on September 8, 1900.  But even before he depicts the magnitute of this atrocity he goes back in time to explain how weather became a science and hurricanes were discovered by man.  After the storm has passed, the author continues to recount the aftermath and the struggle for Galveston to revive itself to it's former glory (it never has).    Isaac's Storm is a fantastic, intereting read for anyone who is interested in weather or life altering events.  If anything, you will gain a new respect for hurricanes and it may prompt you to listen and leave if you ever have to face an evacuation 
 Just saw this for the first time, and as a brit who went to a public school in the 1990s, I have to say its amazing how much of this film still rings true. The army scenes, the classes, the aggression, it is absolutely brilliant. Only wish I'd seen it when i was 17....  Interesting reading the reviews by some US viewers- they seem to assume it is much more metaphorical and symbolic than it actually is. It's less a symbol of british society, or the end of empire, than a factual documentary of what life in these schools is actually like (except for the final scenes of course). 
 If you don't have it ..go get it  
 I was given this book by my aunt who moved to Point Barrow, Alaska to be a teacher there. She gave me this book to teach me about where she was to be living. This book taught me a lot in a very educational way. I highly  recommend it, The pictures are great too! 
 Caroline Murphy has sketched an extraordinary life. Felice della Rovere's worlds -- personal and political -- were complicated ones, and she seems to have been amazing in how she negotiated them. I say "seems" because it's very often difficult to tell whether the author is basing a statement on solid evidence or whether she is taking a leap -- about an action, about a motivation, about an emotion -- a sort of best guess based on the evidence.  That's often frustrating and often downright irritating, but all in all it's worth it to see the shape, if not the real substance, of the life 
 Beautifully done 2 CD of Chopin works.  I've played it every weekend since I got it, loving every track.  It's well performed and recorded, and is an excellent collection for anyone interested in Chopin or his adopted homeland of Poland.  And, of course, you can't often go wrong with the London Label 
 This book helps you strengthen your mind so you can understand auras and what they truly mean for you and other people.  recommending:The Throne Room 
 This is a story of Lizzie she is a modern girl who like all girls she is looking for love.   This book is alittle Sex in the City, Bridget Jones all wrapped up in a Jane Austen flavor.    The book is fun and a fast book to read.  I thoroughly enjoyed.  
 Grazia Dei Rossi is an amazing woman, celebrated author, court confidant, loving mother, shrewd business woman, spirited lover,  and a Jew. She's also fictitious. The world she lived in, and most of her supporting characters, however, are brilliantly drawn and historically accurate. Grazia's story, framed as a secret memoir to her son, brings to life Italy of the 1400 and 1500s. 	At 567 pages this is no light read, but if you enjoy historical fiction, Italy, the Renascence, and a good story it is worth the effort. My only suggestion would be the inclusion of an glossary to explain some of the period Italian terminology.     
 The fact that almost all the reviews are children should tell parents one thing when considering this for their child...This is FUN and it is what YOUR children want. Imagine a great "toy" that is also an "educational tool". Parents and children are BOTH happy with this purchase. My child will be starting Spanish in the fall.....this will be a MUST in our household. Actually I want a Fly too!!!! :-)  P.S.  A great tool for the homeschooling family!! 
 I am so glad I happened upon this book! The personal experiences of Sandra, the expertise of Dr. Bill, and the spiritual issues addressed in this book have been an invaluable resource to my husband and me as we have struggled through the difficulties of infertility. This book is a terrific guide to anyone going through infertility themselves or any lay person or clergy helping a couple that is struggling. Rarely does one find a book that balances medical terminology and its great detail with the emotional and spiritual aspects of the patients' experience, but this book does. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone that is beginning the journey of infertility as it clearly gives medical information. More important to me, though, was the biblical content that reminds us that we are NOT alone through this process, that God is still God, and that the emotional roller coaster is a normal thing. Not to mention the chapter that deals with handling well-intentioned advice... great content there, too! : 
 "Spider-Man: The Ultimate Guide" is a must-have book for all the wall-crawler's fan! It has information about lots of characters and a fantastic spidey's time-line! The illustrations are as good as well, and you can even find information on alternative Spider-Man series, like Spider-Girl, and Spidey 2099. Although the book is very nicely done i still missed more detailed profiles, anyway you will sure not regret for buying this one! 
 CARRY ON WAYWARD SON REALLY SOUNDS BETTER THAN EVER ON THIS ONE SO CRANK IT UP! IT WILL BLOW YOUR DOORS OFF AND MAKE YOUR HAIR STAND UP 
 This book needs to be used with caution. There is no mention of Gunter Wand's recordings of Beethoven Symphonies and Mackerras's life enhancing cycle of Mozart symphonies is simply dismissed  because of his fast tempi as though fast tempi is synonymous with lack of expressiveness.To me Bohm's and Mackerras' views of Mozart are equally valid. If there were only one mode of interpretation, one could program a computer to play the score. To me a great work is capable of different interpretations. Morover, though the publication date is 2002, many new recordings are simply missing like Perahia's marvellous recordings of Bach's keyboard concertos.I am not replacing my Penguin or Gramophone as yet 
 Special Effects is THE BEST book you could wish for on the subject.  I have a shelf full of old, an mostly inaccurate books about special effects, but with this new book I could throw the rest away.  Also, don't bother with magazines like Cinefex anymore, which are very dry and heavy going.  this book is a pleasure to read and has interviews with everyone who is important in the business.  There are hundreds of cool photos as well which makes it very good value.  Anyone who works in special effects, or is just interested in the movies should read this book. Congratulations to the author Mr Rickitt who has condensed 100 years of movie magic into a single lavish book. Dont take my word for it - BUY IT 
 Like many others who bought this item, I was initially interested in a Le Creuset dutch oven, but was turned off by the price.  I purchased this item several months ago, and with the $25 rebate on an already low price of $130 and free super saver shipping, it was a steal.  I have been impressed with the quality of the pot and lid.  The enamel finish has been durable so far, and extremely easy to clean.  The basting spikes and attractive handle on the lid are nice touches.  
 The Prager Quartet plays Dvorak's scores with ample warmth as well as introspection. These are glowing performances which Deutsche Grammophon recorded in the late 1970's. Unquestionably, they stand as one of Deutsche Grammophon's finest recordings from that period. It is hard to see how much further they could be improved with the latest sound quality. This is a splendid compilation of Dvorak's string quartest. Judging from the caliber of the performances as well as Dvorak's excellent scores, both the performances and the scores rank beside the finest I have heard from Beethoven and Mozart. Admittedly, this might be an expensive investment, even at a budget price, yet it is definitely worth buying 
 Everything I always wanted in a bike, without having to rig it up myself. This bike is made for a wide range of uses, including mine. I like to use panniers, and this bike has rack mounts. I love a single speed.   This bike has rear-facing (track-style) dropouts- thus, I can have one gear on each side of the wheel and easily change from low to high gear without changing the chain length. This is not really the case with converted horizontal dropout frames. Other non-track single speeds on the market look like fun but lack the pannier mounts.  The large tire clearance is super fun. The first time I really noticed it was when the bike path was congested and I took off across the grass. Now I use this bike to carry me to and from my research site- 3 miles down a primitive road and over two creek crossings. So much fun. And with the aforementioned rack, I can carry tools out and samples back with ease.  And the price- for this price you get a complete bike. No self-assembly required.  For those of you unsure about purchasing and committing to a single speed check this out: this bike comes with a set of screw on gear cable guides and a screw-on rear derailleur hanger so that, if you so desire, you can convert it into a multiple speed bike in the future. This is nice to know, although I am not sure why anyone would want to deal with this.  Once you get this thing going and loaded up with 50lbs of gear, however, you might want to avoid mountain passes, unless you don't mind walking or hitchhiking 
 This book was published in 1989, so some of its facts are outdated, but this book is an excellent resource on how our human activity is directly impacting the environment and birds, and what we can do to save them.  It is a great resource for nature enthusiasts and conservationists, and is filled with beautiful paintings and photography.  I know this book is hard to find, but if you can find a used copy, definitly buy it 
 Ginger won the Oscar for playing this part despite some stiff competition.  She's decidedly out of character as a white-collar girl with an old school attitude.  I love when she grumbles, "People always make a big deal about the Old West and the brave women of the covered wagons.  They don't seem to care as much about their modern-day equivalents, the secretaries--the women of the covered typewriters."  With her quivering lower lip and her turned-up chin, she makes us care for Kitty Foyle, a girl from the poor side of the tracks who makes good with the rich playboy Wynnewood Strafford the III, or for short, "Win," played skillfully by the wonderful Dennis Morgan, possibly Hollywood's most under-rated star player of the 1940s.  Morgan could sing too but he was best playing men whose love for their leading lady was always tested by some kind of addiction or other handicap, some sort of weakness.  Here his Achilles heel is his family and their swanky social position.  Gladys Cooper would have a fit if she found out that Dennis was dating Ginger Rogers, and in the book of course, Kitty and Win don't get married but carry on a "back street" sex affair anyhow.  Moviegoers even in 1940s were agile enough to read between the lines and to guess that the baby Ginger loses in the movie was a real "love child."  You'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel strangle prickles behind your eyes, like tears, when Ginger realizes that she has lost the baby.  Luckily Dr. Mark is there to pick up the pieces--James Craig, another very good actor, playing a young intern who loves Kitty even despite the fact that her father's a boozehound and she will never enter the Social Register or Main Line Philly society.  I wonder if Grace Kelly ever saw KITTY FOYLE and based some of her choices in men on Kitty's Philadelphia binary.  Between this film and BACHELOR MOTHER you would think Ginger Rogers a very maternal figure, but anyone who met her in real life knew that there was no room for children in her heart; in some ways she was a very lonely lady despite her many accomplishments and all the famous men she attracted to her side (think "Lady in the Dark," probably the part she played that was the most like the real life Ginger Rogers.")  The subtitle of this movie was "The Natural History of a Woman" and was supposed to provide a quasi-scientific, or sociological, study of class.  Far from it, but it's a treat anyhow 
 This Engineering and Mathematics major has found "Good Reading"  incalculably helpful in furthering the liberal education that I didn't have  much time for in college. Highly recommended 
 Bernstein writes with the depth of knowledge of a university professor, and the style of popular fiction writer. He captures both the scientific and human aspects of this broad subject 
 Epson inks are wonderful, especially if used with Epson paper.  They are, however, expensive!  Consider that a printer comes with ink included.  Buying ink replacements twice is equivalent to the cost of my Epson Stylus Photo R300.    Amazon's price, ease of delivery, and quality of the product make the ink 5 stars 
 I am a topologist by training who was Shanghaied into being an analyst when I was hired as a teacher.  As a consequence of this, the Advanced Calculus course I taught was rather heavy on topology.  Over the course of time--having been transformed into more of an analyst that I would have ever dreamed--I've come to the conclusion that analysis is best learned before topology.    This is a text that accomplishes that by using the historical approach.  One learns how Newton approached problems, how Euler did, how Cauchy did.  Not only is it interesting, it is enlightening.  I've taught this course for 15 years now, and of all of the approaches I've taken, this has been the most fruitful.  My students have come from calculational courses, and the historical approach of this book provides a bridge over which they may come into the land of proof.  They also see the issues that caused the need for modern rigor face to face  I do supplement the course with material that is more modern (Hardy's book A Course of Pure Mathematics) and material on the Riemann integral, but I've been spoiled for any other approach.  
 One does not have to be a Matsubayashi Shorin Ryu practitioner to recognize the importance of this historical and highly instructional book on Traditional Okinawan Karate.  The story of how Shoshin Nagamine and Chojun Miyagi worked together to construct Gekisai Dai Ichi Kata for use in both of their systems is telling in that these great masters all new each other and trained together and worked towards promoting Karate to the world as a team.  No Traditional Karate student loses when they learn something from all of the Traditional Karate Arts from Okinawa.  I highly reccomend this book to any practioner.  It's great to have in the martial arts library 
 I have had great luck with other Opteka lenses, but I had to by a thread adapter. What is the thread size of this lens here? I need to know before I buy. Opteka, please put thread sizes of your lenses in the description. Thanks! 
 Marcus Binney's book is a wonderful introductory book for anybody wanting information on women involved in espionage during WWII.  These are remarkable stories about remarkable women, and a part of WWII history which is rarely covered.  The book gives a quick introduction to 10 women who were important to these efforts, along with a glimpse of what they went through to prepare for their missions and the price they sometimes paid.  If you want to learn about the women of the OSS, this is a great place to start, before delving into the longer volumes dedicated to the individual women (notably Violet Szabo, Virginia Hall and Vera Atkins) 
 This is the first book I have ever read by Christopher Moore and I a can't wait to read more.  One of the best fiction books I have ever read..I could not put it down and my husband and children went hungry until I was done with it!  Since the other reviewers have done such a good job summarizing the story, luckily I don't have to...I wouldn't even know where to begin. I'll just say that after I read my first Harry Potter book, I thought "Where does Rowling come up this stuff?"  What an incredible imagination.  I felt the same way after reading this book.  Don't get me wrong, this book is not for the kiddies, or the faint of heart. Very adult content, but the brilliant imagination that this man has just amazed me.  I have ordered a few more of his books and I can't wait to dig in.  I would also love a sequel as I truly enjoyed the characters in "Dirty Job."  If you loved the dark humour and original story line in the SHOWTIME original series "Dead Like Me" you will love this book 
 The author of this book is a respected economist and also a former cabinet secretary in the Clinton administration.  Published in the early 1990's, this book provides a short economic history of the US, describes the American economy at his time (the early 1990's) and what lies ahead for America.  In it, Reich covers various topics such as: industrialization, outsourcing of labor, gap between incomes, the growth of financial markets in both the number of people involved, the sums of money involved, and the influence they have on world affairs, and the role of America in world economics.    He points out trends both harmful and beneficial to America, and prescribes changes that could help America, and the world.  These include the traditional liberal stands of investing in education, securing healthcare and other social nets for the poor, protecting the environment, empowering workers, especially those at the bottom of the economic food chain, with greater power in their economic success,   The book is clearly written.  Reich is clearly a Democrat, but the book is not partisan in its treatment, and he emphasizes the importance of government budgets and tax rates in economic policy.  There were several items he should have placed more focus on; privatization of utilities, the growth of intellectual property and its effects on technological growth and individual rights, the spread of credit, and the parallel rise in bankruptcies.  In all the book tends to look at the bright side, and offers many good points for political leaders current and future to consider. 
 Grace Abounding....is an excellent autobiography of John Bunyan and his spiritual struggle to obtain assurance of his salvation in light if his belief that he had committed the unpardonable sin.  Recommended to anyone who may be facing the same struggle with this question.  Each paragraph of the text is numbered and, thus, it is easy to put the book down at any point and pick it back up later without losing train of thought.  Since the book was written over 300 years ago, it is interesting to have insight into the thoughts of a Christian who lived during that time and to compare with current Christian thinking. 
 Love is a subject that has been tackled by everyone who ever grabbed a pen and decided to write.  Some have been accurate in their depictions, but i find that i read a lot about love and don't quite connect with the emotions  or with the characters.  With this book, Laurie Colwin wiped me off my  feet.  I can totally put myself in the shoes of Jane Louise, who wants  desperately to make everything OK for her husband, who cannot understand  how someone so lovely could have been treated badly by others, who gets  outraged at the thought that her beloved suffered at some point in his  life.  This is one of the key corners of love, and i have yet to find other  authors that put their finger right there.  This was an awesome love story.   I watched a movie on PBS called "Ask me Again" some 12 years  ago, and i have not been able to forget it.  What do you know?  Laurie  Colwin wrote the script.  Thank you for leaving us with such terrific books  and movies 
 I find Mozart's piano concertos just a joy to listen to. Should there be a heaven, and should I manage to go there, I wouldn't be surprised if piano concerto no. 21 is playing on the way up. At least that is how it makes me feel when listening. Like the music of Bach, there is an underlying simplicity in Mozart's music that makes it very accessible and timeless. On a technical note, I found the sound quality very clear, and of course it does not get better than this entire cast of musicians (including the brilliant Alfred Brendel) 
 This work is full of so many laughs.  His humor was extremely rare, yet so powerful and touching.  A must have 
 It is immaculately refreshing to find what is presumably a 'dating' book to be both thoroughly researched and entirely free of the cliches and stereotypes that many contemporary writers would have engaged on the topic of the battle of the sexes.  In How to Date, there is absolutely none of that 'men are all sex-seeking slobs and women are all manipulative gold-diggers' paradigm. Mapes prose is light and funny but also sharp, clinical, even analytical at times. Her reporter's voice keeps its distance and is free of simplistic judgments. This is a book with real, from the trenches, dating stories. Gay, straight, old, young, no matter. Only people looking for love.   This author has clearly done her homework. How To Date has a timeless quality to it. There are loads of references to books on the topic from earlier times. The book feels like a classic, 20th Century study of social manners. The artwork and layout are what you would imagine Miss Lonelyhearts' column to have looked like.   But dating in our post-dating world is clearly a contemporary subject and Mapes fills the book with simple but fundamental advice. She lays out the basics of dating, the use of dating services and helps one navigate the frightful waters of Internet romance. But never taking it too seriously. This book has lots of jokes, the funniest ones in the How-To's, and the prose makes light of the subject to no end. This is a light read but only in the best sense of those words.  Now, why refer to How To Date as "presumably" a dating book? Because what we also have here is a fascinating anthropological resource that I'm sure future generations will use to hold us in the contempt and pity we deserve. The book includes dozens of first person dating stories by Mapes' many sources. Some of these are incredibly funny, others poignant, some horrific. But they are all telling of the age we live in. How we lead lives that are truly our own, which is good, but how desperately alone that can leave us.  You can read this book for advice. Read it to laugh at all those desperate singles out there or those jaded and afflicted by loves that went awry. That is, for the few among us who live in healthy, loving and lasting relationships.   But what about the rest? Bored to tears in their marriages and coasting or failing in their partnerships? In a few years, they may need this book. 
 In February 2006, the Financial Times of London reviewed “The Rise of American Democracy” by Sean Wilentz. In the review, Stephen Graubard of the FT states that “With Jackson, perhaps more than with the others, [Wilentz} revises and expands on the excellent findings of Arthur Schlesinger Jr, still the classic biography today, more than half a century after its original publication.” 
 As a 14 year old girl in Baltimore Md I was given this book to read by my uncle in 1972, I have been reading it every 5 years or so now at 46 it remains one of my favorite books, i am purchasing it today for my 14 year old nephew, i hope he learns as much from it as i did 
 This is a great coffee table book that includes many important paintings of Art Institute of Chicago. All the images are in color, and the story of each painting and the artist is given. Each painting is described on a  single page, and therefore the pictures are sufficiently large and  detailed. The book starts with 15th century religious paintings, and  progresses to include well known impressionist paintings such as Seurat's  Sunday on La Grande Jatte and Renoir's Two sisters. It also has a section  on 20th century paintings. Not a substitute to seeing the actual works, but  it is close.. 
 This book is one of the best needlework books on the market. The stitch diagrams cover needlepoint, cross stitch and embroidery and includes information on fabric, canvas, fibers and embellishments. I would recommend  this book to stitchers of all levels 
 Complacency is one of the biggest enemies of any organization, but especially for successful ones like Intel. ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE provides two powerful observations that will help anyone who reads this book: (1) That changes are lurking out there that need immediate attention inside your organization and (2) That you must be constantly vigilant for large discontinuous changes (such as those driven by microprocessors, Intel's main product). Having the perspective of someone who has been both the beneficiary and the target of discontinuous change, Dr. Grove's lessons become all the more real. At first, I thought this book was a little overdone; but upon reflection, I feel that complacency is probably best overcome by paranoia in the absence of the management process to locate, anticipate, create and adapt to externally-driven discontinuous changes. I often cite this book in our writings about how to be more successful, because I believe it is an important work. Please read this book, and take its lessons seriously. But have fun while you are being paranoid 
 The Perfect Store tell us the real story of how a dream might be reallity. it invites us to trust in our dreams an work (smart) towards it. for people like me - non native english speaker - its reading isn't so heavy so it's possible enjoy the whole book. - but I recomend having a good dictionary beside ;)  thank you  Mr. Omidyar for divide your dream with us 
 Wells wanders around Paris, gathering recipes from her friends, grocers, mentors, and even taxi drivers; that turns out to be fine, since she knows lots of people who cook brilliantly. What's even better is that many of the dishes illustrate the return to long cooking techniques, using less-expensive meats.  This is right up my alley -- I'm a braisen' fool -- and so far, I've been happy with everything I've made.  One caveat: Wells is no wine expert.  Approach her wine pairing recommendations with caution 
 Anyone with money invested in the market, especially in real estate, would benefit from reading this book. It's hard to believe just how out-of-hand the situation really has become in many areas of the country, and the author explains how it got that way. He covers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, illustrating how they have amassed an enormous amount of debt to guarantee.  He goes on to explain the process of securitization, in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bundle this risky mortgage debt into bonds and then sell those bonds on the open market. As a result, a massive increase in the number of mortgages in default could have a dramatic effect on the market as a whole. Rubino presents many options which home owners can use to protect themselves when the bubble pops, including simple strategies to hedge the value of a home. He also presents several ways to possibly even profit from a major crash in the real estate market.  Whether you own a house or not, you can use these ideas and techniques to protect your current investments and find new investments 
 This isn't Huck Finn - not by a long shot.  Instead, it's a broad sample of Twain's writings the human race, a race he considers lost from the git-go. It starts with the eight Letters from Earth, a total of 40 pages or so. Twain uses the voice of an exiled angel, temporarily in terrestrial residence, to describe the utter insanity of human kind. He continues with Letters to Earth, another angelic text, this time in answer to the prayers of an uncommonly crass business man - anyone who's read Twain's War Prayer has a good idea of what to expect.  It's not all spleen and satire, though. Some of the pieces here are just satire. Repentance, the Gorky Incident, Etiquette, and others are laugh-out-loud funny, even if they have a slightly acid tang, or maybe because of it. Cooper's Prose Style and The Damned Human Race are good ones, too. I have to admit, though, The Great Dark never seemed to find its stride, and editor's note suggest that Twain may have thought the same.  If you haven't read these pieces, you haven't read Twain - well, you missed a lot. Go ahead, these short writings are well worth the effort, even after a century.  //wiredweir 
 This book is worth buying, I has a beautiful cover and is well writen, Instructions are clear and it has many close up pictures as illistration. If you love chaian mail and like a challage consider this book 
 I was a young adult when Ingrid died and I was not aware of her fame and reputation as a film star.  I saw her occasionally in old movies and was fascinated by her glowing beauty and talent.  I was appalled by her appearance in her role as Golda Meir; she had changed so much, but now I know why.  Spoto's biography about Ingrid revealed her intimately -- from her childhood to her death, throughout her marriages and affairs, the successes of her career, and relationships with friends and family.  I didn't know that she had been banned from America for her "sins", and I didn't know she had other children besides Isabella Rosselini.  In spite of her foibles, Ingrid still seems like a great woman, thanks to the passionate -- and compassionate -- telling of her life story by Spoto.  The audio version of the book was completely compelling to listen to, enhanced by the reader, C.M. Herbert, whose voice had a quality similar to Ingrid's, and therefore made Ingrid come even more to life 
 I first saw this movie on television it was one of the movies shown at the Tribeca Film Festival.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Truly loved it. 
 There were a lot of closeups of Nureyev. obviously he played a big part in the production of this video. Margot Fonteyn just kinda disappeared into the background.  Their dancing was impeccable nonetheless. The corps was lamentable, and the orchestra was utterly disappointing. Nureyev's hoggishness evident in all the focus that was put upon his performance was discouraging as well. But Margot's dancing in this particular performance was worthy of all the praise she has received in her career and after. Her performance is what really saved this dvd from being considered a flop. For Margot, 4 stars 
 Those familiar with his most famous work 'The Prince' may find this hard to believe. In this collection we see a totally different side of the man through; a humorous letter to his brother about an encounter with a less than attractive prostitute, a hilarious short story with a dubious message about marriage and a completely comic play. The nearly 500 years since their appearance does nothing to diminish their comedic value. These three pieces alone make the work worth the money. If that's not enough for you, there are also selections from his famous 'Art of War' and 'The Discourses.' True Machiavelli fans like myself will not want to miss this gem 
 Form reading the other reviews, it seems other people thought it was too bloody, but if you know anything about Klingons you know the are a VERY violent race. I didn't think this book was that bloody. I've been following  Star Trek for most of my life and this book was one of the most accurate  I've ever read. And, of course, the other accurate books were also writen  by Diane Carey 
    As many of the other E. B. White's books, Trumpet of the Swan is a insparational book where animals have feeling and take part. I would recomend this book because it is informational, yet fiction that is easy to enjoy. Louis is a young swan that was born with a speech defect. Because of that catastrophe, later in his life he is not able to call to the female swan he likes. His father and mother hate to see Louis so unhappy so his father steals him a brass trumpet and is now in debt. With his trumpet, he is able to get jobs and cover his fathers debt, but first he had to go to school. On his neck, a slate and chalk, a moneybag, a medal for saving a boy, and of course a trumpet, this bird has gone through a lot and is quite remarkable 
 The book gave me some very usefull ways to improve my meditation. I did find a need to simplify some of the longer exercises. I am using many of the concepts in my daily meditation 
 I purchased this book (it's actually a two volume set) about a year ago and it still fascinates me.  It sits underneath a glass coffee table in our living room.  When company visits, invariably, someone picks it up and starts going through it, at that point they are "no longer there".  It happens everytime, once you start, it becomes very difficult to put the book down.  You tell yourself "I'll just look at one more page" but the photos are superbly done as well as the narration. WONDERFUL 
 "Bebel Gilberto" is a worthy follow-up to "Tanto Tempo." "Tanto Tempo" had a more electric feel because of the production by the late genius Suba.  "Bebel Gilberto" is softer;yes,it's different,but doesn't make it worse.Only different.Joao Gilberto's famous daughter is doing quite well on her own terms.  Highlights- 1)Aganju-Very jazzy.No wonder it has its own single of remixes.It's quite danceable. 2)River Song-Very flowing. 3)Cada Beijo-Bebel is best when she sings in Portuguese.Portuguese is a musical language. 4)O Caminho-Another great Portuguese song. 5)Ceu Distante-Very good. 6)Jabuticaba-Bouncy&frothy.This was recently featured on Putumayo's World Music Hour.No wonder.It's catchy.  Bebel Gilberto does great again!I'm glad I got this 
           I am still reading the how to self publish section.  I am a complete novice writer attempting to write a first non-fiction book.  The book has opened my eyes to the pitfalls and made me aware of many details I would otherwise miss.  Marketing being one of the details I needed to be more aware of.           I recommend the book highly 
 I think that every Christian in America should watch this film.  This documentary focuses on what every Christian wants to ignor about God and the bible.  
 I couldn't find them at my local store any more, so I had to order them on line.  
 November 22, 1963 was a day that all who were alive that day will remember. It was the day J.F. Kennedy was killed. But in the shadow of that famous death two other great men died that day, Aldous Huxley and John F. Kennedy. This book deals with those three famous men and a fictional dialog they would have sometime after life, but before a final judgment.  These three great men each believed in an afterlife but differently. Lewis in ancient western theism, Kennedy was a humanist, and Huxley believed in ancient eastern pantheism. Each also believed or practiced different forms of Christianity. Lewis was more mainline orthodox Christianity, Kennedy was a modernist or humanistic Christianity and Huxley an Orientalized or mystical Christianity.  The three men meet in a white mist or fog, they debate where they are, what they believe and where they think they will end up. Like many of Kreeft's books it is written as a dialogue, a conversation in three parts. They each present their world views, their view of the afterlife and their understanding of what their life meant. Yet each is open to the `truth' what truth really is and if it has eternal impact.  This is one of those fun light reads, written in a unique and engaging manner that will presenting the three most common views currently accepted in Christianity, and three of the common interpretations of Christianity in today's world. If you want to understand other streams of Christianity or the Christians around you this book will give you a clear, concise and humorous presentation of the three main approaches today 
 Some one very special gave this as a present to me at a time when nothing else could have made me understand the way that this book did, that theres no such place as far away. Such a simple read yet so meaningful... id recommend to everyone whose apprehensive about the unknown. 
 My introduction to Aldo Leopold's words, reverberating within the covers of A Sand County Almanac, was at the age   of 5 on the earthy beat of my mother's voice.  The message, though above my 5-years ability to comprehend, tolled   deep within. To this day I can still recall the imagery flowing across my imaginary stage as mom read the recounting   of Leopolds perceptive observations.  Even though at 5 I'd never seen a wild goose, deer or turkey in my home   woods; and had never heard anyone talk of them there; I knew with a ferver, that they could be in my woods: they   should be in my home woods.  I knew I would look for them there as well.   My first 'personal read' of A Sand County Almanac, was from that same book, checked out from the Library where my   mom worked. Even though I'd heard the words several times before, each page was a new adventure. But much more   than the adventure I felt when reading the adventure stories I'd read from time-to-time on the 'kids' shelves'.  This   adventure was happening in a very real world; my world.  That adventure went with me every day as I shuffled among   the leaves, branches, rocks and soil in my home woods; as I stealthly searched under rocks, in the riffles and holes of   my home waters.   Though I read of Leopold's observations in Wisconsin, Arizona, Illinois, Missouri and other places, I saw each of them   in my home woods; along the banks of my home creek; among the fields of my home wanderings.    Leopold's words did not become my words ... no, they inspired my innermost heartbeat to rise to the surface where   in time I developed my own 'home words'.  Those are the same words that guide me to this very day.   This book is much more than a collection of words from a wise man. A Sand County Almanac is an inspired text.   Inspired by a time far removed from where our society stands today.  Written by a man with a clear-eyed vision of   the future; from wisdom, born of knowledge and understanding on how to attain a better future; above the usual   human frailty.  All said, in simple, clear, humble tones that beckon you to listen; to learn; to understand; to wisely   apply: to pass on.  Leopold was a scientiest with a wonderous command for the ability to put his thoughts in the more   peaceable tones ... even when those words are meant as stern, hard-hitting corrections.   In essence, A Sand County Almanac is one of those rare pieces of literature that promotes the finest form of   sustainability: natural wisdom.     A Sand County Almanac is a must read for all people; of all ages; for all times.  It is timeless and so is our human need to   hear it's timeless message.  Read it often. Read it to others. Pass on the wisdom found within its pages.     Leopold would be the first to tell you, the book is not about him; it's far more important than a mere man.  The book is   about peaceful coexistence with ourselves and all that encompasses life on this magnificent planet. A Sand County   Almanac is a guidebook to attaining a balanced life ... with all life, on earth 
 Although it has roots in pop, folk, country and rock, "Despite Our Differences" is completely free of the pretention, posturing and empty sloganeering that usually fatally flaws those genres. Musically and lyrically honest, and incredibly resonant, this collection of songs is hook-filled and catchier than I ever thought possible. Hard to believe these ladies have been at it for the better part of twenty years and are still capable of writing such great songs. A mixture of full band arrangements and spare acoustics that are absolutely impeccably produced, this cd just plain SOUNDS good, with nothing added to the mix that doesn't belong. This is the antithesis of ( and the perfect antidote to ) prefab teen pop, precocious ( and pretentious ) art-rock and empty, bravado-filled rap. Standout tracks include "Little Perennials" ( thank you, Miss Ray, for giving me my newest favourite should-have-been-a-hit single ), "Money Made You Mean" ( which is even better in the live version featured on the bonus disc ), "Run",the gorgeous ballad "Fly Away" and the urgent, angry "Rock and Roll Heaven's Gate."  This is the kind of pop album REM used to make before they disappeared up their own arses, that Let's Active made before they disappeared completely and that most of the new wave of young, sensitive singer-songwriters ( Mayer, Jones, Branch, et al ) only wish they could make. If ever an album was truly deserving of heaps of praise, this is it. Richly rewarding and very highly recommended 
 Well, I bought the book, because I am named after the book. But in reading it I was shocked that a book from 1949, could be such a current day romance novel. I was shocked that a book written at that time contained floozys. The book was well written and I am sure it will always be a classic novel. If you love romance novels, this book is the perfect book for you 
 Poor Bart, the Bear at the end! T.V. Prints have pretty good editing so they are suitable for kids. One of Aykroyd and Candy's best 
 As someone who volunteers with teen girls on a regular basis, and hears them obsess about their bodies, "All Made Up" is a breath of fresh air. My favorite aspect of this book is how it helps girls deal with boys who think that all girls should look like pop stars and models --  my favorite chapter. It reminds young women that they're wonderful just as they are, yet "All Made Up" is not  condescending or preachy. It's obvious the author knows what she's talking about; she constantly pulls examples from her days as a teen model, and her experience as a teen magazine editor. I only wish this book existed when I was a teen 
 I happened upon this disc after becoming re-acquainted with shape note singing via the recently released "Cold Mountain" soundtrack. Wow. There is something thrilling, something visceral and yet greater than oneself, that is provoked upon listening to this wonderful and strange music. This is definitely not the Boston Camerata, so please don't buy it hoping to hear something glossy, high-church and perfectly executed. This is simply rousing, foot-stopping spiritual music sung by real god-fearing folk. Something in this music evoked a certain Proustian nostalgia in this Appalachian woman, reminding me of attending church with my elderly aunt at the tiny Baptist church in Cyrus, West Virginia as a small child--a church so small that the minister was a circuit preacher who rotated between several congregations. That congregation had something of the enthusiasm rendered on this disc-- I listened with tears streaming down my face. I highly reccommend this recording to anyone interested in musical ethnography, or in simply hearing the word of God sung with full-out enthusiasm and joy 
 Beautiful. Kushner attacks many of the world's carnal attitudes and inputs thoughts and principles that help combat them. Though he is not Christian, this book is full of principles that help you avoid being conformed to this world and be transformed by the renewing of your mind 
 I first heard about Course of Nature when a friend of mine recommended Wall of Shame. I then acquired their debut album Superkala in 2002. Three or four years later, it's still one of my favorite cds. The songs range from rough hard dock (Wall of Shame) to soft, violin accompanied ballads (Caught in the Sun) to the jazzy After the Fall.  Caught of Nature is:  Mark Wilkerson -- Lead vocals, rhythm guitar.  Fish -- Lead guitar, bass.  Ricky Shelton -- Drums, backup vocals.   The album features ten solid rock songs, but there are some standouts. Caught in the Sun is a magnificient track, Difference of Opinion, Someone Else to You, and Better Part of Me are absolutely stellar tracks.  Wilkerson is not an exceptional singer, although he's very good. Fish is an excellent guitarist, and, accompanied with Wilkerson's solid rhythm guitar, produce a great sound. Shelton is a respectable drummer, although the drums are usually drowned out by the guitar. One of the great strengths of this group is the song writing. Songs such as Better Part of Me and Caught in the Sun are beautifully written.  I have one complaint about the album though. With only ten tracks, it comes in at a short (approx.) 46 minutes. Hopefully, if there's a followup album, it will be just as solid of a record but feature a few more tracks. They've had three years, so if they are producing another album, I'm expecting alot out of it 
 Book arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Gave as a gift.  They are suing and getting good info from it 
 This is a nice story about an artist and his relationships with friends, his daughters, old colleagues and grandson after WWII has ended. It is an interesting insight into the mind of someone who was active politicially in imperial Japan who then had to look back on his actions objectively and make apologies for it post war.   The characters are interesting and realistically complex and their interactions are very authentic in how Japanese people relate to each other within and outside of the family.   Anyone living in Japan or who is interested in relating to Japanese people would benefit from the insights gained by reading this book. Having said that, even if you don't have any connection to Japan or Japanese people, I think one of the main themes of personal forgiveness can speak to you on another level as well as many of us are conflicted about things we have done in the past and how to move on with our lives once it has become clear that we had made bad choices 
 THIS ALBUM KICKS A*S, if you can't handle Angus Young in your face with amazing guitar solos then your p*ssy a*s needs too find music like Garth Brooks S*IT! 
 One of the best new authors to date, and possibly one of the best writers in the history of the English language! Jasper has a VERY firm grasp of the language and creates a..slightly...twisted version of reality where people jump into books, fictional characters jaunt around the real world (Hamlet) and books have a tendancy to re-write themselves. Characters include Jane Eyre (of course), the Cheshire cat, The Red Queen, Hamlet, and a slew of minor personalities from books out of print (for good reasons). If you like puns, you'll LOVE this series

 The book provides insightful information and nuanced analysis that is written beautifully. This is certainly an insider's viewpoint - he is probably Bob Woodward of Pakistan. One may disagree with some of the conclusions of the book about the prospects of Talibanization of Pakistan but there is no doubt the work is authoritative and convincing in its approach. It's a must read for students of South Asian history and for those who want to learn about roots of Islamic radicalism in the region. Profiles of Pakistani extremist groups are very detailed and based on info that I believe is not available elsewhere.  The writer is clearly sympathetic towards minority Muslim groups in Pakistan especially Ahmedis and Shias but provides specific and credible instances of crimes committed against these communities. Also explains how Blasphemy laws are biased against Christian minority. He also severely criticizes Pakistan army for its interference in politics and intelligence agencies for how they groomed and sponsored terrorist groups. In comparison he has been somewhat soft on Pakistani police which he remains associated with as per his bio in the book.  The best part of the book is about General Musharraf and how he is handling Pakistan and the war on terror - he has mixed opinion about Musharraf's capability to make a real difference in the long run. He argues that moderate political parties and revival of real democracy is the only way things can be improved.  Final remark - its an academic book I believe but is written like a thriller - its difficult to put it down once you start reading. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know how Pakistan is progressing (or digressing) and how intriguing is the history of Pakistan-US relations. 
 Well, if you're looking for a book which explains with simple words the world of freelance illustrators, with tricks and tips, examples, wisdom and a bit of jokes, you've found it! And it's fine also for other similar careers. I definitely can suggest it 
 Let me start by stating clearly that this is not a book of home remedies for children's illnesses.  If that's what you're looking for, you will be disappointed with this book.  If, however, you are looking for a book to tell you whether a certain set of symptoms requires no treatment, a morning call to the doctor or a midnight trip to the hospital, you won't be disappointed.  This basic format of the book is simple.  For each condition (say, spitting up), there is a page or so of general information.  Then, there's a chart of possible symptoms (ie, Does your child spit up excessively when played with after nursing?), what the cause could be (ie, If yes, the cause could be overstimulation) and what kind of action should be taken (ie, let the baby rest quietly after nursing).  Basically, I think of this as my "Should I worry?" book.  When I'm not sure whether I need to call the doctor or not, I pull out this reference and find out.  A definite "must" for the bookshelf of any parent.  Incidentally, this book comes in both hardcover and softcover.  Based on some reviews that complained about the small typeface in the softcover, I bought a used hardcover in perfect condition for less than what was being charged for the softcover version - there seem to be a lot of hardcovers for sale in good condition pretty cheaply through Amazon, so I'd check that out before buying a softcover 
 Bernard Lewis is an expert on Turkish/Ottoman history. The background of turkish history lies in the Ottoman empire and beginning from 1800 all the bases of ideas that Turkish Republic is based on flourished and evolved in Istanbul and in European cities. Since in Turkey I have learnt "propagandist" history and one-man show of Ataturk I have increased my perspective on Turkish history with this book. Lacking are what happened to minorities of Anatolia and the harshness of realities about that them. Anatolia was their land too. Their story has not been told 
 Technical people are always looking for ways that technology can improve and enrich their lives.  Smart homes-or home automation-has always seemed like something more from science fiction than science fact.  However, after reading this book, the truth is that creating a smart home is easier and far less technical than most people think.  This book provides the reader with 100 tips or things that can be done (some quite easy, some might take longer to complete) to automate your home.  Contrary to what you might think, much of what you can do with home automation doesn't require your home to be re-wired.  Instead, much of what you might want to accomplish (like having your computer automatically turning on or off lights in the house while you're on vacation) can be done very easily through X10 modules.  X10 modules are relatively inexpensive components which can send signals over power lines.  Once you understand X10, many of the more straightforward hacks in this book make a lot of sense.  Other projects you'll find in this book include a home monitoring system, a smart sprinkling system, sending messages of what's happening at home to a cell phone or pager, and even controlling your home from a web browser.  While some of these projects may sound a bit Orwellian, they are actually very interesting and can make your home a safer place to live.  Instead of becoming a victim when a toilet or washing machine overflows, you can put preemptive measures in place to be alerted before a problem occurs.  This is a very interesting book and a must read if you've ever considered home automation.  Not only will this book step you through some projects, but it will give you some excellent ideas for the future.  I enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it. 
 THis was a great love story. There was never any pretensions between the two characters. The mysteries surrounding them never came between their love and Caroline was bright, spunky, optimistic and full of life. She was exactly what NOrth needed. USually romance books can be so irritating because of all the "oh let me hide my love because I dont want to be hurt" drama. However here we have two normal people who gradually come to care about one another and there is no hoopla just honest sentiment. It's a great read and you dont need to have read THe Wyndham Legacy in order to understand this one since it can stand on its own. Have fun 
 I find myself nearly unable to read most romance novels, because the characters are just too predictable, and the writing style unoriginal.  But this romantic tale was a pleasant surprise.  I enjoyed the leisurely (but not boring) pace, the setting (early 1800's London) and especially the characters.  Please do not be put off by the ridiculously absurd cover art, because inside lies an enjoyable story about two people who love one another 
 with so many choices of books regarding alternative medicine i was praying i made the right one when purchasing this one.  I was convinced that i had when i looked up my first medical problem; and written in layman terms too.  this book will be invaluable to me over and over; and makes for informative reading even if you're a picture of health 
 LAURA starring Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, amd Clifton Webb, directed by Otto Preminger, shines as a dusky jewel among les films-noirs. Tierney is never so beautiful and unattainable as in this movie, especially to the men who love her. She is an appealing and wholesome girl with a quick mind, exquisite taste, and a glamorous lifestyle. Unfortunately, Laura is not a wise judge of character, which explains why she has so many "characters" in her life. The screenplay is clever, witty and flowing and all the performances are superb. This is a film worth having since it needs to be watched more than once to absorb the naunces 
 "The Way of the World" is a true masterpiece of wit and social commentary. It anticipates later works by such masters of dialogue as Oscar Wilde. I read this play in a course on restoration and 18th century drama that I took in graduate school and it was by far among my favorite plays that semester. Those who complain that it is too complex (and then contradict themselves by calling it a mere soap opera) clearly do not appreciate the subtlety and multiple layers of Congreve's genius. While yes, some characters are one dimensional, the main characters are multi-layered and complex. Case in point - Mirabel, the male protagonist, clearly loves Millamant but has mercenary ambitions as well. He also has an implied rakish past, which led to the extremely unhappy marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Fainall (though he endeavors to come to Mrs. Fainall's aid during the course of the play). Certainly many of the characters are stereotypes, but that in itself is interesting and highly comical. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant, among the best I've seen. I highly recommend giving this play the time and attention it deserves - "The Way of the World" is highly rewarding entertainment. 
 Any reader of military history who wishes to follow the evolution of modern Soviet fighters must look at Soviet Secret Projects: Fighters Since 1945. It provides a powerful military aviation history of the achieved and proposed projects, including designs unknown to the West, and drafted as possible prototypes which never got off the ground. These projects were created by the former Union between 1945 to present and offer not only black and white photos and sketches of projects, but background history into the competition between projects.

 It has been awhile since I read this book, but I remember it being an enjoyable read.  
 We like to incorporate back exercise in our workout routine, and after trying out a friend's inversion table, we decided to get one for our home gym. After considering various brands, we settled on the Teeter Hang Ups, convinced by their ad showing extensive stress and strength testing. If you are hanging by your ankles upside down, you want the best inversion table there is, no doubt about it.   Why Invert  The reason to use an inversion table is to stretch your spine. Normally, you stand and your legs and pelvis and stomach support the spine. When you sit, you increase the pressure on the spine by resting on your coccyx (tailbone). So for people who sit all day, inversion can actually act like traction, using gravity to pull the vertebrae and decompress the spine.   As you hang or lean at various angles from 20 degrees to 90 degrees -- totally upside down, your head gets more blood, your stomach muscles lengthen and stretch and your shoulders relax because you put your arms fully over your head.   You can gradually build up your angle from 20 degrees, allowing you to adjust to the new feeling in your head and spine. You can use the table to do rocking (down to your set angle, back up to level or vertical) or you can do intermittent traction (1-2 minutes down, 1/2 minute up.) In the fully suspended 90 degree position, your body is literally hanging by your ankles and you can do twists, sit-ups, squats and back arches. This is not possible in the shallower angle positions as you are lying on the table in those positions as opposed to freely hanging with spine straight.   You may not use any bands, weights or other equipment while on the table. You MUST wear tie shoes with flat, even soles (no thick soles, no high tops.) A standard pair of trainers (running or walking shoes) with ties works just fine.    What you get  The table is a flat, nylon bed resting on a steel A-frame. The bed rotates like a teeter-totter. There is an ankle clamp on the bottom to hold your feet securely, and a pin lock height adjustment to set the table to the right height for you, which may be 1 or 2 inches above or below your actual height, depending on your center of gravity. There are handles (extended or normal) for the arms. There is an "anti-rattle" adjustment screw to prevent unwanted shimmy.   The table is not powered; you operate it with your body weight, using your arms to add upper body weight to take you down to your desired position.   The unit is based on an A-frame that collapses for folding and storage, the hinges lock (like on a folding table) and there are clips on the base to stabilize the base on the floor. The 5000 has optional "over-easy" extension arms, longer arm pieces that allow the user to move their hands and arms up and down to move to inverted more easily. Mine were included in a promo.   A safety strap can be used to limit inversion to set degrees such as 20, 40 or 60 degrees. The table will automatically stop and the maximum degree you set and prevent you from inverting more than is comfortable for you.   When starting out, have a friend to stay with you in case of dizziness or other discomfort.   The Teeter Hang Ups comes with a 90 page book (Better Body) on inversion (ours turned up missing and we had to call customer service) and a 14 minute video on set up, safety and recommended use. This is a must-watch. If you do not have a way to play a DVD, you should find some way to do so as the information is vital to adjusting the table to your height and the safety information tells you how to secure your ankles against falls which, head-down, are very dangerous. Needless to say, children should be monitored closely while using the inversion table.   The unit also comes with a laminated use guide that clips to the table with a chain. This is a nice touch, and important, as safe usage is paramount when inverting.   The table weighs 62 pounds and measures 45 inches x 28 inches x 58 inches. The maximum height for any user is 6'6", the minimum is 4'8". Maximum weight: 300 pounds.    There are accessories available such as gravity boots that allow full inversion to be more comfortable on the ankles. The standard ankle clamp is a soft rubber cup in back of the ankle, with a pin-lock rubber padded bar for the top of the instep. When locked into the clamp, your foot is secured above the ankle bone by firm pressure. It seems you have to add a t-bar to use the gravity boots. The boots also afford a gentler angle to the joints, so if you have joint problems and find the ankle clamp uncomfortable, you might want to spring for the extra $100 it costs to upgrade to the boots.   Assembly was just a few pieces, it took longer, actually, to watch the DVD.   We don't bother to fold it up, because it's in our basement gym, but it would fit in the corner of a master bedroom and if you lived in a small apartment, it can be folded for under-bed or against a wall.   How does it feel?  I am SO happy with my table. While I normally don't like to be upside down, I love the feeling of stretching my spine while I hang downwards. I have not achieved the 90 degree setting yet but I am confident I will do so. I use the table first thing in the morning to stretch after sleeping and it makes me stand up, after I get off, like I had a ballet workout; stomach relaxed, shoulders down, chest out and relaxed. Five minutes literally feels like I had an hour nap, so I do this when I come home or at lunchtime (BEFORE EATING) if I am working at home. I don't do it after I eat. I never do it with a full stomach, right after eating.   I do the intermittent traction most of the time. When I get up to the full inversion at 90 degrees, I plan to try some of those crunches, which are said to be equivalent to 10 regular crunches.

 How come some people choose to be part of bizarre subcultures, where goths, witches, Satanists, BDSM-fans, vampires, and other strange individuals dwell? Well, some do it just to piss of their parents, others have seen a video with Evanescence or Good Charlotte on TV and decide to head to the nearest Hot Topic, some do it because the others do it, perhaps to some it's part of their growing up, and some do it just because they feel for the moment to do something different.  But then there are some who do since they instinctively feel they HAVE to do it, that the shadow side of life offers more pleasure than the "traditional" side, and that there is now way they'll feel complete without their certain clothes, makeup, rings and bracelets, their nocturnal visits to the local cemetery, or the hours spent on the dance floor of a nearby gothic nightclub. They're dark individuals, they're fascinated by things the majority of people fear, but they're not evil. They're just different. And often misunderstood.  Author Corvis Nocturnum is one of these dark, often misunderstood people. Throughout his life he had to suffer humiliation from his strange way of dress and harassment due to his morbid and different opinions. He knew there were others like him, and obviously he appreciated the ones he'd found, but he still wanted to something more concrete; explain to people how the nocturnal creatures who shun the sun, find death and morbid matters fascinating, and in other ways choose to go their own ways were people; perhaps different and weird, but still people.  And so he wrote a book about it, a book subtitled "Understanding Dark Subcultures", and that's exactly what it's all about: an introduction for "normal" people who want to understand alternative lifestyles. If you happen to belong to any of the groups that Corvis describe, then the book offers very little new information; Satanists know who LaVey was and they've heard of the First Church of Satan before, goths know perfectly well what makes them goth, witches know what witches want, fetish people have encountered bondage and flogging before, and so on.  Well, does this mean the book is pointless and not worth buying in case you already belong to one of the dark subcultures? Yes. And no. Or rather, sort of. You might not learn anything new, but it's still very nice to read a book written by an insider, an author with many years of experience of what he's writing about, and who in a relaxed and very human way tells the world what he (and the interviewed individuals) thinks.  It's not a book written by a scholar. If you want one of those you'll be disappointed, the proof-reading is not very good, and some of the interviews feel somewhat redundant. However, most persons featured in the book are both interesting and have important things to say, and in between the interviews all sorts of different aspects are brought up and described, descriptions that are followed by representatives for that particular topic. In the end you'll find a useful, but rather short, list of recommended reading and websites, which can be very valuable to anyone wanting to learn more of what Corvis talks about.  So now, it is worth buying? You bet. Embracing the Darkness is a different book about different people, not a scholarly masterpiece, yet still a great initiative that without a doubt should be supported. Go get it 
 This magazine is often said to be intended for graphic design newbies. While it is true that if you are inexperienced to graphic design principles and software, this is the magazine for you --it is also true that pros can get a lot of useful ideas from Dynamic Graphics.  As an experienced designer, it sometimes helps me to re-visit basic techniques, color use, schemes and read reviews of new design software just hitting the market (they aren't ALL good). Even graphics pros get 'design blocked' from time-to-time.  I get something useful out of every issue, and the free downloadable stuff on DG's website is a nice treat too 
 No one goes after the "bad guys" like Michael Moore. He is relentless asking big business why not take care of the working man who put you where you are today?  He asks the simple question, why not share the wealth?  He pursues the answers to these questions in a humorous and compassionate manner. Being a working woman myself, and working in the auto industry, I appreciate where this documentary comes from 
      Owen King's first book is a prime example of a young author showing a voice and vision well beyond his years.  In the novella from which the book adopts its name, Owen uses language to create a vivid picture of the characters beliefs and mores while keeping the story both light (with humor based both in observation and dialogue) while still providing ultimate heft to make the characters and their world as real as the people you've met on your block, and/or the people you wished lived on your block.        The accompanying stories show a range both dazzling and hopeful for the books that are sure to come (and, end up on all of our bookshelves) in the next decade plus.        All in all, everyone should buy this book now!...if you enjoy intelligent observation, real characters (w/ flaws, quirks, and redemptions) and an easy going style that sneeks up and bites you in the neck after seducing your mind...with commentary on who we are and who we could be.  Owen King's writing will insinuate into your heart and mind and nestle up against the things you know to be true but might not be ready to admit.  He makes us learn the truth from ourselves, about ourselves...the mark of any great writing.  BUY THIS BOOK!    
 I think the book was well written and I liked the author's writing style. Its a little outdated though. I would like to see an updated edition with more data on the newer anti herpes drugs such as Valtrex. Its been 5 years, so its time to get some newer information out there 
 I read the book, and responded to the story in a manner that might be deemed "unmanly" by some.  I saw the movie, and the water-works began all over again.  There is much here, mostly things that are in gravely short supply.  A sense of purpose, and sense of there being a meaning that's too big to see.  And Hope.  Not being a very worldly fellow, I believe it may be said that the message in this story cuts through every boundary it might encounter.  I feel badly for anyone cursed with enough cynicism to blind them to the simple beauty of this story.  Literary and movie critics should take the day off where this one is concerned ... it can stand very well on it's own, even without the fanfare and hoopla that accompanys the mythic Block Buster.  It sort of reminds me a little bit of "Something Wicked This Way Comes 
 This is a good, basic collection of stories; you'll be surprised how entertaining they can be!  Enjoy 
 Having just begun an art history course, I am happy to have been introduced to Erwin Panofsky.  This book is wonderful for experts and beginners alike, as it does not assume the reader has any foreknowledge of iconography, but it does not bore the reader who does.  The imagery in this book is beautiful, and brings to life painting that may otherwise seem from another time.  Wonderful examples throughout.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the underlying symbolism in art 
 I have this book for myself, signed by Senator McCain and I enjoy it so much I wanted to share it. I bought one for all my friends with families, young and old. Everyone loved it! I am really excited that I found it. It's a great gift for anyone. Highly recommended to everyone 
  Cy Young was a great book. I learned a lot of baseball history. Thanks for writing this book Reed Browning 
 I love my Asics GT-2120.  What a difference it makes to have the right shoes to run, no more knee pain.  I actually went to a local store and had a running test done and tried on different shoes and this were the best.  Great arch support 
 When Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa), a popular horror novelist visits Rome to promote his latest best-seller "Tenebrae", he is suddenly thrust into a world of murder and mayhem when a psychopath goes on a killing spree and uses techniques described in his book. The killer seems to be on a mission, killing off people (mostly women) who are morally corrupt and are referred to by the killer as "deviants".   This blood-soaked, fast-moving Argento flick is not in the same classic level as his masterpiece "Suspiria" or even "Deep Red" but his fans seem to love it regardless. The film is not really a horror film but a sexually charged detective thriller with an attractive cast, solid acting (although some of the dubbing is pretty annoying), creative camera angles (typical in an Argento film) and lot's of blood (again, typical of an Argento film). Like Argento's other work, this film is visually stunning. The entire cast is made up of photogenic, elegant actors; Daria Nicolodi, Mirella D'Angelo, Anthony Franciosa, John Saxon, Ania Pieroni and a whole array of exotic European beauties. Argento also uses the color red effectively throughout this film; bright red lipstick, red stilettos, red cars, countless scenes of gleaming red blood. It takes someone like Dario Argento to make blood look so beautiful on screen.   This film was released in North America in a heavily edited form and under the insane title of "Unsane".  I've never seen the edited version but apparently many scenes were cut in order for the film to get an "R" rating. "Tenebrae" may be violent but the violence itself is no more shocking then the numerous slasher films released from Hollywood throughout the decade so it's a mystery to me as to why this film was given this kind of treatment. It's a shame because not many people have been able to see this in its unedited form until it's DVD release.   "Tenebrae" boasts a strong cast, a great score (maybe a bit outdated but it's awesome nonetheless), a good story, and a great "twist" finale. Like Dario's other film's; "Deep Red", "Opera", "Phenomena", "Inferno" and the enigmatic "Suspiria", "Tenebrae" is eerily suspenseful, looks splendid and is a worthy addition to anyone's DVD collection. Unless of course, watching beautiful women get the "axe" by a homicidal maniac isn't exactly your cup of tea.    Highly recommended.    
 Other than r-type for SNES, I've never really played muuch else in terms of the series. However, I'm glad to say that I purchased this one for PS2. Graphics and control aside, I think it's the game mechanics which make this such a fun game. The basics from the original are essentially the same; you fly a ship around, blastng your way through hordes of enemies in an endless assault of lasers and obstacles. However, what set this baby apart from the rest is your weapon system. You have an attachable bit on the front of your ship which can be released, allowing you to place it on the front or back of your ship, or just let it roam about. This means you can fire behind you.Pretty cool. Plus, the bit itself absorbs most bullets, so it can be used as a shield, which after absorbing enough energy, allows you to unleash a large explosing-type shot. Coupled with charged shots, customizable bits and missiles, there's a lot of room for technique. Plus, there are 101 different ships you can you use, each with their own weapons systems and bit and missile selections (which can be surprisingly unique) so you won't run into problems of redundancy. Other than the difficulty and sometimes slow pacing of the game, (not to mention the slow-down issue at times)this is a must buy for all shooter fans. highly recommended 
 Really.  It's a great book.  You should buy it.   You'll really like it.  I promise.  Unless you don't like informative books about writing and are not Stephen King fan.  Then you probably won't like this book.  But then why are you looking at this page?    I think you truly do like Stephen King and you will like this book.  
 Each Angela Johnson book gets harder and harder to review.  When Ms. Johnson produces yet another slim title about a kid dealing with an extraordinary yet everyday problem, I shiver.  Not because Ms. Johnson is a bad writer, mind you.  Just a funny one.  You can't pin down an Angela Johnson book with a single sentence.  You can't explain what it is that she's doing with her writing without reaching into the complicated issues that she's discussing.  Her first few books were fairly easy to understand.  Nowadays they're all published as perfect little entities that exist entirely in their own world with or without your participation in them.  "Bird", one of the most recent, is more difficult to love than Ms. Johnson's crowd pleasers like "First Part Last".  Telling three different stories from three different perspectives, Johnson spreads herself a little too thin in her tale of a girl looking for a father-figure, a boy learning to use his new heart, and another boy finding a way to come to terms with his brother's death.  Chipper stuff. 	 Bird loved her stepfather Cecil.  He wasn't a particularly reliable man and he wasn't always a nice man, but he was the only daddy Bird had ever known.  Now he's taken off in the middle of the night without a word and the girl can't take it.  Pooling her resources, she heads down South to find Cecil and convince him to return home with her in the North.  She camps out in an old abandoned shed near a cheery family's farmhouse and survives by eating their leftover breakfasts and bathing in their beautiful white bathtub.  The family includes Ethan, a kid who until recently was confined to a hospital bed.  He's just been given a new heart and in Bird he sees someone who can definitely be his first friend.  Trouble is, his heart came from Jay's brother.  Jay moved to town relatively recently, and he's been placed under house arrest for joyriding in a neighbor's truck without permission or a license.  Between the two boys, Bird becomes a gentle visitor who helps them with their problems but also has her own daddy issues to contend with. 	 "Bird" is a lovely book.  Don't get me wrong.  But if you've a kid who likes their plots neatly wrapped up by the story's close, don't hand them this one.  I got to the end of this tale and found myself staring with utter incomprehension at Angela Johnson's biography (appearing just after the last page) rather than the conclusion I'd been anticipating.  I just couldn't figure it out.  Sure, we get a very clear sense of what happens to Bird by the end.  But Ethan and Jay's tales are wrapped up with such a tender touch that you're left feeling just a little bit robbed.  Johnson uses the minimum amount of words to convey her stories.  There's not a sentence out of place or a word that could be used better in her books.  Here, however, instead of feeling that she's filled you up with a work of perfect simplicity, you're hungering for more.  You want more details and explanations.  You want, for example, to know what these people look like.  I never really noticed it before, but when a children's work of fiction talks about two boys of relatively the same age and doesn't describe so much as the shade of their hair, I start seeing them in my mind's eye as the same boy.  Maybe one's a little taller than the other, but that's it.  That's the difference.  Ms. Johnson should have paid more attention to the rudimentary details of her book rather than the lofty ideas that are conveyed in the least amount of words. 	 A bit harsh, aren't I?  I'm sorry.  It really is a nice book.  In many ways the portions of it that talking about running (as exercise) reminded me of Sharon Creech's, "Heartbeat".  I couldn't actually see kids sitting down and reading, "Bird" for pleasure.  If they did they'd find a wonderful little story about what it means to count on someone and how we are affected (and react) to grief.  For those Angela Johnson fans out there, this will be just yet another great venture by a woman that can seriously be regarded as a children's literature veteran.  A perfectly good book that is probably a little more ambitious than it can justify being. 
 Margaret Tuttle lives a life filled with secrets. She guards her secrets well, even from the man she married. And then her life changes drastically when an elfin woman appears alongside her, to ease her burdens and show her the way to a much fuller life.   Birdie Freeman is open and kind. She seems to not have a care in the world as she extends the hand of friendship to those around her. Margaret discovers that Birdie has secrets so deep, they could have torn the fabric of Birdie's life apart.   Birdie's offering is that of unconditional love. As Margaret's heart begins to trust and hope once again, suffering descends. Will Margaret be strong enough to withstand the latest attack? Will love heal even in the midst of suffering?   Armchair Interviews says: Author Jane Langston Turner's writing style is unique. Take the challenge; delve into lessons of faith and friendship.         
 Security is a large and powerful feature of .NET, but it has largely been ignored in the .NET documentation and in the books written on .NET. Mr. Mueller's book is a welcome explanation of the ins and outs of this important topic. You'll learn how to accomplish what you want to do--thanks to the author's in-depth research, clear writing, and thorough coverage of this increasingly key topic. As a bonus, the book is just plain interesting as well. Don't hesitate to buy this one! It's a real gem 
 This first edition is probably not where you want to invest your dollars.  The second edition (ISBN 0596100469 )  is projected to be out this month (July 2006) and will cover not only 2.4 but 2.5.   Martelli has been so comprehensive and comprehensible in the past, that you'll probably want to get his SECOND edition if you're serious about Python 
 This is a true McCullough masterpiece. Written in his usual flowing prose, he recounts the events leading up to possibly the most catastrophic natural disaster to date in American history.   On May 31, 1889 the dam at the South Fork fishing and hunting club burst following torrential rains of some 6-8 inches. His vivid description of the aftermath, death and suffering is chilling. He provides recounts of several individual and family experiences that are touching to say the least.   The events leading up to the disaster are vividly delineated as well. The South Fork fishing and hunting club was established by a small group of super-elite Americans (e.g. Carnegie). The club was situated up the valley from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The dam that held the lake fished by the elite suffered the brunt of much scrutiny in the years preceding the disaster. Many argued that it's poor design and integrity made it vulnerable to giving way in the event of heavy rains. The dam bursting was talked about for years preceding the event. Many joked about it, but most thought such a calamitous event to be highly unlikely.  Following a late Spring holiday parade in 1889, the "impossible" occured. The dam gave way, and the lake entered the valley, sweeping locomotives, train tracks, woods, houses, stores along with it. Entire small communities were enveloped by the heap of muck and debris on the way to Johnstown. The death toll was some 2200. McCullough paints vivid pictures of the event itself as well as the suffering in the aftermath. The corpses and muck posed and immense public health threat, with a typhoid outbreak following the disaster.   The blame was quickly placed on the elite members of the South Fork fishing and hunting club for neglecting upkeep on the dam that held their precious little weekend and holiday reserve. It's a tale of early conspicuous consumption, and disturbing to find that the wealthy members of the club refused to take blame for anything.  Along the way, McCullough provides historical detail of the industrial revolution in its beginnings. The development steel mills, railroads, refineries, labor conditions, and business dealings of the financially elite are all intertwined in his recount of Johnstown.  Also, details of death counts at the make shift morgues, financial support during the aftermath (President Harrison sent a personal check in the amount of $300.00) and a list of the names of the dead bring the story to life for the reader. Eerie recounts of coroners' descriptions of corpses in their logs will make your skin crawl.  Clara Barton began organizing the American Red Cross in 1881. She had worked on more minor floods in the valley prior to 1889. Her work at Johnstown earned her dinner with the President Harrison in Washington following her five months of pure dedication in Johnstown.  This is a fantastic book. The Katrina disaster sparked my interest and I was not disappointed. If only Clara Barton were head of the Red Cross during the Katrina aftermath.. 
 As a new immigrant, I use this book to improve my English by reading a metaphor each day 
 I have to echo the thoughts of the other reviewers:  This is a fine album, but it needs to be expanded and re-released with the rest of the material from the '69 tour.  The standard setlist for this tour also included Prodigal Son, You've Got to Move, Under My Thumb, Satisfaction, and occasionally I'm Free and Gimme Shelter.  The tapes should still exist, and if they've been lost the material is available on a number of "unauthorized" recordings that could be cleaned up.  As those recordings demonstrate, all this material would fit comfortably on one CD.  If they'd like to make this a two-disc set, they could add a second disc with the original live versions, minus the studio over-dubs included in the current release.  When so many classic albums are being expanded and reissued, there's no excuse for leaving this one in its truncated state.  
 I love the braun oral b toothbush for several reasons...A main one being the small heads on the brushes.  While it may not be the one my dentist sells it is the one I use - with its small heads I am able to easily brush even the back areas...  I always have a pack of these extra heads because you should change your brushes every few months and seeing the new ones in my closet makes me remember.  I LOVE that they are color coded and the main unit can be used by many members of the same family.  I find the brushes firm enough but not course...and my gums are not bothered by the heads at all.  In fact they feel very good.  I love this brush and having the replacement heads around is perfec 
 I'll be honest. This is not the best book of the series. However I don't agree that it is the worst. Yes Laurell CAN limit the amount of sex in the books that seem to be popping up in every chapter, but in this book it does only appear once. Other than the fact that this book is really short ( more like a double spaced essay than a book ) it was still pretty good. It gave us a glimpse back to the Anita that we all know and love. From the call in the middle of the night to the actual animation of a zombie. I was happy to hear more about Micah's backround. We have learned so little of him in previous books that it was overdue. I do hope for a full return of plots like this in the future. I have been a fan since book one, and still enjoy the series. However if the next books in the series don't involve more plot and less .... having Anita try to deal with the ardeur who know's how much longer the truely loyal fans will keep interested in the series. What made Anita a big success was how original it was. But a few more books of just sex and I can see why fans will be on the lookout for the new queen of the night. I will give it another try to finsh up the "loose ends" up with the characters. But I really hope to see a comeback of the executioner! 
 This book was a present from a friend to my son who was 2 at the time my daughter was born.  The children are now 5 and 3, respectively.  It continues as a favorite from amongst the now hundreds of books on their  shelves.   Not only is this book a wonderful lesson of sharing and love  ("There's always room on Mother's lap" has become a mantra in our  house), but it is also a lovely book filled with beautiful images of  everyday Inuit life. I'm now buying a copy for another friend of mine who  is expecting her second child 
 After the 2004 election, "when half the country felt clinically depressed about the reelection of George W. Bush," Robin Meyers, pastor of Mayflower Congregational UCC Church in Oklahoma City, at the behest of students at the University of Oklahoma, gave a speech to protest the war in Iraq. While his speech reads extremely well, it must have so much better heard live. It is broken up essentially into sentences that begin with "when you," and ends with "you are doing something immoral." Here is one example:       "When you cause most of the rest of the world to hate a country that      was once the most loved country in the world and act as if it doesn't      matter what others think of us, only what God thinks of you, you have      done something immoral."  Reverend Meyers then takes his speech, sentence by sentence, and expounds further on it. With clear, thoughtful rhetoric, he makes his case that the Christian Right is in bed with (my image, not his) the Republican Party, "God's Own Party." He discusses what is wrong with Bush and the GOP's position on religion, the environment, the war in Iraq, civil rights, gay rights, tax breaks for the very rich, the death penalty, etc.  Meyers reminds the reader that this administration is the first "ever not to voluntarily add a single species to the endangered species list," and that the U. S. supplied Saddam Hussein with "poison gas, military advisors, and arms. . . in the 1980s" and that Rumsfeld shook his hand in 1983. Reverend Meyers' discussion on what has been done to language in this country (for example, the term "collateral damage") is frightening beyond words; and again he reminds us that George Orwell's 1984 may be the most prophetic book written in the twentieth century.  Meyers in the final pages of this book exhorts the reader to take back this country and tells us what we must do. He urges us to join nonviolent resistance groups, vote out warmongering politicians, get concerned about the environment, and stop spending on "stuff" we do not need. (After all, when Bush sends volunteer soldiers to fight, he urges the rest of us to go shopping.) Finally, he reminds us that the Religious Right does not have a monopoly on Jesus and that we should judge churches by the Sermon on the Mount, rather than their size and location.  Both Bill Moyers and John Selby Spong, two men whose credentials on morality and values are (in my opinion) impeccable, have endorsed this really fine book; they are certainly right about both this most decent man and his book.     
 The true meaning of a "Steely Dan," aside, this a perfect compilation of the smooth, sophisticated sounds of what is one of the great bands of the 70s and 80s.  For the listener who wants to hear classic rock staples such as "FM," "Peg," "Black Friday," "Reelin in the Years," "Kid Charlemagne," "Hey Nineteen," "Deacon Blues," "Rikki Don't Lose That Number," and "Do it Again," who I can remember listening to on 1970s San Francsico rock radio KMEL. As well tracks who while may not have been more well known ("Bodhisattva," "My Old School," and the delightful, souful, "Bad Sneakers")  But.....the carefree, muted sounds of a trumpet and trombone, classical guitar, banjo and the spirited keys of a piano highlight the little known "East St. Louis Toodle-Doo"  composed by Jazz Sensation Duke Ellington. Written in the vein of 1920s Tommy Dorsey Big band sound, this is a hidden gem. A must listened to treat.   "A Decade of Steely Dan." Featuring the talents of guest musicians David Paich, Michael McDonald, Tim Schmidt, Jeff Porcaro and many others.  Steely Dan principals Walter Becker and Donald Fagen were masters of using each instrument to their fullest.  Make this part of your CD collection.  You will glad you did 
 Like many I have a fascination for what I imagine is Italian culture - fine clothes , fine food , beautiful women , beautiful football . Tobias Jones would agree with all these assesssments, however he would also point out the incredible corruption , disastrous bureacracy and the general feeling that in Italy everything is permissable because nothing is punishable . This is not going to make him too popular among Italiophiles who want to have their prejudices confirmed not shattered..but the truth is the truth and much of what Jones says has been verified for me by friends who have lived in Italy as well as Italian friends. Jones clearly loves the country ..... but not enough to blind him to its failing 
 This is a very informative and well written account about the 3rd President of the United States, the immortal Thomas Jefferson.  This biography about the man and his passion for architecture are written down  in easy to follow text that is difficult to accomplish about the complex  man. The planning of Monticello and the labor of building and re-building  are fascinating to think of, especially in the timeframe of which it was  built.  Jefferson was a true genious in his inventions and insight of how  he wanted Monticello to work and function.  People seem to forget that  Jefferson was a gifted man of many talents, and in my opinion, one of his  greatest gifts was architecture.   In architecture of Monticello and the  University of Virginia, Jefferson gives an insight to the man himself.   Simple yet very complex.  Jefferson enjoyed simplicity on the surface, but  peel away the layers of the man, you found a very complex and intellectual  person. The way Monticello was built and rebuilt due to Jefferson changing  tastes and ideas says alot about the mans personal life himself. The only  disturbing thing about Monticello was the human cost of labor that was used  in it being built.  The African-American slaves was the backbone of  building to Jefferson's whim.  This must of took a heavy toll of labor and  lives, due to the magnificence of Monticello.  This by the man who wrote  that "all men are created equal".  An interesting point to  ponder. Overall, this is an excellent read and highly recommended to any  history enthusiasts and enthusiasts of early American architecture 
 This was a great addition to my Medela [...] pump (along with the car adapter). When I pump at work, it frees my hands to do other things. It may take a few extra seconds to attach, but worth it. The only drawback are the hooks that attach to the bra. They easily fall off when not in use. I have to remember to take them off and put them somewhere safe 
 I found this DVD by accident and never looked back.   Girls will be Girls is hilarious, nasty, campy, draggy (?), a hoot from beginning to end.  Really raunchy. Not for the prim and proper.   Be sure to check the special features: one documents the makeup job to change three ordinary-looking guys into fabulous queens; the other is a commentary on the making of the movie - on a shoestring, so it's fun to see how they solved the many production problems (it's shot in some guy's house) and produced a professional quality film 
 The failings of the criminal justice system and the use of the death penalty in this country are currently under close scrutiny and an important topic of public debate. The images and voices of The Innocents give faces and stories to the statistics and serve as a compelling documentation of a nationwide problem. Royalties for this book benefit the Innocence Project, New York, which has led the way in post-DNA exonerations in America 
 A great book, with lots of detail. It is amazing that the von Braun/Nasa team got all that to work, as well as they did. An amazing read. Some much testing was required, because the computers of the time could not support the simulations. Now, with our much faster and better computers, we can'tbuild a Saturn- 
 Huey Lewis & The News were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s', with a string of classic hits that still get heavy airplay today. Over the years, the band has been anthologized several times, but none of these compilations have gotten it right.   "Greatest Hits" compiles 21 classic Huey Lewis & The News tracks, including "The Heart Of Rock & Roll", "The Power Of Love", "Jacob's Ladder", "Stuck With You", "Do You Believe In Love", "Perfect World" and "Hip To Be Square" as well as many more classics. There's some lesser known stuff included here, such as their performance of "Trouble In Paradise" at the legendary Live-Aid concert, and Huey's duet with Gwyneth Paltrow on their cover of "Cruisin'" from the film "Duets". The sound quality is superb (good sound quality is a must when I buy a greatest hits compilation), and just about eveyr bit hit is here.  The cd also comes with a bonus dvd that contains several of their videos and a live performance from 1982 of "Workin' For A Livin'". This is a great compilation that belongs in anyone's record collection 
 The first time I heard Mika I thought that Freddy Mercury had come back. His music is reminiscent of some early Queen, with some very wacky things thrown in here and there. This is not for the mundane, easy listening customer. It is catchy, crazy and fun. Mike is worth listening to, just to hear what he'll come up with next 
 This is a one of its kind book. While "Mastering Herbalism" put forth a lot of remedies and traditional folk uses of healing herbs, this is more about the history and folk uses of halucinogenic herbs, but also covers some traditional healing herbs as well. I found this book incredibly facinating, dry in spots, but otherwise difficult to put down. I highly recommend it, as well as "Plants of the Gods" and a good Peterson's Field Guide if you are going to attempt to find any of the plants listed in this book 
 Different, refreshing, entertaining, funny, eye opening....even better than reading the book is to listen to it (buy the Audio CD!) on a loooooong drive.. 
 Using device to connect two external HD's and a Brother HL-1240 laser printer (parallel only) to my Dell XPS M1210 notebook (no parallel). Works perfectly. No issues 
 I picked this book up on a whim & found it to be outstanding! After the first couple of pages I found myself hooked. I too found myself researching the condition to further validate the author's story. Unexpected ending was a great twist! Editing was terrible but looking forward to his next novel 
 Cerminara demonstrates the enormous reasonableness of the doctrine of reincarnation.  In the process, she also makes a strong case for the existence of perfect justice in the world, despite appearances to the contrary.  Her arguments are illustrated by excerpts from the Edgar Cayce readings, but one need not accept these readings to appreciate the force of Cerminara's argument.  Read this book and learn to take the LONG view of things.  You'll be glad you did 
 A band like the Postal Service produces singles easily -- their trip-hop is fresh, sweet and wistful, as well as being wickedly catchy. And Ben Gibbard (Death Cab For Cutie) and Jimmy Tamborell (Dntel) were in top form in the wistful, lyrically weird "We Will Become Silhouettes."      A flowing, strange story-song, "We Will Become Silhouettes" tells what happens when for some reason, the air causes cells to "Divide at an alarming rate until our shells/Simply cannot hold all our insides in,/And that's when we'll explode/(and it won't be a pretty sight)." Interpret that as you will, but the apocalyptic whimsy of it is irresistable.      A new song follows it: "Be Still My Heart," an enchanting little ballad with rapid percussion overlaid with organ and synth. "Nothing Better (Styrofoam Remix)" is a fair remix that is off in some parts (what is with that fizzing noise?) but retains the plaintiveness as the original. And finally there is the laid-back "We Will Become Silhouettes (Matthew Dear's Not Scared Mix)," which is stripped-down and fragile-sounding.      "We Will Become Silhouettes" is a bit of an oddball song, on an album full of songs about loneliness and lost love. Lyrically, it sounds like one of the Flaming Lips' more mainstream songs. Not that that's a bad thing -- it adds a sense of strangeness and fun to Postal Service's debut. It certainly reflects in the cover, with a rather startled-looking young man surrounded by people who are fading away.      This single does a good job of also showing off the kinds of music that Postal Service can do -- the title song is poppy and smooth, while the second is sort of synthy-drummy. What is even better, the remixes are good. Most remixes cloud over what made the song good in the first place, but Postal Service's are well-done.      "We Will Become Silhouettes" is a solid single, especially with the well-done remixes and extra song. It'll probably leave you humming, "And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go..." 
 I had heard several negative reviews in regards to Alison Weir and her "take" on history regarding Elizabeth I from friends. As a historical actress at our local renaissance faire for many years, I actually enjoyed this book quite a bit. Ms Weir does state that some of the events are historical while others had to be imaginative at times so I dont feel this book misrepresents anything at all. The accuracies are fraught with historical proof therefore the uncertainties don't really matter. Sadly there arent any valid historical documents from Elizabeth's personal journals to compare with, so assumption on what she thought, how she felt or what influenced her at times is perfectly acceptable based upon common knowledge of Elizabeth's upbringing.  I personally own now 4 of Ms Weir's books and have yet to find one I haven't enjoyed. Highly recommend it though it is a bit long and you dont want to put it down. 
 This collection brings together three remarkable novellas by Joseph Conrad: Youth, Heart of Darkness and The End of the Tether. In Youth Charlie Marlow recounts the troublesome voyage of the old ship Judea and its wretched 600-ton cargo of coal. The same Marlow also serves as the narrator in Heart of Darkness, undoubtedly the most famous of the three stories. It details how Marlow takes on a foreign assignment as a ferry boat captain on the Congo River in order to restore communications with Kurtz, an eccentric ivory procurement agent isolated in the secluded midlands. Finally in The End of the Tether Captain Whalley, a former dare-devil skipper, sacrifices his retirement and embarks on a precarious voyage on the steamer Sofala in order to support his distant, beloved daughter.   Like many of Conrad's early novels these three stories are set aboard ships. These stories tell of men who go beyond the normal routine of life to challenge themselves, whether from curiosity or necessity, in order to obtain what they seemingly cannot reach. Conrad depicts these desperate men with a vigor that on its own is already enough reason to dive in these stories. But there is much more. The real power of these masterpieces will only surface after a second read. The first reading is like a voyage into the unknown, not unlike the main characters would have experienced it. Only on a second or third reading do you become more aware of the subliminal power of the words and can you appreciate the full power of the colorful narrative. This way the at first read overly long descriptive passages get more and more significance and surely reveal their significance to the story.  One of the many layers to the stories is the drive to react against the self-proclaimed dominance of the human race: both against his environment as against his fellow man. In Heart of Darkness Marlow even literally proclaims that the unbounded exploitation of the natural resources is a disfigurement to the human conscience. Therefore it is not surprising that theme of alienation was craftily interwoven in John Milius' script for Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now loosely based upon Conrad's novella.  Not everyone will be charmed by the dense narrative and slow pace of these stories. But if you manage to see beyond this dated style, what is left is simply a masterpiece 
 Sony has done it again!  Fast charging and LONG lasting, this battery is perfect for my Sony Cyber-Shot Camera! 
 Can't ask for more, clear sound, nicely finished, easy to use and the best part is the iPlug just plug it and you are done, your ipod doesn't get power from the 12v oultlet of the car (better for ipod's helth) no interferience like FM modulators. It doesn't get any better for the price 
 That's Italian for I changed my mind. I like Jane Monheit very much.  I have nearly every album, and "The Very Best of Jane Monheit" offers a good selection of her songs, but I previously dissed this collection for not being my favorite versions of each song.. I have listened to this album, and I enjoy it even though these are just not necessarily my favorite renditions. For one thing, there is an above average (for Jane) amount of scatting. I like when she does that and wish there were more of it on all her albums. For another, This must be her fourth album with "Over the Rainbow" on it! I prefer the version on the "Live at the Rainbow Room" album.  This album, as with all such collections means you can here these songs together without going back and forth from album to album. I never have that much of a desire to hear these particular songs on one album, but it is enjoyable to hear them together anyway 
 The order arrived on schedule. There were no flaws or irregularities. The card fit my camera and did a good capturing and storing pitures 
 The only annoying thing about this great documentary on the famous baseball team is that events are told more than once too often.You sometimes say to yourself that you saw some of the things in the first dvd when you watch the second.Apart from that,this has it all,from the stars of each decade to the singles greatest teams;from the tragic deaths of LOU GEHRIG and THURMAN MUNSON to the MANTLE-MARIS historic 1961 season.Baseball fans can't go wrong by buying this 2 dvd set.I really enjoyed the chapter about the YANKEE STADIUM best.When you think about it,baseball without the YANKEES would not mean the same.They really choose the best moments,although it would have been nice to have an hidden camera to catch all the controversy surrounding REGGIE JACKSON when he was playing there.I would have suggest a wrestling cage match between REGGIE and BILLY MARTIN as a bonus feature.Buy this,it's worth your money, even if the MONTREAL CANADIENS are the all time best on my list 
 This play defies words. You probably already know this, but this play is structured as a "docudrama," somewhere between a documentary and a plot/character driven play. Laramie weaves together threads of national strife, the eternal fight against hatred and a plethora of deep, powerful characters. One of my favorite moments in this play comes when a middle aged gay man sits in his apartment and describes the rapidly growing group of people marching in a parade honoring Matthew in his last days, how eventually more people are marching for Matthew than for the parade itself. This play is a  triumph of the human spirit that has arisen from a truly dark moment in recent American history. The recent HBO movie is a well-done rendition, although, having seen three different productions and been involved in one, I must say that the play is a bit more moving. Read it, and for the sake of the late Matthew Shepard, if you get the chance, SEE IT 
 Without a Net is an excellent CD! I love the Dead!! I love this CD!! I like to keep my reviews concise so I will not mention all of the highlights. There are too many. China Cat Sunflower opens with an excellent guitar riff and goes uphill from there. Eyes of the World is an excellent song in its own right, but an appearance by Brandford Marsalis makes it so much better. Here is a summary of my review: this album is just what the title of my review said it was.  Buy it and enjoy! 
 This book is a fictious tale of a young woman named, Kai runniing the drug empire in NYC.  It's an excellent read, that's beautifully written.  Purchase a book light, you won't be able to put this novel down.  
 After learning of Wilson Pickett's passing, my thoughts had returned to my teenage years and how his music had made me feel and other happenings during this period in my life. I remember the good times and decided I wanted to have something to help remember them.  "Mustang Sally" was always a favorite with memories of those "hot" chicks of my youth and tight sweaters.  "Land of a thousand Dances" was also a favorite for all the dances that I attended of which this was a favorite to dance to 
 Another stop-motion Animagic hit from the holiday entertainers, of Rankin/Bass Studios, the kings of holiday TV specials. This 1 hour show was released for the first time on April 6, 1977 on ABC television network. The storyline is very similar to "Santa Claus is Coming to Town", from the same studio - and by that I meant that part of the story explains all the traditions of Easter and how they began, such as why we eat chocolate bunnies, or why we color eggs. The show opens with a newsreel showing kids asking these questions.  Fred Astaire reprises his role as the singing mailman S.D. Kluger and gives a great voice performance but he has a bigger role this time. He has traded in his snowmobile mail truck for "the little engine that could", voiced by Robert McFadden. In the story we go back in time to the beginning of the children's Easter traditions to answer these questions, to a hidden town called "Kidville". There is a scary bear named Gadzooks who hates holidays, and he is similar to the Winter Warlock character. A rabbit named "Sunny" grows up to be the Easter Bunny and bring joy to children, making great friends and allies along the way. He is voiced by Skip Hinnant, who voiced "Pogo" in a special from another studio. He befriends a lonely young King, named Bruce, who is being controlled and bullied by his tyrannical Aunt Longtooth.   We have come to expect good music in these holiday specials and they did not disappoint. There are 6 songs total with music by Maury Laws and lyrics by Jules Bass including the catchy, "Someone's Got to be First", along with "Big Rock Candy Mountain", the inspiring "Somebody Will Love You, If You Do", and "The Easter Bunny is Coming to Town Today". Fred Astaire sings "All You Have to Do is - Think Can Do". There is a hilarious song by the Hendrew Sisters, "What Came First, the Chicken or the Egg?". This very colorful special has terrific character designs by Paul Coker, who did the same for most of the studios products. The look of the film is, well, very Easter... They just did a great job capturing what the visuals should be for the kids.  This show is the 3rd and last of the Easter themed holiday shows made by the studio. In 1971 they made an hour long Animagic TV special for ABC, "Here Comes Peter Cottontail", about the selection contest for the Easter Bunny, and it actually travels through time to all the holidays. In 1976 they made a half hour traditional cel animation special "The First Easter Rabbit" for NBC. As you know, Rankin/Bass Studios brought us such beautiful holiday TV classics such as Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Year without a Santa Claus, `Twas the Night Before Christmas, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, Mouse on the Mayflower, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, and more. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit, and Flight of Dragons. It is incredible that one company was responsible for all those TV specials, 95% of the ones we see every year. Their work includes traditional hand drawn cel animation, stop-motion Animagic, and live action. Little Golden Books Publishing owns the rights to almost every show the studio made, and have done a commendable job re-mastering them and releasing them on DVD. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD too; I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD. 
 The last soundblaster I had used was a soundblaster Live a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been relying on onboard sound on Nforce based motherboards. Sound quality was okay, but there always seemed to be issues with the drivers and a fair amount of background noise on the analog outputs. I decided to upgrade to the X-fi when I started to have sound dropouts while playing Oblivion.   Sound quality from the X-Fi is great, especially with headphones. I'm only using the Drive bay I/O panel for the headphone jack, but the price of the Platinum version wasn't much more than just the basic card, so it was money well spent. If I had this set up as a media center PC, the remote control functions would make this an even better deal.  A few notes: -I had no problems installing this on an NForce4 based motherboard (Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe) -The I/O drive bay only comes in black. If you still have a tan case you're out of luck -There is a digital SPDIF output available on the back of the card. It's a mini 1/8" jack, and unfortunately no adapter to RCA jack is included 
 Douglas Wood is a breath a fresh air in our consumeristic world.  He offers children a view of life that treasures the simple pleasures, and appreicate each moment life has to offer.  A real find for children - AND adults. The core message of this book has become MY daily reflection for the year.  His books resonate deeply in me and my children LOVE them 
 This book was a textbook to me.  It's a huge work with lots of details.  You won't just read "This was a city in this region where these people lived and did this kind of work."  You will read how the city got started, how it rose and fells, and the repercussions of what went on there.  You will heard specific names and dates, and all kinds of complex information.  Unless you are a history major, this book may seem very daunting, but if you want to know everything, here you go! Okay, it doesn't cover every single city ever,  but it is a great companion to other books. If your interest is American history, then I also recommend Ronald Takaki's 'A Different Mirror. 
 This is about the only mouse I buy, have gone through a couple of them in the past few years.  I just can't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out.  This model is one that I find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using.  If you want a good, reliable, comfortable mouse, this logitech is a good choice 
 I have had anorexia for 11 years. I am now 24 and am in treatment. Hall and Ostroff's book helped me to understand that I was not alone, and that I was in charge. Most importantly, and the most difficult issue to deal with  is that anorexia teaches you things about yourself. I strongly recommend  this book to someone who does not know where to start. No, once you read  it, you will not be cured but at least you will have explored what you are  most afraid of--letting go of the control and the selfdestructive coping  strategies. I read the book within the first week of group therapy and came  the next week with photocopies of certain sections that were very helpful  for the rest of the members. This book helps you want to get rid of the  anorexic thoughts. You will be much happier while on the road of recovery.  Letting go of the obsessive thoughts that come with anorexia was the best  thing I have ever done 
 This is the best book I've read for someone learning Spanish.  It uses terminology within the 1st semester and has a very good grasp of which words need further definition.  I highly recommend this book for anyone learning Spanish.  It does not speak down to the student, but instead, gives the student credit for a good deal of intelligence and shows confidence in the reader.  I give this book top marks and rate it at the top of it's class 
 Does a good job of explaining what UML is and how an analyst can use it to make everyone's job a little easier. It has perked the interest of several people at the company where I work 
 good book if you need one with alot of pages that wont bored you. Stephen King pwnes escpially with "Eyes Of The Dragon" its not even about a dragon really dont know why they call it that but anyways excellent book recommend it for ages 14 u 
 At first, thought it was dull, but after watching the movie, i like it, never thought it would be the start of great series 
 Hassam al Banna never approved the assassination of Noukrashi Pasha (Egypt's Prime Minister during the life and rein of King Farouk I), it was the military arm of the Movement that decided and carried it out, without Banna's explicit approval. Banna was as shocked as the King. Latest interviews with contemporary ex-members of the Brotherhood in Egypt who were close to Banna testified that the `Morshed' - Guider - had never `ruled' as an autocrat; at times he was ruled by his strong-willed military `wing' who had been morbidly suspicious of the Palace/PM intentions towards the Muslim Brotherhood. Under the urging of Banna who was anxious to have `his men' come to terms with the PM, the attempt was postponed two times. But old antagonisms were so strong (because of the war in Palestine, and the decision made by the PM to purge the Army of all members of the Muslim Brotherhood).  The Palace ordered the assassination of Al Banna in retaliation to the killing of Noukrashi Pasha.   Al-Banna's successor, Hodehbie sought to improve relations with the Palace. A personal touch of friendliness with the King was considered to widen Brotherhood's sphere of influence as a `balancing factor' against the ever-present popular el- Wafd Party. After al Banna, King Farouk I regarded the Brotherhood movement as his own sphere of influence and tried by clever approaches (like to subsidize the financing of their newspaper) to woo them out of any alliances with the Wafd.  While al Banna maxim was `keep friends with the masses', his successor's was `keep friends with the King' 
 Hands down, the best Star Wars novel from the Clone Wars era. The added information about Dooku and his relationship with Yoda is crucial to understand his turn into the darkness. And, unlike most Star Wars novel, there is actually an elegance to the writing in this novel that simply isn't present in most others. The bad part---or, shall I say, the dark side?---is that, after reading this one, my standards have been much higher for other Star Wars novels ... and most of them, while enjoyable, simply haven't delivered 
 I've never watched any shows regularly on FX until this year, when I happened to catch a double episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, about 3 episodes into Season 2. I don't remember when I've laughed so hard in the past few years. This show is hysterical! Charlie Day, what can I say? I dare say he is the funniest character on television. Case in point, the episode: Hundred Dollar Baby.   The gang's walking home in the evening (Charlie, Mac, Dennis and Dee) when an apparent Meth Head tries to mug them. Charlie Mac and Dennis all run away, knocking down Dee to fend for herself (intentionally or non-intentionally? You decide.).  Dee gets mugged and decides she's going to take some kind of "box-er-cizing" thing to learn how to defend herself, but her dad Frank, played by Danny DeVito, pipes up and says if she wants to learn to defend herself she should learn from him, being that he's a former boxer ("Frankie Fast Hands"). She agrees.  In the meantime, Dennis and Mac convince Charlie to become an underground street fighter after attending one and realizing that "All you really need is to be able to take a worse beating than the other guy." Mac asks Dennis "You know who can take a beating?" And they both instantly turn to each other and say "CHARLIE."  What's great about Charlie is that he's usually up for anything as long as there's money or excitement in it, and this is no exception.  Back to Dee - at the gym she's approached by another woman who offers her some assistance in the form of so-called "Performance Enhancing Supplements." Dee's now popping pills, which Charlie sees while accidentally catching her (she doesn't know he saw her), and now Charlie is popping her pills.  I refuse to spoil the rest, but rest assured that this is one of the funniest things you will see this year, and the rest of the series is no exception.  I have yet to see an un-funny character on this show, but Charlie steals the show almost every time. Charlie Day is comedy GOLD 
 I read this book in one sitting and was delighted.  This book offers a smorgasbord of honest views in re parenting teens/young adults and offered refreshing insights.  I was delighted to see two of my favorite authors, Joyce Maynard and Louise Erdrich among those included in this book.  Each author has helped shed even more light on an interesting aspect of their lives.  The essay format personalized the accounts and made the reader feel included.  Joyce Maynard, a gifted writer included an essay about her son's girlfriend spending the night.  Her essay was unflinchingly honest; clear, sharp and direct as are all her works.  That is what makes them outstanding and effective.  I like the honest conversations she had with her three children and how she took a healthy and honest approach to sex and sexuality.  To her credit, she taught them the correct names for genitals instead of silly, infantile euphemisms.  One funny anecdote she shared was when her youngest child, then 4, sang about vaginas on a city bus, much to the consternation of his fellow passengers.  I like the way she responded and kept communication lines open for her children.  Erdrich's account of her daughter's driving was touching and funny.  One can almost feel the snow and ice as they navigate the icy streets of Minnesota.  The inclusion of fathers' essays helped make for a nice balance and richer picture.  This book is a beautiful mosiac, pieced together by the brilliant works of each author.    
 "MORTIMER" combines a familiar and hilarious story with a repetitive format that always appeals to my kindergarten students.  Each year, I read "MORTIMER" to my class.  We follow up with choral  reading and creative dramatics.  Students are selected to portray Mortimer,  Mom, Dad and the two police officers.  Other classmates double as the  seventeen brothers & sisters, and the audience.  Everyone 'thumps' up  & down the stairs and sings the refrain.  My students read and reread  this beloved book.  Thanks to Robert Munsch and Mortimer, I am able to  foster a lifelong love of literature.  "MORTIMER" is a staple in  our classroom library 
 After having read HOW TO DEVELOP SELF-CONFIDENCE & INFLUENCE PEOPLE  by PUBLIC SPEAKING by Dale Carnegie, I genuinely feel compelled to write a brief review.   First, I found this book to be useful and pratical.  The author provides general principles regarding how to develop self-confidence and improve one's speaking peformance, then provides an illustration of that principle.  In other words, the author is effectively instructing us on how to improve our public speaking peformance, which is critical in so many professions.   Second, this book contains brilliant depth.  In fact, to be forward, I was skeptical I would even find this book useful.  I have provided speeches with nearly 300 people in attendance.  However, when it came to my performance before small groups --say, three to twelve people-- I tended to flounder.  From this book, I learned that I must prepare for my short presentations as I prepare for my more lengthy presentations.  A few quick pointers:  memorize your opening and closing, which I was not doing for my small group presentations;  I was often attempting to "wing" them.  However, subsequently reading this book, my presentations are more effective and have more grace.   Third and in conclusion, the final chapter was somewhat astonishing for me.  I was literally mispronouncing a few words, and I am very grateful for having received instruction and guidance from the author.  For example, I was mispronouncing vIand, antIdote, amEnable, cUlinary, sUpine, lab-o-ra-tory, bev-er-age, Cath-o-lic, choc-o-late, di-a-mond, fo-li-age, gal-ler-y, et al.!  I honestly state with confidence that this little treasure is a "must read" for professionals, particularly those required to speak before small and large audiences.  On a final note, I only wish I had read this book earlier, my life would have been quite easier.     Sincerely, Clovi 
 Ever since I got this album six months ago I have not been able to stop listening to it.  I am absolutely in love with it.  All of Nek's songs are very enjoyable and you'll find yourself singing along after you've listened to it once or twice.  Even now when I listen to the CD, I listen to it at least two times.  The whole CD is great especially "Sto con te," "La Vita e`," and "Cielo e terra," which is a great song to have at the end of the album because it keeps you listening until the very end.  This is such a great CD and I reccommend any fan of italian music to buy it. Che Buonissimo 
  This movie is a "must see" for every child. Heartwarming and inspirational. We've made viewing PRANCER a Thanksgiving Tradition in our family. It ushers in the Christmas Season each year. Share PRANCER with your children or grandchildren. You will be so glad you did. 
 Packed with advice from some of the top writers working in the biz today. Great questions, great answers. I read this book over & over again, whenever I'm stuck, dipping into the appropriate section. Great book. Thanks, Karl 
 It is such a pleasure to listen to this recording. Not only is it refreshingly different from the commercialized fare that is so prevalent, but it is a wonderful showcase for Lessack's lovely voice and for an  astonishing variety of songs, from the old spiritual, "The Water is  Wide" to the standard "Out of this World" to many songs not  familiar to most listeners 
 I have been a Barry Manilow fan since I was a teenager.  I have NEVER been disappointed with any of his work and this CD is no exception!  He is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous!  His voice is as good as ever!  Even my 7 year old begs to listen to the CD everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words!  
 This is the greatest movie that i have ever seen.  It is funny and the cast does some sweet moves.  I personally like the king of the mountain part. [...] Anytime by Eve 6 and makes no differece by Sum 41 is sweet 
 "A High Wind in Jamaica" is quite possibly the best book about children written in 20th century.  It's two successors being William Golding's "Lord of the Flies," and J.D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye."  Richard Hughes' uncanny ability to lay bare the mind of a child offers continuous, piercing insights unclouded by judgement or sentimentality.  His prose evokes the strange, often bewildering perception of the innocent, with an objective, childlike point of view. Be forwarned though this novel is not for those who would dislike spending a day in the mind of young children.  Those, however, interested in child psychology or just facinated by the nature of the young will enjoy this rare gem of a book 
 The story is that of a true toddler / pre-schooler trying to stay up a bit later.  Very cute 
 Warning: This book requires a strong foundation of physics knowledge. The author refers to relativity and skims over quantum mechanics pretty quickly in applying his thoughts.  As for the material itself, the book is great. Deutsch gives us a tour of leading theoretical physics and their applications to our understanding to the physical universe. For anyone interested in physics, epistemology, or philosophy, the narrative is engrossing as Deutsch meticulously develops ideas that really work your brain over.   My only issue with this book is the author's idea of the "four strands." Granted, Deutsch only claims that the future model of reality will include these four strands (evolution, computing, quantum mechanics, Popperian theory) in some way. Yet, I don't find his strands to intertwine with one another. His discourse on quantum mechanics is fascinating, but doesn't significantly tie-in to his overall philosophy. Deutsch does show wonderful similarities between Popperian epistemology, Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and the Turing Principle. But again, he doesn't develop an overall encompassing philosophical model.  Regardless, the book is informative, a pleasure to read, and well-written. Definitely recommened 
 I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. "Ten Things I Hate About You" is VERY LOOSELY based on William Shakespeare's comedic masterpiece, "The Taming of the Shrew." The film is set in a modern day high school. Kat (Julia Stiles) is an angry teenage girl who seems to loathe all men. Her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is a popular girl who can't wait to immerse herself in the dating scene. Unfortunately for Bianca, her overprotective father (Larry Miller) is incredibly paranoid and doesn't want to see either of his daughters come within 50 feet of a member of the opposite sex. In order to pacify Bianca's constant complaints, her father finally concedes that he'll lift the dating ban as soon as man-hater Kat shoes an interest in boys, which is unlikely to happen in the near future. Once Bianca's potential beau (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds out about this, he hires a mysterious classmate, Patrick (Heath Ledger), to feign an interest in Kat and loosen her up, thereby freeing up Bianca to date. At first Patrick is happy to oblige, but he is stunned when he begins to develop feelings for Kat, who isn't always as cold and collected as she appears to be.  This movie is very entertaining. As a big "Taming of the Shrew" fan, I really enjoyed the occasional snippets of Shakespearean dialogue. This film does an excellent job of reinventing Shakespeare in a very modern way. Also, the young cast is talented and fun to watch. Stiles and Ledger have good chemistry together and make a very cute onscreen couple. Overall, I was very impressed 
 I read some chapters during second year of college, and I found a bit difficult. Later, after college, I read Feller's books (Vol I,II) and I could appreciate Feller's books as excellent : a delicate mix of rigor and intuition that only the verfy gifted can write. 
 I would only use genuine Epson Ink for my 2200 and when Amazon has them on sale with free shipping- it is really a great deal 
 I am a former high school classmate of Randy Wayne White's and was in his English Lit. class when our teacher critiqued one of his essays that he had written. She told Randy, in front of the entire class that, "You will never make it as a writer, Mr. White.  This is absolutely pathetic."    In addition to the other works of Randy Wayne White, this book is proof that "not all teachers are always right".   Randy has out done himself with this book.  I could not put it down and read it in two sittings, a record time for me.  I am looking forward to his next book 
 This is the second volume of Braudels Civilization and Capitalism. The second volume deals with the market economy, while the first volume, Structures of Everyday Life takes on infra-economy or material civilization. As I said on the review of the first volume, in the pre-industrialized societies, the market system is not the only form of resource allocation. The material civilization is the first layer of economy on the bottom, the market system is the second layer located above the first layer. The exchange or commerce was not natural economy but artificial economy in the jargon of the 18th C economics: Market is premised on the separation of production and consumption. Such a division is not natural, but is developed over long time. In this vein, the market is not natural at all. The market is the point in which material life and economic life meet each other. The market is the network. It links region to region, national economy to national economy. The form and scope of market has been evolved over time. When we track the forms of market, we could paint the history of capitalism. Nonetheless, Capitalism is often regarded as synonymous to market economy. But market is not unique to capitalism. But it goes without saying that capitalism cant exist without market. All economic activities under capitalism are carried out on the market. Changes in the form of market signals the changes of capitalism. When, for example,  we talk about globalization, we have in mind the change of market based on national economy to global market. The second volume is about the topology of market. Based on the scope of space the market serves, we could trace out the path of capitalism since the 15th C. But market is not capitalism. To understand this point, youd better check the third volume, The Perspective of the World 
 Children enjoyed this book. Used in map unit for PS and elem. settings. 
 It is glorious and delightful - service was excellen 
 Nancy Snow's modest little booklet points to an important strand in corporate America's thrust for global power: The take-over of the United States Information Agency. A propaganda organ of government since its WWI inception, the USIA now sells the Fortune 500 agenda to reluctant foreigners at tax payer expense. And here I thought only the bad old soviets made government an arm of the economy. Snow, a former employee of the agency, details this transition from cold war asset to America's neo-liberal mouthpiece to the world. Given big money's recent take-over of the Democrat party and other citizen institutions, Snow's revelation may not surprise most readers. Nevertheless, the details make informative reading, and while I would have preferred a more muckraking approach, her academic restraint undercores a deep disillusion, as reflected in her 7-Point Plan for Citizen-Based Diplomacy. The latter aims at challenging corporate dominance with citizen action and people priorities. Coming from a former insider, this speaks volumes. One hopes the message will resonate 
 Since I really like history and especially want to know the truth and not legend, I enjoyed this book.  It was a far cry from the story we read in school 
 I'd forgotten how good this film was, I really had, I had vague memories of being sat down in front of a video, and there was a large scary lady in purple doing bad things. But that was it, I'd forgotten how heart-warming and beautiful the film was.  The first step toward making this film a true Disney masterpiece, is the fact that the story is so strong. I was totally engrossed by it, and didn't get bored for a moment. I had forgotten about the sweet scenes in the town and by the river, they are what a film needs, character development and just a slight expansion of the story beyond the basic bones of the tale. Sure, it's not a faithful rendition of the original tale, but it isn't about tragedy, it's about love and your dreams coming true.  The animation, whilst not as accomplished as some of their slightly later films (such as the Hunchback of Notre Dame) is a delight to behold, and it really makes the mer-people seem very believable in the movement and actions. The animators of Ariel must of been very pleased with themselves, she comes across as being real (well, as real as a cartoon can be) I can see in her facial expressions will genuine expressions, not pale imitations as is so often the case in animation.  The soundtrack really makes it, generally, I find Disney side-kicks obtrusive and annoying, but Sebastian makes the film, I never imagined reggae style music could manage to be romantic! The key song, is also beautiful, whilst I don't know the title (shameful I know) the words continue to soar through my mind, 'now we can run....etc.!'  The extras are also very worthwhile, a fascinating making of, some games for the children and deleted scenes (utilising unused storyboards.) There is also a commentary and a new music video for 'Kiss the Girl.' However the best of them all has got to be the beautiful and tragic, 'The Little Match-Girl,' I can honestly say that few other films have managed to move me so deeply, I couldn't remembered the last time I cried over a film, until I saw this one. I knew it would be special when I watched the introduction by the director, he mentioned how he use to read the story to his children - it made me remember my parents use to read me the story too. I really hope that it will be Oscar Nominated - it deserves it.  Equally satisfying for any child or film critic. A true classic.  - Rachael  
 I had this Babar book as a child and could not resist buying it for my daughter, and I am so happy that I did.  This book is so incredible, the pictures and colors so vibrant and the text so incredibly addictive, that your child wil carry it with her forever.  I know I have.  I was stunned by how much of the dialogue and how many of the pictures I remembered.  This book is a reasure that you and your children will share for years to come.  Some people my comment about some of the themes, but as a child they went over my head, and as an adult, I recognized how tastefully done they are.  Highest possible recommendatio 
 Like young Arthur of the thousand-year old legend of Camelot, our hero, Will Stanton, is surprised early in his adolescence to learn that in fact he is not a normal boy. He is someone for whom great things are destined, and who naturally feels totally unprepared for the daunting responsibilities thrust on him. It's a classic trope, one that has been used thousands of times, most familiarly for this generation in the Harry Potter series. Unlike J.K. Rowling however, Susan Cooper puts Will firmly in the middle of a loving family. Both parents are positive characters, and even his many siblings, with their teasing and pranks, ultimately support and care for each other. I recommend that parents read this book with their children, it won't bore them, and it has themes that can be discussed over and over.  
 WARNING: SPOILERS APLENTY!  A successful series character can be both a blessing and a curse. While authors desire the economic rewards that come from creating such a character, they sometimes grow tired of revisiting their children, often wishing (and even writing) them dead (the most famous example being Sherlock Holmes' plunge over the Reichenbach Falls). Perversely, a series both lowers and raises readers' expectations. Fans crave new thrills, but resist radical changes to characters they've grown fond of.  F. Paul Wilson understands this dichotomy, and so has handled his most popular creation, the enigmatic Repairman Jack, very carefully.  For years, the author was down right stingy in using the character, limiting his appearances to a handful of short stories and two novels (THE TOMB and NIGHTWORLD).  Then, in 1997, he published LEGACIES, the first of several novels which account for the time that elapsed between those two novels.  Jack conceals his identity from the authorities, choosing to operate in the shadows--he earns his living as a fixer, a professional who solves problems for a fee. Jack is a tough, creative individual, a man with a touch of the adventurer in him, a combination of Travis McGee, Dirk Pitt, and Alan Quartermain. The pragmatic repairman does what he must to resolve problems, and will kill an adversary without regret if necessary.  Initially, I saw Jack as a distant cousin to John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee. When I questioned Wilson on this point, he acknowledged the similarity, but said that Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories had a far more direct influence on the books. Once stated, the resemblance is obvious, especially in relation to THE TOMB. Wilson cannily updates Rohmer's pulpish notions, creating equally evil, but far more realistic villains for Jack. Instead of the stereotype of the inhuman, inscrutable Chinese (Rohmer called Fu Manchu "The Devil's agent on earth!"), Wilson uses Indians and Arabs, real human beings with plausible motivations and real emotions. In THE TOMB, Kusum's sister Kolabati is an analog for Fah Lo Suee, Fu Manchu's sexy daughter. Jack himself is a stand in for Nayland Smith, a brash American who shares many of that adventurer's finer qualities.  In THE TOMB, Jack faces two dilemmas, one fantastic, the other more mundane. Jack, who, since his first repair job at the age of eleven has gained a substantial reputation for his effectiveness and discretion, is hired by an Indian diplomat named Kusum Bahkti to find the man who mugged his mother for a necklace she was wearing. Jack succeeds in this quest, returning the jewelry, little realizing the profound effect this repair Job will have on his life.  Jack's other problem involves his girlfriend Gia DiLauro, who only recently discovered the true nature of his "consulting" business. Shocked, she confronts him, leaving him when he refuses to give up his odd way of life. When Gia's Aunt Grace disappears, however, she reluctantly seeks Jack's assistance. Jack's search for the old woman leads him back to Kusum and his sister Kolabati, who are pursuing an ancient vendetta against Gia's in-laws, the Westphalens.  Aiding Kusum in his quest for vengeance are the Rakoshi, a savage race of monsters whose ferocity is only exceeded by their viciousness. Over the decades, Kusum and his kin have used the Rakoshi to exterminate the Westphalen family, until only Gia's aunts and Gia's daughter Vicky remain. At the conclusion of The Tomb, Jack is forced to battle dozens of these merciless creatures to rescue Vicky, the last Westphalen, who is like a daughter to him.  THE TOMB ends with Jack dazed and bleeding in his apartment, too weak to summon assistance. Jack survived, and subsequently appeared in several short stories and in NIGHTWORLD, part of Wilson's legendary Adversary cycle. Jack returned to center stage after many years in 1997's LEGACIES and has made almost annual appearances ever since.  Each entry in the series is well written, deftly plotted, and well worth your time.    
 I never had listened to this sort of music before with much interest, and the first several times through it I wasn't quite sure I liked it....but then I found myself whistling the tunes and replaying and replaying it!!!  I LOVE it now and I pray that there is a second "Rogue's Gallery" in the works.  This isn't your usual tired, worn-out sea chanty ditties!!!!  More!!!  More!!!  
 I absolutely loved this book.  I am not a physicist or mathematician (in fact I can barely remember the basic multiplication tables), but I studied philosophy in college and I find that the most rewarding source of interesting material regarding the nature of reality is in not in philosophy but in popular science books like this one.  I am a big Brian Greene fan and I think this book is a fanstastic follow-up.  Leonard Susskind is very much an ADVOCATE for his position; he doesn't merely spoonfeed the reader with facts and figures about String Theory.  I could really feel the author's passion throughout the book and he has a great talent for communicating his ideas to a layperson in a very engaging and often humorous way.  Needless to say, I am as convinced as any non-physicist could be by Susskind's argument.  Some reviewers have called it quack science but Susskind's conclusions to me make absolute common sense and are a far cry from the typical new-agey psuedo science bull I see all over the place.  Anyway, very highly recommended.  I would love to see more books from Susskind on horizons and the holographic principle 
 Despite heavy dialogue and a vision for the violent that would, perhaps, even make O'Connor a bit nervous; Crews has managed a story about a man on the edge that touches the gritty corners of the Southern experience.    Crews characters are surprizingly dymanic for people who are almost gloriously "redneck" in their approach to life.    This book manages to make you laugh at some of the most profoundly disturbing aspects of rural southern life.  The cruelty of the book is almost naturalistic in nature.  The only reason I don't rate this book with five stars is some of Crew's female characters can be a little harder to shallow than his men as well as the dialogue in the book being almost unnecessarily thick at points. 
 A lot has already been said about this novel, so I'll address my review to those unfamiliar with Mccarthy's work.  If you've never read Mccarthy before, this is a great place to start.  The plot is tight, engaging, and easy to follow, and the language is gorgeous.  If you enjoy this book and want to move on to others, read the others in the border trilogy before tackling "Blood Meridian."    Some people will take issue with Mccarthy's grammar, sentence structure, use of Spanish, and punctuation (or lack thereof).  Mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing, and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning.  The sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and "breath," meaning that they don't always look or sound like conventional prose.  This will be displeasing to some.  As an example, the first line of the book reads:  "The candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door."  Now, Mccarthy could have just as easily said "the candle flickered when he entered the room," or something like that, but the effect, aurally, is just not the same.  Read the first page of the book.  If you don't catch fire at the beauty of it, then maybe this book, and Mccarthy's work in general, is not for you 
 Having Leiter's book on hand is like having a doctor friend around to give relevant advice when needed. The author's tone is friendly and straight forward without oversimplifying or glossing over information. Personally, I tend to be a bit overwhelmed by "scary" facts, but somehow the author is able to inform the reader without overwelming her too much.    If you're looking for a cutsey book advising you whether give your twins rhyming names, this probably isn't the one for you, however if you're seeking a comprehensive look at the physical and psychological needs of a woman pregnant with twins, I highly recommend it 
 The best part about the book is the list of questions about the woman in each chapter, which makes you think a little deeper about the woman's story in the Bible.  The questions are ideal for either personal or group study.  The sections with background information were also very helpful.  Since I am a little old-fashioned and prefer to use the King James Version of the Bible with its more poetic language, I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 
 It has Michael Biehn in it so it is great - did see it on TV (and taped it) and wanted it without commercials also 
 This is a strong book about the lives of woman and societal pressures on them. The protaganist (Akhila) wants to live her life alone yet societial expectations don't allow her to. She meets several other woman in the ladies compartment (coupe) of a train, where each share their life to help her with her decision.  This is a great book but the only reason I give it a four is because I didn't like the ending. I still didn't get if Akhila finds her answer about living alone? Isn't that what she wanted but then how come at end she thinks about her past love. Read the book and you will understand 
 The Venom Saga is an animated series and Spiderman The Venom Saga features five episodes of the series. Each episode includes an introduction by Marvel king Stan Lee. The DVD also has some cool features such as Stan Lee's Soap Box, and The Venoumous Web. Venom is one of the most popular villans that Spider Man has ever faced. If you have children who enjoyed the Spiderman movies they will probably enjoy this DVD, I know my kids enjoyed it 
 The book was published in 1989. After traveling to Cyprus to witness the conflict between Turkey and Greece, visiting Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia, Topkapi museum... the book is a great addition to my learning about the Islamic culture.  Sultan (emperor), Grand Seraglio harem, Golden Cage, Ottoman Dynasty 1540-1990, polygamy with 4 kadins (wives), Koran reading and praying at the mosque, dalisques (female slaves for servants), slave markets in Alexandria and Cairo, black eunuchs, kismet (fate), one thousand and one nights, Turkish hamams (bath), plus an exquisite collection of the art work, make this a great book to read. The book would be better if it includes stories about a specific sultan and his kadins, dalisques and eunuchs.   
 Does anyone know the song being played when they raid jonny tran's place?? I can't find it anywhere 
 If you ever thought about doing an ultra but weren't quite sure, this movie will convince you either way. It comes as close as a DVD can to putting you out in Death Valley and letting you go. It's probably closer than many people want to get to the edge: raw, fascinating, and exciting. Don't make the mistake I did of lending it to a friend, you'll never get it back. A great movie. 
 I'm a huge fan of Jump5, but I think that they rushed the release of THE VERY BEST OF JUMP5. Most of these songs have been popular really recently, and throwing them all onto one CD with three new songs wasn't the best idea.  Highlights of THE VERY BEST OF JUMP5 are: *Spinnin' Around - The first Jump5 song I ever heard, and it's still one of my favorites. It's a catchy, bubbly pop song that can put anybody in a good mood. *Beauty and the Beast - From the original Disneymania CD. At first, I didn't like this song at all - how can you take a classic song like Beauty and the Beast and turn it into a funky, dance-pop song? After giving it another try, I realized that it's actually a pretty good cover. Sure, it's not like the original, but it's got a little "Jump5 spin" to it. *Beautiful to Me - One of the new songs on the CD, Beautiful to Me is one of my favorites. It has the newer, more mature sounding Jump5 on it, and I love it.   THE VERY BEST OF JUMP5 is a good CD, but I feel like it would have been a lot more memorable if it was released in a few years. The three new tracks are all pretty good, except for the song "Friends," which is a disappointment and is definately the worst song on the CD. Recommend to hardcore Jump5 fans, but that's about it. 
 Russ Kick has written a fun little book that combines the "truthiness" of tabloid journalism with paranoid conspiracy theory in 50 little bite-size chunks. It's a blast to read if you don't take it too seriously.   Some of the "secrets" disclosed in Kick's book are pretty tame and obvious. For example, some African-Americans did indeed fight for the Confederacy in the Civil War. The Germans did use IBM computers to keep track of many concentration camp inmates. And of course, the government is known to lie, dissemble and distort the facts about just about anything when the political pressure is on.  On the other hand, Kick himself is way off base on several counts. His technique is pretty easy to decipher: Take a little known fact from the history books and blow it up into a massive "revelation" meant to shock and astound the reader. Examples include:  -- The police aren't legally obligated to protect you -- The Supreme Court is wishy-washy on the use of illegal drugs -- Many early feminists opposed abortion (for different reasons) -- One of the Popes wrote an erotic book -- Some environmentalists strongly support nuclear power  When you really dig into the details, you'll find that most of these claims either half-truths or overly inflated trivia. Nevertheless, "50 Things" is a great conversation starter and you can read the entire book in about an hour. Good for grins, if nothing else.  
 If you're like me & know absolutely nothing about Brazillian jazz (I bought this CD for the Sting track, really,) you're in for a treat!  Each track is a must-listen.  Vanessa William's "Love Dance", in particular, is so soulful & sensuous that it probably ought to have a warning label for minors.  This would be a good disc to put on for background music for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner, just to get things rolling.  'Nuff said ;- 
 "Prey" by Michael Crichton is a riveting story of survival for the characters. It also sheds light into the world of nanotechnology, which is unfamilar to much of the public and how it's qualities are becoming more like pandora's box. Once you pick this book up it is difficult to put it down. Each time I read this I feel like I'm reading it for the first time. If the right movie director got a hold of this, it would be a fascinating movie 
 I highly recommend this book to anyone who has tried a low-fat diet and failed.  This book goes into many specifics regarding EFA's, Omega 3s, 6s, and 9s and how eating the right fats can make you thin for life by jump  starting fat burning systems in your body and also by assisting the insulin  energy storage system in the body to help burn more fat.  It may be as  simple as eating the recommended foods and taking the proper supplements.   I really liked that this book wasn't just about weight loss, but overall  health and how the American diet has deteriorated so that it has promoted  many diseases in the last 10 years.  It's a wonderful change of pace from  your average diet, this is one that just might be livable for LIFE 
 If you have anything to do with your company's strategic positioning, resource allocation, and/or customer satisfaction, this book is something you will want to read.  As an entrepreneur and an MBA who has gone through the usual courses, I found the book refreshing, informative, and actually thoughtful about the real world rather than a book of formulations priming the sale for consulting services.  The knee jerk reaction towards customer service is to make sure everyone has a fabulous experience each and every time they interact with your company.  However, this book takes a more mature look at the kind of business you are in, the kind of strategy you have in the marketplace, the cost of the level of service that is appropriate to your competitive position, and who your customers really are (saying "everyone" is almost never a correct answer).    I loved the discussion of turning apathetic customers into advocates.  Advocates are customers that will actually go out and recruit for your company because of their enthusiasm for your products and services.  The authors are very deliberate in showing when this is strategy is effective and when it is a waste of money.  A very strong concept, I think.  We all know about the angry customer who goes on the warpath against you, but this is not about avoiding creating them, that is essential, but thinking about creating positive market buzz through your customers.  You may find that you can reallocate the service dollars you are currently spending more wisely, or that you are spending dollars to no real effect.  There is also very helpful information on how to do some competitive intelligence through listening to not only your customers, but what customers have to say about their experiences with your competitors.  The authors also show us how certain approaches to measuring customer satisfaction might not only distort the measure, but end up hurting the customer's experience.  They show how compensating employees for good scores can motivate them to help distort the scores by manipulating the customers.  There is also a good suggestion about how sophisticated customers might hold up the employee for extras in exchange for good scores.  The book is full of great real world examples and is written in a lively and convincing way.  VERY strongly recommended.  
 I think The Wild was one of the most underrated movies of this year- shame because it was SO funny!  The soundtrack is great too!    Track 1- Real Wild Child is performed by Everlife:  You can't help but start moving in your seat while driving along to this one.  Track 2- Good Enough by Lifehouse:  This group keeps coming up with the most unexpected but beautiful songs.  LOVE IT!  Track 3- Big Time Boppin' by Big Bad VooDoo Daddy: fun.  Track 4- Really Nice Day by Eric Idle: I enjoy listening to this because, now that I'm not watching the movie and can concentrate on the words I realize how funny it really is.  The rest of the tracks are musical scores from the soundtrack in the Disney tradition.  FUN!  
 This is another incredible book by Koontz which I found very difficult to put down.  The story revolves around Susan Thorton, waking in a hospital bed after a car accident, having been in a coma and suffering now from amnesia. The terror starts when she slowly encounters dead men from a horrifying incident 13 years earlier.  Each time Susan feels like she's starting to understand things, the rug gets pulled out from under her feet, and you're right there with her, baffled at each new turn, and feeling her terror with each encounter with the dead men. As she slowly questions whether she's slipping over the edge into insanity, you also question her sanity, and what is real and what is illusion.  Koontz's prose is excellent, truly putting us inside of Susan's head, making you wonder how YOU would react if put in the same situation.  An excellent read and a definite recommendation 
 in retalliation the the review thing at the top, since when was the Yam supposed to be a dance craze? when were any of their dances supposed to be a dance craze? No one else could danc elike that! anyway, I love this movie because it so funny. Ginger has incredibly funny running-amuck scenes with perfect timing. Her facial expressions arer superior. You also realize what a superb actress she was. This movie isn't the typical Fred/Ginger formula, but who minds a little change if it turns out as well as this 
 While I enjoyed Bel Canto, I much preferred the Magician's Assistant.  Although it moved slowly, I savored every word and did not want to put it down. I was not troubled by the unrealistic nature of some of the plot line, because I felt that the character development and inner plot line was so completely right and on target.  I read this book as more allegory than representation; I felt it to be a magical tale, which was in keeping with the story's characters.  I do not read fantasy literature as a rule, but I would if it were more like this book, subtle and understated.  Ann Patchett takes very real emotional states and captures the unreality and the magic in the experiencing of them.  A truly beautiful book 
 This is the first of Mr St. Aubyn's novels I have read.  I will now be seeking out the others.  The observational wit in this novel is perceptive, incisive and cruelly accurate. Because the satire is so splendid, narrative weakness made less of an impact on my enjoyment of the novel.  The strongest part of the narrative, for me, was that delivered by Patrick's son Robert: especially in the early part of the novel.  This novel should be read and enjoyed for the language alone. I expect that the underlying story makes more sense to those who are already  familiar with Patrick Melrose from the earlier novels.  Recommended.  Jennifer Cameron-Smit 
 This book had me on the edge of my seat!  Patterson's books usually read quickly, this one even more so due to the high drama and suspense.  I love that Alex is such the family man always protecting his loved ones and keeping them close.  I loved it!!!  Can't wait for the next one 
 This movie is really funny and Vince Vaughan is just great in it. It is good to watch when you need to laugh. 
 "Draconian Measures" picks up after where "Doom Brigade" leaves off; the story follows the adventures of the First Dragonarmy Engineers lead by Kang.  The draconians live in a world where they are pretty much hated by everyone, and the only thing these particular draconians want is a place of their own so they can live in peace.  Unfortunately, someone is out to completely destroy all draconians, and it is up to Kang and his men to prevent that.  "Draconian Measures" also introduces us to the female draconians whom Kang feels the need to protect at all costs. The females want to experience the world, but they have not been able to do that under the watchful eye of the commander.  This book is full of action and sure to please any fan of the Dragonlance world.  One thing that any D&D fans should note is that the statistics for the draconians are listed in the back of the book 
 If you're an Alice in Chains fan this short EP is essencial for you. There are some pretty good tracks on this. Even the hidden track is pretty "interesting". Anyway probably the best track from it is of course "Got Me Wrong". The other tracks are pretty good too. Here are some ratings...  1. Brother - 9/10  2. Got Me Wrong - 10/10  3. Right Turn - 8.5/10 4. Am I Inside - 9.5/10 5. Bonus Track 1  - 8.5/10  Overall: 91% A-   This is pretty much just a nice album to own if you enjoy the bands music or find it for real cheap somewhere as I did. It's good for what its worth being a short but sweet EP 
 A fundamental reference book for computational aspects related with matrices. Easy to read and very oriented to implementation 
 With the publication of Red Dirt Dunbar-Ortiz has made a major contribution to American biography. She has managed to write a Steinbeckian account of her childhood and youth in Oklahoma in the 1950s. The humanity  and oppression of poor white people is writ large here. Red Dirt is  informed by a feminist and class analysis but with great grace and touching  honesty. like Meridel LeSueur's novels of 60 years ago, Dunbar-Ortiz shows  the quotidian lives of working people who are ignored or riduculed by the  outside world. The book is clear eyed and rich in detail. I used the book  as a required text in a Sex and Gender course and it was a great hit among  my students 
 With a show as lighthearted and enjoyable as "Full House," its contains innocent entertainment that doesn't warrant many negative reviews. Unless you're a cynic who isn't really big on the fluff, it is safe to say that this series represents wholesome fun that we can all gladly revisit through the impressively well-paced DVD releases.   Although all the seasons of "Full House" (with the possible exception of their rough inaugural year) are pleasing to watch, it is this 6th season that got the show's message down just right. As I was looking through the season's episode guide prior to the release of this set, I realized that many of my very favorite episodes were filmed this year, and I believe that the chemistry between the characters was at its best.  A great deal happens for both the adults and the kids this season. To begin, single dad Danny Tanner finds his first true love (after his late wife Pam, of course) in Vicky Larson, who replaces Rebecca on "Wake Up, San Francisco" and initially puts Danny off with her no-nonsense attitude, but eventually wins his heart through her sweet and incredibly likable personality. Former high school dropout Jesse earns his diploma at last and team up with previous business partner Joey to host a local radio show. To add some sparkle to the mix, toddlers Nicky and Alex are now walking, talking, and bringing the classic baby fun to the Tanner household once again. Many fans will notice that the writers opted for a slight age jump with the twins (they were born in the middle of the previous season, which would normally make them less than a year old at this point), primarily to open up more storylines for young parents Jesse and Becky. That goal is certainly achieved throughout the season, as the boys definitely keep their parents on their toes. For proud papa Jesse Katsopolis, there is no road he won't take to give his boys a happy, fulfilling life--even if it means making some "minor embellishments" on the entrance application for Bouton Hall, a super-posh preschool in town! (Hey, if being "unbelievably trilingual" and having a father named "Ambassador Katsopolis" will help get you into a selective preschool, then why not add it to the application?)  Then, of course, there are the beloved Tanner daughters, played perfectly by Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. At 16, 11 and 6 years old, the girls are growing up quickly and receiving stronger plot material to reflect those changes. High schooler DJ returns from a summer program in Spain with new boyfriend Steve (aka the man with the iron stomach), and the entire season follows the classic ups and downs of her first love. Fifth grader Stephanie--with a new physical look and a perkier-than-usual personality--lets Kimmy Gibbler pierce her ears (now there's a scary thought!), pushes the romance with a fellow baseball teammate, and finds herself an unsuspecting recipient of some frightening secrets from a physically abused classmate (my personal favorite episode). In-between saying good-bye to her longtime friend Teddy and being crowned "Princess of the Day" during a family trip to Disney World, first grader Michelle gets the wrong idea about Steve's friendly behavior toward her and goes full-force with wedding plans (a road that big sister Stephanie went down herself just four years ago). Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are probably at their cutest here, and now they are fashion moguls who have officially reached billionaire status (all before their 21st birthday), it is nice to look back and enjoy their fresh and youthful days.  Bottom line, if you are a loyal fan of this series, this is definitely the DVD to pick up next time you are out shopping. With a $21.99 (approximately) price and episodes as great as the ones this season, you simply can't go wrong. Enjoy Season 6, and let's hope Season 7 is not too far behind 
 Catherine Coulter usually writes a good book, even if not always the greatest (notible exceptions are her latest historicals, which have been simply awful).  But what makes this book great isn't the book itself, but the audio.  Dick Hill consistently improves any story he reads, but in this case, he elevates it way above its written material.  In the 1st chapter, one of the characters is trapped in a cave.  The reading of the panic she felt made me feel like I was trapped too.  I listened to a similar type of scene read by Dick Hill almost 10 years ago while I was driving home.  By the time the hero got out of the cave, I had taken a wrong turn, and had no idea where I was.  Fascinating!    Take my advice.  Get this book on MP3, get an arm band for your iPod, and I dare you to even notice you're doing housework!  Keep an eye on the clock, though.  The hours fly by so fast you won't believe it.  Much better than sitting and reading a book, and a clean house to show for it!  If you've never listened to an audiobook, this is a great place to start 
 My 3 and half year old daughter and 18 month old son LOVE this DVD. Plus, being of the early Sesame Street generation, it is fun to hear some of the old classic cartoons.. 
 This is a good, basic solution to adding speaker zones to your home.  It's not much to look at, but does the job.  My biggest complaint is the appearance; otherwise, a good buy 
 excellent disclosure of the evolution of the understanding of God in early Israelite history.  book assumes a high degree of previous knowledge of early Israelite history within an historical / critical understanding of biblical studies.  If you are a "literalist," save your money ... you won't like it 
 This book was recommended to me by another golfer.  He guaranteed me that it would take strokes off of my game.  Well, I doubted this and made the purchase anyway.  After reading the book, I can state that he was correct in that my handicap has now gone down from a 5 to a 2.  This book doesn't teach you how to swing the club, but it teaches you how to mentally prepare yourself for a round of golf and how to practice.  I would recommend this book to any golfer no matter what age or handicap.  You won't be disappointed 
 this is one goofy movie about the world coming to an end and only our heros can save us.this time the earth's core has stoped spining and very soon the electromagnetic field of the earth will deteriorat and the earth will be no more.    sound like something you've seen before? sure a million times before,in a million other disaster movies,but a first rate cast and some great f/x sell this story and make it more fun than it should be.      first the cast hilary swank, aaron eckhart, delroy lindo,stanley tucci, and even alfre woodard show up. these are a list actors maybe looking for that hit money maker to boost their boxoffice draw,no matter because they make this super thin plot take on a life of it's own and draw you into the movie.    the f/x are great and if you let it, this super silly movie is fun in the way all the great old disaster movies were. give it a try 
 The character Jake on 2 1/2 men was asked by his father what the book "Lord of the flies" was about  and he repied, "a really big fly." Continuing with that thought, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is not about motorcycles and how to fix them. The book is an outstanding search of self and and the healing of a relationship. An old standard that holds up in time; it should be on a must read list with the best of literature. 
 I love this book and as a health educator, have recommended it for years.  If offers a wealth of practical ayurvedic knowledge to help women make intelligent health choices 
 Adentro is a punch to the heart - honest, intense, sensitive, emotional.  Its beautiful and poetic lyrics are complimented with magnificent melodies, and further complimented with perfect orchestrations.  Each song feels heartfelt - true.  Ricardo  Arjona's  artistic integrity is evident throughout the album, which has an organic yet sophisticated feel.    Before Adentro, I had never bought an album by Arjona.  I am now a fan.    Each song is a gem, but the gems among the gems are:  Para Bien o Para Mal - Listening to this song makes you feel like you are seeing your whole life in front of you, ready to move on - while you take some time to quickly scan the history of your love relationship for the last time.  You feel the resignation and lack of hope regarding the past along with a huge and unavoidable melancholy.  But you also feel the healing relief of getting out of something that was irreparable.  The song ends with a relieved "For better or for worst - it's over".  An undisputed masterpiece.    Pinginos en la Cama - Tori Amos or Nacho Cano (with Ana Torroja) could have easily written or sung the "piano version" of this song.  The song has a very "Jackie's Strength" feel, but is completely original in melody and lyric.  I cannot decide which version I like best.  The more acoustic version is amazing with soubtle New Order-like guitars, mixed with other more Spanish guitars, as well as keyboards and ingenious stings.   Bothe versions are great.  Very true and "right-on" regarding what mature relationships sometimes go through, and the potentially devastating, irrational, and paranoid jealousy that can come between two individuals.  I don't think this common issue has ever been expressed more eloquently or originally.  Arjona just has such a way to write, that for example in this song, you feel the love, the anger, the tediousness, the longing, the irony ---- all at once.  Amazing!  Mojado - A song with so much substance it will no doubt become a classic.  I can see someone like Chavela Vargas or Juan Gabriel singing it in the future.  The song's production and arrangement has just the right influence and blend of Tango, Flamenco, Tejano, and Pop.  The melody is perfect.  It's incredible!   Acompaname a Estar Solo - One of the most beautiful songs ever written.  Deep, mature, hopeful, yet humble.  So true to life and those times when we need to be introspective and take some time to be alone, in order to be able to face the future in a renewed and more positive way.  The melody and arrangement are grandiose.  Listen carefully and you will see that the song has an intricate pace that gives it an almost waltz-rock-pop feel.      Pa'Que - An outstanding melody with a piercingly sad lyric that effortlessly puts you in the shoes of a man who has lost his love.  You instantly feel the longing and emptiness, and can almost feel the house and the world tumbling down on you, as if you were who the song was about.  Heartbreaking.  If you listen to the bare melody of the song (especially the chorus - not just the piano part), you will realize it is very much like a Chopin piece.  Incredibly beautiful!      NOTE: Don't be put off if you are not into serious, slower songs.  There are quite a few happy songs that rock in Adentro.  I just love the more melancholic ones.    A brilliant album! 
 This book, among other books on MPD I have read, is probably the most interesting case. It really makes you think and appreciate what you have today.   The case of "Sybil Dorsett" is an incredible story of a girl who has Multiple Personality Disorder. This was brought on by horrific childhood traumas that her family afflicted on her. It is insane to think that anyone could do such a thing to a child, and to think that these kinds of things go on today. But, I digress.  For those who are interested in psychology, and MPD pick this book up. Or if your just looking for a really good read you will want to read this story 
 With a title like that, I couldn't resist purchasing this book.  This is the last book in the Southern Sisters mysteries by Anne George.  When the sisters attend a benefit performance, one of the Elvis impersonators is murdered onstage.  When the murder weapon turns up in Patricia Anne's purse, she and Mary Alice get more involved than they want to.  A page turner, its smooth and humorous writing keep you going all the way up to the well-done climax 
 I enjoyed this book so much!  It brought me right back to my childhood in Kansas. I could not put it down and made my husband listen to me read all the funny parts.  No other book has made me laugh out loud like this one did.  I cannot wait to read Haven Kimmel's next book.  
 If a classic is a book that everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read, then what do you call a book that everyone wants to quote but no one notices is not really relevant to much of anything? Sorry for the downer of an intro, but after hearing about Sun-tzu's The Art of War for so long, I didn't find the end product to be very enlightening. Sure, it was rather fun to read through, and the commentary told me a bit about ancient history in China, but ultimately it wasn't really a very life-changing read. A lot of it is repetitive. A lot is obvious: "Attack where he is unprepared; Appear where you are unexpected." And a lot is strange, like the six types of terrain: Accessible, Entangling, Deadlock, Enclosed, Precipitous, Distant. Geographers would point out that after reading the explanations, the grouping is very odd indeed. These descriptions do not exactly partition the landscape. And in case there's not enough confusion, the next chapter covers nine types of ground.  I don't mean to be too sarcastic. This should be an interesting book for anyone with an interest in ancient warfare or in Chinese history. As a strategy manual, it condenses a lot of useful hints in one place so the general is less tempted to forget important points. But this has been quoted from at length, and often appears to be some sort of ultimate guide to survival in modern times, in business for example. I think Michael Douglass's character in Wall Street was supposed to read it, though I barely remember that movie so I can't confirm this. The thing is it's really not like that. Much of the writing is irrelevant unless you happen to be in command of an ancient army (it doesn't have to be Chinese, though it would help). I suppose if I was transported back in time and found myself commanding the army of Wu against the army of Yue and could only have two books with me, this would be one (the other being a good Chinese dictionary).  In this version of the text, Sun-tzu's original text is presented first, and then is repeated verbatim with extensive commentary from historical writers, some contemporary with master Sun, and others in much more recent times. Unless you plan to study it carefully first and then read it a second time with notes, this means a hundred pages are extraneous. On the other hand, these commentaries are quite interesting, and can fill in a lot of the historical detail that is missing from master Sun's Spartan text. This, to me anyway, was more interesting material. Those kingdoms of that era were certainly living in interesting times. I don't know how many stories are real and how many are folklore, but they certainly are fun to read about. So buy and read the Art of War, but please do so for the right reason. I think anyone who claims this as his or her guidebook for life is just doing some historical and literary name-dropping. This is a book best appreciated on its own terms. 
 Ben Kaplan's book is not only useful and valuable, but enjoyable. This is something every college seeker should go through. Also read Norman Thomas Remick's "West Point" for a surprising (and enjoyable) eye-opener on what the full-scholarship West Point is really about. As a teacher and board member, I recommend both books. That's my best advice 
 Few questions are more relevant to our times than that of the resurrection (as if it had ever actually died!) of judicial torture. No longer safely able to stand tall and insular on its humanistic pedestal, America must face this issue NOW. People think of screws and boots and wedges and coals, but such medievalism is no longer remotely relevant: far more reliable (not to mention quicker) results are obtainable from pharmaceuticals (perhaps--like the death penalty--another issue where the Hippocratic oath is [?] at odds with Dr. Smith's specific actions today). Read, absorb, consider, conjecture, believe 
 In February 2006, the Financial Times of London reviewed “The Rise of American Democracy” by Sean Wilentz. In the review, Stephen Graubard of the FT states that “With Jackson, perhaps more than with the others, [Wilentz} revises and expands on the excellent findings of Arthur Schlesinger Jr, still the classic biography today, more than half a century after its original publication.” 
 Besides the wonderful recipes, this book is a pageant of Greek culture and an important historic document.  If you are interested in learning and experiencing the cuisine of any particular region of Greece look no further.  An excellent resource 
 This is a very good book that pulls no punches about Sade but does not condemn him either. It is a facinating story told through Sade's letters and it breaths life into this strange and brilliant man. The book does not enter into any of the complex theoretical debate that surround Sade so it can be read simply as a facinating story of a facinating man. But it is by no means simplistic and is a good primer for anyone who might want to enter the catacomb of Sade theorists. Read and enjoy. Ruminate and reflect 
 Last night was the season finale of ESPN's latest stab at original programming, Tilt. And if you didn't catch the promos where they contently mentioned it, Tilt is from the makers of Rounders. And if you didn't see the promos, you can tell just by watching the show with Eddie Cibrian doing his best Matt Damon impression. It almost seems that Eddie Towne could Mike McDermott before he gave up gambling. And they both were playing for revenge against the bad guy. I seemed to miss why Eddie, or Clark for that matter, held a grudge against the Matador, but that was one of many plot points I didn't pick up. But the big difference between the movie and show were the bad guys. Rounders had the cerebral villain in Teddy KGB where Tilt instead went for the mussel with Don 'The Matador' Everest. Both were perfectly cast. John Malkovich fit the intelligent poker player to a tee where Michael Madsen took being bad to an all new level pulling out all the stops to win short of cutting off some one's ear. In the token hot chick category, Rounders wins in a landslide. It was almost like they took the token hot chick from Rounders, gave her a couple whacks with the ugly stick, and then played her on Tilt. It was such a discrepancy, by the middle of the season they had to bring in a second token hot chick.  As a TV show, Tilt ran into some problems. As mentioned before, the show was had to follow at times and seemed to leave out some important information. They started off the show with an obvious swerve when the black guy attacks the white guy at the poker table. Looking back, the writer may have planned it to be obvious, as the Matador made reference to it after he turned on Eddie. Other burning question that were not answered or I just missed were what did the Iowa cop's brother do to get killed? Or why didn't Lowball threaten blackmail when he fired? Why did the Matador kill Skip himself while the tournament was going on? There were many holes that need to be filled. I even had to check out the website to see who killed themselves in the last episode.  Tilt did have many plot twists that I didn't see coming like killing Seymour off early. The big three being caught when the first tried to bring down the Matador. Clark's friend's secretary being FBI. And they save the best for last when it was revealed that the Matador threw the tournament. The final couple episodes was when the show as a whole pick up in the entertainment department with Norman Chad making he benign comments and the personal profile of the internet player who promptly got bounced in first round. Also, the last couple episode brought us an appearance of the Smoking Man playing a priest of all things 
 My Pre-schooler love hearing Mommy & Daddy "mess up" while trying to read this tongue twisting first reader book.  It's very funny - takes rhyming words and makes a game out of linguistic education.  Starts out with "Fox in socks" and romps through to end with "tweedle beetle puddle muddle fuddle duddle...".  The trip through is hilarious to kids and challninging to read to both kids and adults!  When you can read it fine - try it faster!  Hours of entertainment from three generations - fun to read or listen to it read... 
 Exciting and spell-binding. My favorite Grisham novel. I was sorry when it ended 
 This masterpiece gravely addresses the dangers of scientism and genocide while still maintaining Chesterton's trademark wit and humor.  Not only did Chesterton predict the Holocaust years before it happened, but he also provided a blueprint as to how such inhumanity could have been prevented.  This book both promotes enlightenment and sparks controversy 
 For a variety of reasons I thought it might be a good idea to pull my old copy of The Best and the Brightest from the bookshelf, dust it off and re-read it. A few things I had forgotten since reading this book in college. This is a big book, not only in length but also in breadth and scope, tracking U.S. foreign policy back to "losing" China to communism, the Korean Conflict, and the French Indo-China War -all leading to the first tentative steps of US involvement in Southeast Asia to finally the escalation of the 1960's. I was also surprised by the underlying contempt, (too strong a word?), the author had for the continuing set of decisions, (and decision makers), made to solve the Vietnam "problem" while only further compounding it. On my re-reading I was struck by the fact that many of the issues addressed in this book, (national security interests and intelligence, military technology, insurgency, imposed democracy, nationalism, leadership qualities) are still extremely relevant in today's world and in some cases still unresolved. This book was also a not so gentle reminder of what a capable journalist can synthesize during turbulent times 
 This book is a beautiful collection of deep and candid feelings of love and admiration. I hope to one day share this book with my future husband, wherever he may be. This is an inspiring book. An amazing feature is that writers, artists, composers such as Mozart, American Presidents and other famous people we incorporate ideas and generate thoughts about have part of their souls exposed to us in each page. We are all the same in God's eyes and feelings of love have always been. Nothing's new; only repeated and celebrated 
 Vincent Price is Edward Lionheart, an aging and failed Shakesperean actor who is driven to the edge (of a building) when he is denied a vaunted stage-critics award in this darkly hilarious classic.  Thought dead after an apparent suicide attempt witnessed by that circle of persnicketty critics - including the late-great Robert Morley - Lionheart survives and returns to exact a cruel revenge on his "enemies".  Using an actor's mastery of disguise and improvisation, and knowing of his enemies weaknesses, Lionheart takes each critic out one by one.  Resorting to ever elaborate means of murder - each suggested by works of Shakespeare - Lionheart deprives the British stage of one critic at a time, outwitting the surviving critics and the team of crack detectives sent to protect them.  If you're thinking "waituminit - this is like one of those 'Phibes" movies, you're not off the mark.  Unlike either of the Phibes movies, "Blood" is set in present day (okay, the 1970's!!) London and adds heaping spoonfuls of funky - witness Price as an afro-coiffed hair stylist!!  And speaking of spoonfuls, I'm not even going to say explicitly what devilish and ironic end he saves for Morley's corpulent character.  (The beauty of this flick is that you know what's going to happen - it's like a slow-mo car wreck).  Between this flick, the Hammer films and "Psychomania", my (then) young mind envisioned London as a city of monsters and psychotics in love with its reputation for the macabre - no less enjoyable because I actually caught this movie while vacationing there.  If you're a Price fan, or are just in the mood for some acid-tipped fun, this is your flick 
 This book is written after Ray's death so it chronicles his entire life. Based mostly on interviews by others and Ray's own autobiography it still gives a good overview. In the back is a great discography. Only thing missing is a little more critique on his personal life. His doings with drugs are not talked about that much and only his way with dealing with bandmembers can be seen as a darker side. Still a good effort and a worthy read 
 I couldn't believe how funny this movie was.  I LOVE IT!  This time, Scary Movie 3 didn't have to rely on stong language and sexual jokes to make it funny!  Hooray, they've finally figured that out! Sure jokes like that are funny for a little while, but after a while, get old.  This movie kept itself funny throughout.  The dvd has so many funny special features.  A great buy if you even somewhat enjoy spoof movies 
 I first got hooked on this CD last year although my dad had it for much longer than that. Before I listened to this cd my favorite White Stripes had always been Elephant but I immediately fell in love with this one. All of the songs are great and I even used "I'm Bound to Pack it up" as my senior song when I graduated from High School. This cd is amazing and I would definitely recommend it to any music lover no matter their genre. If there is nothing in this cd that you like rest assured there is something wrong with you 
 Lewis & Clark: From The Rockies To The Pacific is a gorgeously illustrated, in-depth account of the famous explorers' journey through the American West. The stunningly beautiful, full-color photography by Robert M. Reynolds of natural landscapes that Lewis and Clark traveled through, are presented side-by-side with a detailed reconstruction by Stephen Dow Beckham of the Lewis & Clark expeditionary journey that often quotes the travelers' journals. Lewis & Clark is an attractive, highly recommended coffee-table book for home, school, and community library American History collections 
 After hearing/seeing J-Live as part of the Okayplayer Winter Break, I decided to pick up one of his EP's.  I was pleasantly suprised at both the quality of the production (all his work) and the precision with which he rhymes.  He is clever, the rhymes are tight, and the songs seem to flow together.  This is the first J-Live cd I have bought, and it will not be the last.  My personal favorites are Add-A-Cipher (where he uses a numeric formula based on the number 5), Car Trouble (excellent use of metaphor, comparing his rap career to a cabdriver's) and Walkman music (head-nodding beat with smooth flow).  Since this is an EP, it is modestly priced, a good gamble if you are looking for an alternative to the current hip hop trends of violence, drugs, and money.  Hope you enjoy it

 Great resource - everything you need in one place. So much in here it is a must for evey Tech 
 The third season of ER is the best one yet.  It shows change racisium and people falling in love.  ER in my books will always be my favorite show for as long as it goes on 
 Edwin McCain plays intelligent pop music. He appeals to those with good music taste while playing basic structure acoustic pop songs. What is it? Maybe it's his voice, fabulous. Maybe it's his simple songs about the world, written with just enough creative spin to make the words interesting. But, whatever it is, he's great at it. As far as this particular CD, it's not going to bring him any more popularity. There's no standout single on it, which probably means no radio time for Edwin. But, if you enjoyed his past efforts, you'll find more of the same on this album. If you're a first time listener, pick up "Messenger. 
 This is an interesting book and is easy to read. As a non scientific person I was glad not to come across any heavy math or complex theories but the book is still very intelligently written.  The consquences of network theory look to be profound. In fact it seems to be a framework that you can use to think about many different issues and problems. So beyond the books examples of the network organisation of the Internet, cells, and so on you can use the idea of network theory and apply it to many other situations. I have found it quite useful in trying to understand certain economic effects in Europe, specifcally around the recent rise in Interest rates.  A good book indeed. It will be interesting to read about future findings on complex systems theory which is going to be built on top of this network theory 
 It doesn't take long to realize that Chloe and Jack are a mismatch from the get-go. A needy, high maintenance girl who blames most of her problems on the fact she is beautiful, pairs up with an eager, devoted man who feels he never quite measures up to his stunner of a wife.  The fireworks are inevitable, and the sparks do fly.    While Chloe pursues a high powered career in finance, Jack   plays the role of struggling writer.  His time at home allows him to become inappropriatly entangled with the odd residents of their apartment building, while Chloe pursues her own brand of misbehavior at the office.   Wonderful writing, remarkably well developed characters, a witty and believable plot, this novel would as others have mentioned, make a fine movie  It's impossible not to enjoy riding along with this train-wreck of a marraige as it hurtles toward it's satisfying crash ending 
 I love this book.  The pictures are wonderful, the recipes and techniques are easy to understand and follow and the food is delicious.  If I could only have one grilling cook book this would be it.  I even bought it as gifts for Christmas 
 The story may be fiction, but the premise is factual and what Dr. Cook tells at the end of the book is enough to raise the hair on the back of your neck.  In the 30s and continuing into the 70s the government experimented on a group of black men with the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments via the U.S. Health Dept., which is now the CDC. See BAD BLOOD by James Jones and THE TUSKEGEE SYPHILIS STUDY: THE REAL STORY AND BEYOND by Fred D. Gray who as a lawyer representing the Tuskegee Syphilis survivors sued the federal government.  As well, see Eileen Welsome's THE PLUTONIUM FILES: AMERICA'S SECRET MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS DURING THE COLD WAR.  If you believe Robin Cook's comments at the end of this book are fictional, think again!  It took Eileen Welsome 10 years to research and write her book and she received the Pulitzer for her work.  Robin Cook's information in this book should make you ponder what you sign when you visit a doctor's office...read it carefully and make sure you aren't another government experiment as there have been countless experiments besides the ones I've mentioned here 
 Translation is nasty work: long hours, little sleep, and just when you think you got it done you read it again and find the text completely unworthy of reading. I have little doubt that this was the process gone  through to hammer out a translation of one of the "must-reads" of  classical Japanese literature, and much credit is due for producing a work  a person can actually read without going mad. Some of the rhythm has also  been "translated" in, which gives those who cannot get at the  original a little of the "feeling" of the text. The only problem  that exists, save for an occasional error in interpretation (which even  Japanese researchers make, it seems), is one common to tranlsations of  classical Japanese texts: proper names and titles. The approach taken was  to translate them as literally as possible, but I fear that this goes to  knaw at the interest of the reader. As this is a major problem with  tanslation itself, and not just with this book, it can hardly be counted  against the tranlsator, but it shows a possible need for inovation in  future translations 
 I bought the "Caring for your Baby:Birth to One" when our son was born and referred to it all the time, so was pleased to find a similar book to take me through the Toddler years. The book is informative, gives practical advice and very useful information about common ailments and how to keep your child safe.   If you have one reference book on caring for your child I would recommend this one 
 Finally - a grill cover that actually stays on the grill and protects it in the worst weather.  The velcro straps keep it secure but it is very easy to remove when ready to use the grill.  This has to be the 4th or 5th grill cover we've tried and it will be the last one we try.  I would recommend this product to anyone investing iin a grill.  Why not spend a couple bucks more so that your $400 grill doesn't rust out in two seasons 
 The presentation is unique, the content loops around on itself, and the wide range of font styles and sizes occasionally distract, but there is probably no better way to look at the future than Enriquez's unapologetic, head-on style.   The future is not making any excuses for itself: it is roaring into town and anyone (be it individual, group, company, or nation) who fails to accept that fact is going to find themselves marginalized, irrelevant, and poor.  Enriquez narrows the future down to two fundamental principles: information systems and genomics.  Whoever masters these two concepts will be able to handle the future just fine; whoever ignores these will be left behind, without pity.    A concept that has already been hinted at in Alvin Toffler's _Future Shock_ and in Matathia & Salzman's _Next_ is the notion of the "Hockey Stick Chart."  To simplify this principle: in trending almost any human scientific endeavor, be it achievements in velocity, communications, memory storage, processing power, or genetics, the trends tend to creep up slowly the first few thousand years, start to climb in the last hundred, then shoot up dramatically in the last ten, in many cases increasing geometrically every 18 months or so.  The resulting graphic resembles a hockey stick in that it crawls along at a reasonably predictable angle (the handle) and then takes a near-vertical leap, in some cases straight up off the page (the blade).  Enriquez explores what he calls the "390 to 1" gap between rich countries and poor countries.  Part of this ratio stems from some countries' refusal to accept the world as having shifted to a knowledge-based economy -what one does with information and how it is distributed.  Countries that doggedly persist on sticking with the industrial manufacturing model may well be producing goods at record levels but are nonetheless poorer than they were ten years ago.  Enriquez points to Finland, Taiwan, and Singapore as particularly saavy examples of national economies that are actively embracing the so-called "Information Age" and stand to become extremely prosperous in the next decade; he conversely points to repressive governments like Burma (where state permission is required to own or access an Internet-connected computer) as a superlative example of poverty and near-irrelevance to the world.  The future can indeed be pretty intimidating to the keepers of the status quo...  Enriquez speculates as to whether future generations might be taught the extreme historical importance of the date February 12, 2001.  This is the date that the Celera corporation (with the use of what was at the time the single most powerful computer on earth -since supplanted) not only announced that it had completed mapping the entire human genome, but also posted the entirety of its findings on the Internet.  From that date, anyone on the planet with a computer and a web connection could view a comprehensive map of the human genome and make use of it for themselves.  (The American government agency known as the National Institute of Health [NIH] tried to insist that it had done likewise, and, worried about the competition, made a pre-emptive announcement that it had in fact mapped the human genome as early as August 2000.  This wasn't even close to true, but one can hardly blame government -as a rule it can't tolerate the idea that privately-funded corporations can do things faster and more efficiently.  What was really at stake was the notion of control -the Federal government would have retained control over the results and would pick and choose which findings would be made known and to whom.  To this day the official government stance is that it was in fact a "tie" between NIH and Celera.  And the Feds aren't the sole offenders -there were a lot of organizations racing to beat Celera to this particular finish line; at least one company tried to file suit in the International Criminal Court to block Celera from publishing its findings.)  Think on that: a map of the human genome, freely available to any and all who wish to make use of it.  From February 12, 2001 onward, it was now theoretically possible to engineer (or reverse-engineer) human life -to perform selective enhancements or selective deletions of specific characteristics.  Medicine could conceivably shift from the current "one size fits all" preventative approach to more of a custom-tailored individual regimen--medicines uniquely targeted to act upon a specific individual.  The sheer scope of this single breakthrough has yet to be measured, but one early indicator might lie in the number of genetic patents currently being applied for.  In 1998 it was a total of 300, in 1999 it was 340, in 2000 it was 381.  In 2001 it jumped to 8,070 --another hockey stick for the record-keepers.  All of this reinforces Enriquez's central point: those who understand and make use of the twin languages of binary and genomics are equipped to handle the future.  Those that are not (be they governments or corporations), will fade into irrelevance.  As a species we are very much on a new kind of threshold, one whose consequences have not yet been adequately thought through.  Some reactionary elements (like the current administration) are calling for selective moratoriums on this kind of research, some elements are even calling for it to be halted outright.  There is, however, no going back -the twin discoveries of genomics and instantaneous global communication have guaranteed that this is one genie that will never be stuffed back into its bottle.  "Let politicians and religious leaders rant and rave all they want," opines Enriquez.  "But it's coming, and those who would call for a return to some past standard are going to find themselves trampled."  Perhaps, he adds, one day they'll leave behind some impressive-looking ruins for the archeologists to pore over.  Enriquez then takes the reader further into these new discoveries and starts postulating nanotechnology (molecular computers) and the whole notion of organically-designed computers (the rationale being that, since binary code technology was necessary for the human race to decisively chart their own genetic code, that there must logically be a binary code equivalent to the language of genomics -and if that is the case, the genes should certainly be able to write and design their own programs.  Imagine computers able to grow their own connections, developing antibodies to fix their own routing and processing errors).  Long the provenance of science-fiction writers, the line between organic and artificial intelligence has never been more blurred than today.  Enriquez states quite definitively that there will be a day when that line is obliterated completely.    Enriquez makes no apologies for the odd font sizes or scattered appearance of the text (although he does make a concession to tradition in his endnotes); one gets the sense that he is continually trying to assert his "this is the way it's going to be, get used to it" argument even in the way he arranges the paragraphs across the page (even, on one occasion, in the shape of a hockey stick). 
 If you have not yet read The Talented Mr. Ripley and Ripley Under Ground (the weakest of the three first books in the series), I strongly suggest that you pursue those books before Ripley's Game.  There's a continuity of character development that you will miss otherwise.    The premise for Ripley's Game is the most interesting of the first three books in a series:  How will a dying man look at morality when he knows his days are numbered?  Ripley's Game has a second advantage over The Talented Mr. Ripley and Ripley Under Ground -- there are no plot devices where Ripley fools the same person over and over again with alternate disguises.  Another advantage over Ripley Under Ground is that Ms. Highsmith has a new character who can be totally developed in his many complex facets, much as Tom Ripley was so brilliantly in The Talented Mr. Ripley.    The title is particularly clever.  In one meaning, it describes one aspect of the plot.  Ripley has become interested in how an innocent man might be persuaded through careful psychological nudges to perform an anonymous murder.  In the other meaning, Ripley becomes the hunted, the game that killers seek out -- as in famous short story, The Most Dangerous Game.  There's a possible third meaning as well -- that Ripley is ready to tangle with a tough situation.    As the book opens, Tom Ripley's criminal friend Reeves has come up with an implausible idea -- encourage the Italian mafia to run itself out of Hamburg by starting a war between rival families.  To do this, Reeves needs an untraceable, innocent-looking killer who will quickly disappear.  Reeves spots the possible targets, but cannot think of anyone to do the killings.  Although Ripley has nothing at stake, the problem intrigues Tom.  He remembers a local owner of a framing shop, Jonathan Trevanny, who has an advanced case of incurable leukemia.  How might making the man afraid of dying sooner affect his willingness to kill?  The story proceeds from there with many twists and turns that are more realistic than in The Talented Mr. Ripley or Ripley Under Ground.    Before the book is over, you learn a lot about how people create their own situational morality.  You will find yourself surprised by the reactions of Ripley, Trevanny and Trevanny's wife.  It makes for very interesting reading.  I especially enjoyed seeing Ms. Highsmith go back to do more with developing new dimensions of Ripley's character.    The book's main problem with the book is that it usually moves at the wrong pace.  The leisurely, untroubled sections are developed at about the same pace as the dangerous action sections are.  As a result, the book feels like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is being played at the exact same average tempo throughout.  The contrasts don't work as well with such an approach.  In addition, the leisurely parts are too fast and the action parts are too slow.  The Boy Who Followed Ripley comes next in the series.    After you finish this book, take time to honestly think about what you would do if you had been Trevanny.  It makes for a series of fascinating speculations to consider.        
 Dean Koontz writes a tale of deeply penetrating detailed intrigue ... mind-blowing experiences and events occur to various characters in the book which are tied together so intricately that the book is spell-binding from start to finish.  Martie Rhodes has accompanied her good friend, Susan Jagger to the psychiatrist's office for over a year. Susan has had recurring nightmares about her ex-husband entering her apartment at night and doing inexplicable things. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Ahriman is a famous author of top selling 'self-help' books along being published in peer-reviewed journals for research in his field of expertise. His kind considerate manner balanced well with his superb credentials and unsurpassed reputation. Lately, Martie has begun experiencing unsual mental stress symptoms herself. She couldn't look herself in the mirror without thinking of harming herself and began experiencing intense fear when she handled sharp objects ... part of her knew this behavior was abnormal yet she couldn't stop the thoughts from arising at times. She was considering visiting Dr. Arhiman herself to help control this new onset of chaotic thinking ...  Her husband, Dusty, a painting contractor had just saved Skeet, his brother, from jumping off a roof and killing himself. Skeet had a background of psychological problems from his youth. He had been a "babe magnet", a handsome young man but his negligent eating habits made him look like a gaunt shadow of himself... Dusty had him admitted to a local psych facility ... where it turned out Dr. Mark Ahriman was a silent partner. In the facility, Dusty was exploring his brother's problems and was looking through his belongings. He came upon a phrase in a book which he read outloud and discovered ... put his brother in a trance. Essentially his brother followed his commands and answered questions in a distant voice with no recall of the event after he fell asleep ...  Susan Jagger sets a trap to prove once and for all whether Eric her exhusband is paying her visits at night while she is asleep ... She shares none of the details of these nightmarish events with Martie ... As Martie and Dusty settle down for the night they discuss the days events, with many of its peculiar aspects. Susan tries calling Martie who does not pick up the phone. When Martie does not hear from Susan for over 24 hours, she becomes suspicious and goes to her apartment. Susan is discovered dead - an apparent suicide. But was it? Dr. Mark Ahriman reassured Martie that Susan was doing splendidly and improving ... He felt she was near a breakthrough and could likely be cured? What happened to Susan to make her kill her self?  The answers to these questions are explained in a twisted tale of intrigue and mystery. Dean Koontz uses normal events and unusual ideas and concepts based on scientific research which is exaggerated in his imagination to build a suspenseful murder mystery with complex underpinnings of winding labyrinthine paths. Reading this book is a thrilling roller coaster ride ... There are many ups, downs and hair-pin turns at the most unexpected moments. This is another exciting book by a master author who is tops in his field ... Read and enjoy. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)  
 Women was my introduction to the work of Charles Bukowski. A friend owns a copy and let me borrow it. After reading only a few chapters I was so interested that I purchased Women and Notes of a Dirty Old Man on Amazon. Some of the other reviews dismiss the book as pure vulgarity and criticize the repetitiveness of the narrative, i.e. Henry Chinaski drinks, writes, meets a woman, uses her, and moves on. I find Bukowski's descriptions and writing style refreshing. He is honest and direct and refuses to mince words.  The plot may seem a bit cyclic for the first half, but toward the end I felt like Bukowski began opening up more to the reader, wondering about the reasons for his actions and examining his addictive-like relationship with women. We all have flaws and women seem to be Bukowski's downfall. Self-improvement rarely succeeds on the first try, and Bukowski's repeated episodes with women just point out how big of a hurdle he has to get over in his life. At one point in the narrative, one of Chinaski's friends asks him if he was ever in love. He says something to the effect of, "Yes, and I was miserable." Chinaski's womanizing may just be the expression of his fear of falling in love again. He was broken once and wants to redeem himself by never letting another woman break him.   Just as the quote that precedes the first chapter says, "Many a good man has been put under the bridge by a woman." --Henry Chinaski   *Note*: When describing the narrative I used the names Bukowski and Chinaski  interchangeably. Chinaski is in fact the narrator and protagonist, but  the work is very autobiographical. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.         
 Unlike the two reviewers below, who are from Trinidad, I cannot speak to this novel's authenticity. However, as a middle-aged white American male, I can affirm it's universality and greatness. This unique and beautifully  written novel took me into an alien world and made it real and  comprehensible. The characters are memorable and  specific to their  environment, yet universal in their emotions. I identified with so many of  these Trinidad slum dwellers. The novel is funny, touching, sad, uplifting.  Though very different, it's emotional impact on me was equivalent to  "Catcher in the Rye" and "To Kill A Mockingbird." I  will never forget the people I met in this extraordinary novel. If you wish  to be transported and transformed, be sure to read it. I can't recommend it  too highly 
 I remember watching Martin Yan on television when I got to stay home from school.  He was and still is totally amazing.  I bought this cookbook, paid full price and would do it again in a heart beat.  The recipes WORK, the photographs are beautiful and Mr. Yan's personallity shines through in the descriptions and informatin pacted into this wonderful book.  People into cooking now, talk about how Emerile made cooking popular.  To these people I exclaim, you must have never seen Marin Yan cook.  With this book, anyone can successfully cook chinese food and do it well.  Mr. Yan is truly an excellent teacher, sharing the chinese culture with us through his wonderful food and personallity.  For those of you who don't really like to cook but like to buy cookbooks (a few of whom I know) this is a great book just to read.  I can only name a few cookbooks that I have actually sat down and read.  Usually I use a cookbook for the recipes and ideas. This book I will pick up to read like one would a novel. Of course as I am reading I am getting hungry and trying to decide what night to cook chinese, but it is a small price to pay for such enjoyment 
 Reading all of these '1-star' reviews tells me that the people giving them no SQUAT about what 'hip-hop' is supposed to be. That includes AMAZON.com who I have to say knows nothing about the art form. That's not to offend them but like almost ALL so-called critics, they always fall short of the mark and need to just stick to their computers, desks, business suits with their suspenders. Get a clue, people.  This isn't a bad album at all. It's not meant to be N.W.A. Public Enemy, Run-DMC, or KRS-ONE. It's not N'Sync either. I don't hear any 5-part harmonies here and the songs actually take it up a notch over his debut. I'm not a big fan of Nelly but the overall quality of the recording is actually good. The songs are fun. I would say it's light-hearted hip-hop which isn't a bad thing. Will Smith (Fresh Prince) makes lighter records than Nelly and "the man", as one uninformed interviewer calls it, actually thinks 'Big Willie' is what hip-hop shouldn't be about because "the man" would rather hear rappers killing everything moving on their records so, learn something about the art form before criticizing what you know NOTHING about.   It's a good album and is worth the money. He came into the industry with a style all his own and there's nothing wrong with it. Sometime, it even beats listening to angry so-called thugs and gangstas'. As for almost all the reviewers with the low ratings, they're more than likely the feeble-minded wanna-bes that 'diss' this CD because they can't sit in their homes and mimb the words while throwing up limp-wristed gang signs they learned while watching 'hood' movies on TV.  But anyway..... 
 As an avid country music fan, this cd is now at the top of my list of cds to listen to at home and in the car.  
 As other reviewers have written before me, this book surely has an historical value to it. It allows the reader to have a quick glance to a particular historical moment of typography in pre-WWII Germany, written in a Marxist tone. Also, the layout of the book is a beauty in itself, with its glossy paper and sans-serif Futura font. But that is pretty much it, unless you want to read it because you are a student in History of Typography. Do not expect to learn basic or advanced typographic elements here. If you want that, read "The Elements of Typographic Style" by Robert Bringhurst instead 
 This is a historically important film in both the SF genre and in film itself.  It is certainly one of the best examples of what CAN be done when a little effort is put into a project, both in terms of the story execution, and the ideas that lay the foundation for the afterthoughts that the viewer takes away.    Witness the incredible depictions of the remaining Krell artifacts, the idea of the "plastic educator", the "brain booster", etc.  Marvel at the beautiful set pieces.  To be sure, they aren't "realistic" but, as another reviewer points out, they are "dreamlike", and they add another dimension of fantasy to the atmosphere.  Overall, just enjoy this great classic for what it is - thought provoking, intelligent, and fun.  All ages will enjoy 
 The story of Ethan Frome is a wonderful story that pretty much everyone can relate to. A love for something, or in this case, someone, which cannot be proclaimed due to responsibilities that society has outlined. This book delves deep into the meaning of these two ideas, Passion vs. Responsibility and actually makes you rethink both of them.  When I first picked up this book, I figured it would just be a quick easy read. This was true for the most part in that it was a quick and easy read, but the way Edith Wharton has been able to take everyday simple elements and turn them into something so much more was simply extraordinary. I soon found myself not being able to put the book down until I had finished the entire thing and I was very pleased with the roller coaster of emotions this book presented me with. Once you start reading, you actually feel as if you have taken the place of Ethan Frome and are always just waiting to see what will happen next. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a nice easy read or for anyone interested in symbolism because there is plenty of it. Ethan Frome is simply put... a fantastic story and a must read 
  We are a group of 5 night shift nurses that love this sweeper. It did a great job cleaning up our nurses station. We used this product in many ways testing it to see how well it really did work. It picked up not only popcorn, but the kernels too.It also picks up paper hole punch messes, and scraps of paper in no time. it is light weight enough for anyone to use and stores well.We had an older sweeper that took alot of time to use and still left a mess behind. Now it is nice to pull the sweeper out and be done without a lot of bending over to pick up the pieces the sweeper missed. Its great and we recomend it to others, in fact most of us have bought it for our own homes.    
 To settle a dispute over the ownership of a land, a large legal firm approaches Animators, Inc. Their request is very specific: raise the corpses and determine which family is the rightful owners. It sounds rather easy except that the corpses are at least two-hundred-years old; a job that only the best animator could possibly do.   Enter our heroine Anita Blake. As usual, it wouldn't be a normal day for her if she only had one problem to deal with. While inspecting the land, she gets a call from the police asking for her opinion on three gruesome murders. However, it doesn't stop there. Shortly after, she is called to investigate the murder of a dead girl who was obviously slain by a vampire. In just a few hours in Branson, Missouri, Anita realizes that they are dealing with something more sinister; something that would require the help of the Master of the City--her boyfriend, Jean-Claude.  Welcome to the world of Anita Blake--animator, necromancer and vampire-slayer extraordinaire. She is tough, cynical, and witty, and possesses a warped sense of humor. While she is ruthless when it comes to annihilating the monsters, you just can't help but love her. Hamilton has created such a fantastic character and storyline that one can't help but be enticed and be drawn into Anita's world. She knows how to blend mystery, supernatural theme, romance and humor. She also has a real talent for seducing the readers by giving just enough hints of what to expect in the future, such as revealing a teeny weenie bit more about Anita's real powers or divulging something interesting about the other central characters, or taking her relationship with Jean-Claude one step further, just enough to whet your appetite. And it works! Because if it doesn't, I wouldn't be reaching for the next book as soon as I get to the last page of one.  BLOODY BONES is the fifth book in the series. While this volume can stand alone, it is worth reading the first four books to give you a richer understanding of the characters and their lives 
 One thing to make apparent for thoes that might have been reading the other reviews here. Is that people are assuming there is one version of a myth and that it is fact and the be all end all of it. Which its not. The Greek Myths were all originally oral work. Even that of the Illiad and the Odyseey started out as oral work. As time goes one the myths had changed before they were put into written form and standarized. I think Graves does a wonderful job it trying to present a complete picture of something that has been so effected by time, he does not attempt to give you one account of the myth and leave it as that is the only right view. He does present the different views that were held, and he documents where everything came from clearly so that if like myself your a scholar you can pick up a copy of Metamorphisis or the Theogony and find the reference in its original format/language.   If you want a clear overview of the Greek Myths or just a complete view of them I would pick up this book. (Don't be scared off by the word overview...unless you want to read about 3000-4000 pages this is one of the most completle listings there is). I would highly suggest this book to anyone interested in Greek Mytholog 
 The four young mages are grown...but their time apart seems to have created a rift between them.  Each one has a secret they are unwilling to tell the others.  One fears letting the others see the true horrors of a fruitless war.  Another fears being rejected out of jealousy for powers they do not all share.  The betrayal of a hero and his death torments one mages soul.  And finally, the last mage does not want to share the memory of a violent execution.  These secrets kept them from each others minds. Word from Sandry's lands up north compel her to journey there to settle matters.  Her siblings go along as court/guards/and councel.  Though they fought often the dangers of the imperial court forced them to unite and to look at their hearts.  By pairs did they re-unite.

 Boy or girl, young or old, readers will love reading about Tiger Woods' inspiring rise to the top of the golf world. Overcoming racism, economic hardship, and personal limitations, Tiger leads the pack at an incredibly young age. My 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter and I read this together, and we were all equally enthralled and inspired by Tiger's story. It was accessible without being overly simple. We're looking forward to reading more entries in Matt Christopher's biography series. 
 There have been a number of knitting history books but Bishop Rutt's History of Hand Knitting is perhaps the most readable. This new edition by Interweave Press has a lot to offer anyone interested in textiles and knitting. From nalbinding (a Scandinavian netting technique) to to the flourishing of knitting as a guild in the Middle Ages, and later the development of silk handknit stocking that replaced cloth leggings in Elizabethan times, the history of knitting is a fascinating story of craft combined with economics. This is one of my favorite knitting history books and I am pleased it is back in print 
 This is in my opinion, not one of Faulkner's best books. It is, however, a beautifully written story of generations of a single exstended family. Because the book is written in that it is made up of several short stories instead of chapters, the story can seem fragmented at times, leaving you wondering what happened to the characters in the last piece. It is difficult at times to keep characters straight, but the best story in the book is by far "The Fire in the Hearth"  which follows the Lucas and Molly, this part of the book is often overlooked in the shadow of the long and tedious "The Bear"- but should be read and enjoyed. Overall the book is a good introduction to Faulkner, but may be a challenging read to some 
 Bad Habits is one of Barry's funniest books. A collection of columns that were written before he moved to Miami and lived in Pennsylvania ("Moo"). The book is divided into a few sections. Health,  Government, Media, ect. The government section is severely outdated, it was  written in the Reagan Administration. But it doesn't make it any the less  funny. The media and health parts are a blast. Whether Barry is talking  about exercising, or Your Local News Station, Barry proves he is truly the  master of his trade.... Whatever that may be 
 I wanted a basic overview text on Greek and Roman civilizations.  Luckily I stumbled upon this book by Connolly and Dodge.  The book is terrific.  The layout is excellent.  The writing is succinct and the text moves along smoothly.  I now have a basic knowledge of Greek and Roman eras.  I got a lot more out of this book by also reading Edith Hamilton's The Greek Way.  However, I must confess, this book is far more interesting and keeps one glued.  A joy to read.  Very highly recommended 
 If you're a salesperson and need to improve your skills, this book will do the trick. I found this book to be easy to read and packed full of sales techniques I could start using right away. Brian Tracy's The Psychology of Selling is a "must read" for any person serious about making it in the field of selling 
 This is an awesome book written by Max that is heart felting and reminds me that my imperfections are really God's prefect design for me. I currently own five of his books including "You Are Mine", "Because I Love You", "Just The Way You Are"(which made me cry!), "Tell Me The Story", and "Tell Me The Secrets". Yes, I am a big fan of his children's books and it all began with the first book of his I've ever read "You Are Special". I was touched ever since and it touched my students, my husband and every other person I'd share it with. The best part of owning these books is that I get to share them with everyone I know. I was a 3rd grade teacher and love these inspirational stories that share the messages of hope and love. Best of all, it really doesn't matter what religion, age, sex you are to enjoy these books. Once you get one, you'll probably want them all! 
 Kerouac's Big Sur, written after his mega-success with On The Road, could be argued as a very dark, depressing read. On the contrary, I found it very revealing about one of my favorite writers, and his frame of mind at the time.  Given the opportunity to seclude himself from his friends, fame, and drinking to excess in the cabin of a friend, Kerouac sinks into a sort of paranoia and anxiety, and finally gives in to his impulse to return to 'civilization'....and then proceeds to invite a group back to the cabin, leading him to realize that his most recent affair was with a girl he didn't actually love.  The most fascinating aspect of this novel, to me, is not the horrific volume of drinking Kerouac does at this stage of his life, but in the fact that though he was put off by his fame, and being dubbed 'the King of the Beats', and at being hounded by ardent fans who wanted to merely be in his presence...he couldn't stand the isolation.   Also of interest to me was the 'honesty' he put into his feelings about the actions of his fans...they say 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery', but Kerouac seemed to think just the opposite...and all but told his fans/readers to 'get a life' in several passages of the book.  Those in his industry, who rely so heavily on fan-support rarely ever are so vocal about their distaste for those same fans, without a severely negative impact on their sales.   An excellent read, though if you are looking for 'uplifting', spiritually awakening wisdom from the 'king of the beats', look elsewhere. This book is a downward spiral into the darker recesses of Kerouac's alcohol-induced delirium 
 An amazing insight into the lives of two of America's great artists of this century.  Thanks to the fine research of the author and the fact that so many important people in the lives of O'Keeffe and Stieglitz  corresponded by letter and, more importantly, saved the letters, we are  able to share many moments in their personal and professional lives in NYC,  at Lake George and in New Mexico. Their psychological development over time  and the effect of that on their work and their relationship is fairly mind  boggling. One problem, the author never really explains what it is about  Stieglitz that makes O'Keeffe love him and keeps her tied to him 
 this is a good product.  It effectively cleans water of microbiological contaminants (including viruses) through a layered filtration system and iodine-releasing resin (and among the only EPA certified bottles to do it). It is not heavy and leaves the water with a slight iodine taste (much more subtle than using iodine tablets). Each filtration system, which screws into the inside of the water bottle, lasts about 26 gallons (about 100 liters) after which you have to replace it, costing about US$22.   I have been using the bottle in rural peru and have had no problems. I would recommend this product for anyone venturing into areas with unknown water sanitation, all you need is the bottle and a puddle, stream, river, etc. I don't know its results against pesticides, arsenic, lead, etc. but for short term use this is a great product 
 DJ Quik and the Krew just keep 'em comin. AMG did a fantastic job on this album, just like he has done in the past. With people like Mausberg, SugaFree and Dj Quik workin on something you can't go wrong. May Mausberg rest in peace. Everyone should pick this one up, it is well worth it 
 I really love Bones.  It has everything: suspense, drama, humor, pretty people, fun storylines.  I have yet to miss an episode, and even into Season 2 this is probably my favorite.  It adds depth to all of the characters.  Also, the winter holidays are my favorite time of year.  I like holidays that are about what is good in the world.  Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day.  I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way.  Buy, watch it, love it.  But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone.  So moving, great performances by the whole cast.  Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here.  David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments.  Touching, poignant moments.  This really is the best of what is great about Bones 
 ...WHERE DO I BEGIN..THIS BOOK WILL MAKE U LAUGH,CRY,GET EXTREMELY ANGERY THROUGH OUT THE CHAPTERS! This book was GRRREAT!You will not be dissapointed, its hard to give a review without giving it away because I also have read the sequal!Enjoyed it as well!You will find yourself wanting to reach out and help Annette throught her life exsperiences-read and enjo 
 This is a great book. Peter David really put me in the book!  I would recommend this to any one who can appreciate a true Sci-Fi and Star Trek book. But it has moderate cusing and adult content 
 This 90-minute satire on politics in the age of mass media zips along for 75 minutes at a breakneck pace, sharp and witty and full of great performances, especially Hoffman as a film producer underappreciated by everyone but himself and Willie Nelson as a slightly muddled country singer. The commentary on war as an Administration tool for distraction has become even more meaningful since the film was made in '97. Though it gets a little off the rails in the last 15 minutes, "Wag the Dog" is great fun, and it's starting to look like it'll be Levinson's last great film. My favorite lines --  Hoffman: Anybody know anyone who's ever eaten in an Albanian restaurant? DeNiro: Is there such a thing as an Albanian restaurant? Hoffman: Has to be. They have to eat, right 
 I wish I had this in college...it's an indispensable reference for anyone reading the history plays, and it's a clear and engaging read 
 Well first and foremost, i'm from the south( Alabama that is ) and I really can say this is one of the albums that put the south where we at now. I'm not saying this is the greatest or one of the greatest albums lyrically but at the same time 95% of the songs on this album is catchy. People hate on the south  because of what we bring to the table. Thats pure realness. I see a lot of comments about we're too crunk or theres no lyrics, well, first the whole south is crunk, and if you want lyrics we got other rappers for that, Eightball@ MJG /T.I./ Scarface/ UGK/ Outkast/ Jeezy, anyways these rappers talk about how we doit in the south, not anywhere else, so love it or leave it. And for all you haters out there. If you hate our music so much, stop buying it and playing it in your whips  
 Documentary manages to capture the history, spirit, beauty, and danger of the world's highest peak.  Would have receive 5 stars were it not for the slightly haphazard story line, however the film is visually stunning and this alone is worth the purchase price 
 I am ever grateful that this book was recommended to me.  It has changed my life in many ways and helped to send me on my spiritual journey.  I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking spiritual development 
 It's no wonder so many of Elmore Leonard's books make it to the big screen and Get Shorty is no exception.  It's a great read that makes you sad that it has to end, like a best friend who just couldn't stay.  But it's not just his insightfully funny, yet touchingly tragic stories that draw readers in so earnestly.  It's his ability to reach down inside himself and draw upon the everyman we all hope to be in our next lives.  And it's not by accident that Elmore's protagonist, Chili Palmer, is of the mold that every lead actor wants the public to perceive them to be.  Every actor knows playing characters like Chili can and does make an actor millions. But Elmore doesn't stop there.  His villains, like Ray Bones, are drawn from muck and grime often scraped out of the gutter and splattered on the face of their unwitting victims, and yet any character actor from around the world would give his left nut to call their name his own.  A true homage to one of America's greatest character writers, and my home town hero, Elmore Leonard.  So, if you like great people, in cool stories where the good guy isn't always an angel, then Get Shorty will grab you by the short hairs and take you there.  Just remember that all great books must come to a great end.  Karl J. Niemiec - author of Mammoth Towers Mysteries (Apartment 101) 
 This is leaps and bounds better then ElectricLarryLand, which isn't   difficult.   There are a few songs on here that doesn't work, but most of them are great listens. Sure it is different then their fantastic early albums, but do you really want them to rerelease the same music over and over.  It is very different in some ways then what you expect for the BS. Yes, it is very techno-y, but they have done pop and danceable tracks before, Dum Dum for one. Compare any of their albums, they are all very different from each other. They have never liked rehashing their music, or standing still. This follows that tradition, and the fact that the music and lyrics are enjoyable makes this a great album 
 Call it what you like, but this book put itself right back into my hands at a time in my life when I really needed it. While all around me were into some really fanatical religionism and others were just angry atheists trying to get me to agree with them, this book found its way back into my life and gave me back hope and taught me how strong love is in our lives. I bought this book over 5 years ago for my grandmother, who was a voracious spiritual reader and had shared many books with me. I had not even remembered buying it for her.  She recently went into a retirement home and had wanted me to have all her books. My aunt started sending me one box at a time, and this book was in the first box that arrived and was on top.  I took it out with some curiosity but had not remembered it at all. Inside I had written a note to my grandmother that I thought it was a book she would love. I started to read it one night late, and it became my friend for about 2 weeks. Every night, I would take it out when the house was quiet and read it until very late.  It began to change me. I would go to sleep at night, thinking about the fact that my father was not really gone, and that my  other grandmother was still close by. I lost my father in 1990. I lost his mother in 1992, and my other grandmother (the one I had given this book to) was close to death. The grief and fear just overwhelmed me to the point where I couldn't understand anything at all. I was also struggling with the impending death of a little dog that I have loved more strongly than any other pet. This book helped me to relax and know that I'll see her again, and that I'll get to be with her always. I just couldn't fathom the kind of God my daughter was preaching to me..one that punishes us severely for making mistakes when we don't understand what the consequences are or we're just weak. I couldn't understand why if He loved us so much - would he condemn us to a fiery place where we could never be near Him again. After all, those of us who have had children who stomped on us have forgiven everything and loved them with all our hearts. If we have loved this strongly and forgiven so readily, why couldn't a God?  His observations in the chapter about pets really gave me peace that Katrina and I won't be separated.  While writing this review, I never meant to get into religion or a debate, so please don't take it that way. It was the only way I could describe something magical that happened to me and hope it helps someone else who is going through something similar. After all, we are all so much alike in many ways.  Thanks so much, George, for having the courage to write the book that brought me out of dark grief and fear.  
 My wife and I first purchased Calphalon Contemporary Nostick cooking gear about a year ago.  We both love them.  Not only do they cook evenly and quickly, but they are easy to handle & store.  Additionally, clean up is easier then anything we have previously owned.  We purchased some additinal items through Amazon, and received them in less than 5 working days.  We are thoroughly impressed with both Calphalon and Amazon 
 Among its many other delights, this book has my favorite "butler-narrator" in all of fiction, Gabriel Betteredge.  Betteredge's insights into the British upper classes are downright hilarious.  Take, for example, the passage in which he describes Miss Rachel and Mr. Franklin's newfound passion for decorative painting.  After noting that the lives of the British gentlefolks are spent, for the most part, "in looking about them for something to do," he goes on:   "Nine times out of ten they take to tortuing something or spoiling something -- and they firmly believe they are improving their mind, when the plain truth is, they are only making a mess in the house.  I have seen them . . . go out, day after day, for example, with empty pillboxes, and catch newts and beetles and spiders and frogs, and come home and stick pins through the miserable wretches, or cut them up, without a pang or remorse, into little pieces. . . . . As for Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel, they tortured nothing, I am glad to say.  The simply confined themselves to making a mess; and all they spoilt, to do them justice, was the panelling of a door."   Betteredge has the loyalty of all good British butlers, but it's a tongue-in-cheek sort of loyalty.  At one point, the main detective in the story makes a case against Miss Rachel.  I love Betteredge's response, in which he advises the reader to "cultivate a superiority to reason":  "It was downright frightful to hear him piling up proof after proof against Miss Rachel, and to know, while one was longing to defend her, that there was no disputing the truth of what he said.  I am (thank God!) constitutionally superior to reason.  This enabled me to hold firm to my lady's view, which was my view also."  The witty narrative voices and the whodunnit plot make this a fun and fast read 
 I knew nothing about Daniel Silva when I bought this.  He happened to be one of the featured authors at my local Borders location so I figured I'd give it a try.  Wow was I surprised.  Gabriel Allon is a great character and he's not made into a superman of sorts...he's very human.  I'm glad I stumbled onto this series and plan on reading all of them 
 This book is just what I wanted and needed. The exercises are interesting and I am fairly painlessly learning to read music. The technical barriers are fewer than they were when I started. I am slowly beginning to think "music" a bit as one learns to speak and think in another language ie at first slowly and haltingly, putting individual bits and pieces together, moving on to the musical phrases of this book ie first sentences.  When I get to the etudes in the back it is my hope that I will move on to the equivalent of musical paragraphs. So far it seems to be working.  I believe that this is an excellent book of exercises which are well tailored those interested in improving their technique, their fund of musical ideas, and the overall smooth transition to thinking in terms of those ideas while also being able to play out those ideas more freely on a guita 
 I, personally, loved this book.  This book showed everything about beauty pageants, from dresses to costs.  You see what really goes on in the person's mind.  I thought this was an excellent book and recommend it for any age readers 
 I have just finished reading all four books in this series and loved them.  Once in awhile we find books that are treasures to read and these are it!  Whether Swedish or not, these books tell the story of the hardships and simple, poor live the immigrants to our country lived.  Certainly worth the time to read.  I have recommended them to many people 
 I first read this book about five years ago when I was yearning for SOMETHING in my life, but didn't know quite what. Cecile seemed to have read my mind and outlined the very needs of someone caught up in the "junk" of life -- both mentally and physcially -- and gave solid ways of untangling one's life. If you heard of "voluntary simplicity" but haven't yet caught the wave, this book is a wonderful introduction to the concept and will lead you on to learn more. You will see your life in a new light after the seed of simplicity is planted in your mind 
 This is a great book for Christians and non-Christians!  I finished it and immediately started it again.  Ms. Lotz uses the Gospel of John to help us gain insights about Jesus.  The book really convicted me to establish a  daily time of prayer, study and meditation with Jesus. It is clear Ms. Lotz  is a very gifted Bible  teacher!  God Bless He 
 C.D. in excellent condition, arrived soon after order.  OH! Played at full volume--made me long to see the movie again.  May just do that.  The other reviewers complimented the movie orchestration and sound track--they  were right.Nothing like Leonard Bernstein, Marnie Nixon, et.al 
 I first came across the title last year watching the TCM channel early one morning. Suddenly it appeared in the middle of some end of the movie features. It was absolutely delightful. I bought the book for my nephews, but could not find it on video. For almost a year now, I've been trying to get anyone's attention, including the author's, TCM and some animators. It was supposed to be shown Feb. 14 on TCM, but I didn't become aware of until Feb. 20th, and was supposed to shown again March 6th. It wasn't. However, supposedly it will be released as a short on the Doris Day "Glass Bottom Boat" DVD scheduled for April 26, 2005. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Too bad Amazon doesn't provide some other mechanism for me to note this to others than as a review. 
 This is a great follow up to the other two books. It goes into great detail about genetics inparticular. It also covers just about everything else very nicely. As a pumpkin grower myself this book helped me grow a 370.6 pound pumpkin my first year! You could grow one too with the expert advice of this book 
 As an avid disciple of strategy and leadership, I find this book a valuable companion to Porter and Sun Tzu.  Unlike many CI books which dwells heavily on the "tricks of the trade" and  "checklists", Liam Fahey's work provides the reader a set of  conceptual frameworks for appraoching the whole CI process.  This leads to  a better understanding of the competitive environment, its dynamics and  opportunities to win.   Mr Fahey's thoughts would make a great MBA course.   But until then, this book gives the reader a first-mover advantage over  those who are still in the dark ages of strategy and competitiveness 
 This is a well-researched, comprehensive analysis of the history of heraldry in both England and Europe. It features several full-color as well as grayscale plates illustrating ancient coats of arms and the evolution of  this art to the modern day.  A glossary with illustrations is included in  the appendix, and it is well-indexed 
 _The Real American Dilemma_ is a collection of speeches and articles compiled by the editor of _American Renaissance_ magazine, Jared Taylor.  This book is very controversial material (look at the negative reviews below) because the contributors buck against politically correct notions of "multiculturalism," "diversity" and "racial equality."  The contributors come from a variety of academic backgrounds, mostly in the hard sciences.  Interestingly enough, one contributor, Michael Levin, is a Jewish philosophy professor from New York who has gotten into trouble for his views on racial issues, including his incendiary book _Why Race Matters_.  Another contributor, Fr. James Thornton, is a Greek Orthodox priest under an Old Calendarist (True Orthodox Church of Greece) jurisdiction and has several books published by the Center for Traditionalist Orthodox Studies.  Several important and intentionally disregarded (if not out-rightly slandered) issues regarding race pop up in this brief anthology: the status of Western/Christian culture and civilization, different racial characteristics that separate whites, blacks and Asians, America's disturbingly rapid browning and demographic change that favors blacks and Hispanics, "white flight" from many of America's major cities into the suburbs, "thought control" amongst the ultra-left academia against dissident views on race, and the possibility of separatist ethnic groups dividing America into different racially homogenous states.  The most noteworthy feature in my opinion comes from Fr. Thornton's essay where he cites the Christian affiliation of many prominent scholars who argued against racial equality such as Arthur de Gobineau.  Thornton notes how traditional Christianity (not the modern diluted pseudo-Marxist "social gospel" Christianity) viewed society as a tiered, hierarchical setup that reflected the rule of God over Heaven.  This is an excellent book on racial relations (or the lack thereof) in spite of some of its flaws.  It is perhaps a little too Eurocentric in places because it does deny the achievements of non-white, non-Christian cultures such as medieval Islam and ancient China and India 
 I have bought numerous copies of this book simply to add to a nice baby shower gift.  It is only appropriate for parents of healthy babies.  It is especially nice to give parents who already have one child because it deals with the real world of having a new baby 
 bought this bag a month ago. Carried a laptop everyday... i dont remember stuffing it with more load, already few stitches are coming out... and just hoping that this bag will last for atleast 6-8months... i liked the bag though... : 
 Adler and Doren believe that reading well is an art.  This book gives a step by step method to reading difficult books well.  I like this book because it has helped me to read 3 books that I found difficult to read (Homer's Illiad and Odyssey and Plato's Dialogues including The Republic). The authors provide a Great Book list in the Appendix.  
 Twenty-five years since its initial release, this 1981 comedy from Alan Alda, its director, writer and nominal star, still holds up pretty well. In fact, I just saw Norman Jewison's 2001 film, "Dinner with Friends", which feels like a partial remake in following the friendships that evolve among married couples hovering around middle age. Using Vivaldi's familiar string concertos as a transitional device, Alda's film concerns itself with three upscale couples who take vacations together every season, consequently we get four vignettes over the course of a year. It's a contrived plot machination with no sense of climax, but it all seems to fit the contours of the story.  Jack is a lawyer who would like nothing more than have group therapy sessions with his friends, while his wife Kate, a magazine editor, is a no-nonsense woman who sometimes gets frustrated with Jack's constant emotional insulation. Danny is a neurotic, penny-pinching dentist married to Claudia, an artist with the hot temper of her Italian roots. Nick is a philandering insurance agent who wants to divorce his wife Anne, a housewife frozen by her self-doubts. It is the dissolution of this last marriage that provides the impetus for the group to examine the state of their relationships with their spouses and friends. The group starts out with a spring fishing trip when Nick confides to Jack about his need for a divorce, followed by a Caribbean summer boat trip when Nick brings his new nubile girlfriend Ginny, a wide-eyed stewardess. The fall has them visiting their kids in college, and a soccer match proves to be a test of wills among the men to prove their virility to Ginny much to the chagrin of the wives. The last piece takes them to a wintry cabin where true feelings are divulged, especially as Ginny exposes the women for their vindictive exclusionary tactics.  The acting is solid. Alda seems to be doing a send-up of his own sensitive male persona as Jack, and a wisely cast Carol Burnett is actually pretty subtle as Kate. These two were such huge TV icons in the 1970's that the impact of their goodwill is almost instant. As the most comic pair, Rita Moreno and Jack Weston provide most of the laughs as they banter and bicker like Fred and Ethel Mertz redux. Broadway actor Len Cariou manages the insolence and liberation of a husband set free, while Sandy Dennis brings a palpable dimension of sadness to the socially ejected Anne. Bess Armstrong plays Ginny with an apt sunniness masking a burning need for acceptance. The story leads to little beyond a funny sight gag and an implication that Ginny will become more integral to the group, but the dialogue is often shrewdly observant and sometimes cannily witty. Alda doesn't quite have Woody Allen's sharp acumen in producing genuine laughs out of the human condition, but the film generates a good time while it lasts. The 2005 DVD has no extras 
 one of my three favorite byrds albums (the other two being "mr tambourine man" and "the notorious byrd brothers"), this is like a crossroads for all the byrds leanings in sound. the 12-string guitar is still present, the heavy psychedelia is in full bloom, and there are touches of country shadings. all in all, though, this is their most hippy oriented outting (the notorious byrd brothers album does give it a run for its money), with all the psychedelic trappings present, including reversed tapes and all that jazz. the songs are top notch, and the whole recording has a fresh playful quality that time has not diminished. this album is a must for all fans of 60's music, and highly recommended to all lovers of pop/folk/rock in general. the remasterd version is highly preferrable in sound to the first cd version, so buyer beware. the six bonus cuts could well have been left off. they add nothing to impact of the original 11 cuts 
 Tiny little book, broken up into birth to 3 months, 3-6 mo, 6-9 mo &  9-12 mo (95 pages) Quick and easy ideas for having fun with your little one.. this would make a nice gift for a baby sitter too! Sweet little book 
 I loved volume 1 of Lou's book and now I love volume 2! Keep up the good work Lou! When is book 3 coming?? 
 Lu Xun (1881-1936) was not the greatest writer produced by a certain time, or city, or nation. He was one of the greatest authors this world has ever produced. Period.   This book begins with an overview of the man's life and works. I read its long preface, something I rarely do with a career retrospective, and enjoyed it. Lu Xun lived his life. He was not lived by it.   The meat of the book comes from his short stories, prose poems and reminiscences. The only way to tell his fiction from his non-fiction is by the name of the narrator, and even then you don't really know. Lu Xun is that good.   I was immediately stunned by his turn of phrase, his utterly realistic portrayal of life, his unflinching honesty, his gentle wit. His mind, his heart, his soul. Here in his hometown, 100 years too late. I am so grateful that he wrote, because otherwise I would have never known him.   "As to why I wrote [stories], I still felt...that I should write in the hope of enlightening my people, for humanity, and of the need to better it.... My aim was to expose the disease and draw attention to it so that it might be cured."   Just a few of his early words. I also admire how he openly states that he set out to use his words as "daggers" and "javelins." Here are more of his words.   "I did my best to avoid all wordiness. If I felt I had made my meaning sufficiently clear, I was glad to dispense with frills. The old Chinese theatre has no scenery, and the New Year pictures sold to children show a few main pictures only.... Convinced that such methods suit my purpose, I did not indulge in irrelevant details and kept the dialogue down to a minimum."   Let me pause here. Lu Xun knows how to show rather than tell. But dialogue that does neither doesn't exist in his writing. That's what he means by "a minimum." His dialogue rings so true that I'm sick with jealousy, and there's an ample supply.   "I forget who it was that said that the best way to convey a man's character with a minimum of strokes is to draw his eyes. This is absolutely correct. If you draw all the hairs of his head, no matter how accurately, it will not be of much use."   The best authors have always known this. But look at how well Lu Xun explains it. I could copy and paste what he wrote about writing, pass myself off as an expert, and get rich. Let me return to his words.   "After finishing something, I always read it through twice, and where a passage grated on my ears I would add or cut a few words to make it read smoothly. When I could not find suitable vernacular expressions I used classical ones, hoping some readers would understand. And I seldom used phrases out of my own head which I alone -- or not even I -- could comprehend."   I graduated high school, in Tampa, Florida, in 1981. I was taught that simple language is bad, which we now seem to accept isn't true. In China, roughly 70 years before that, Lu Xun defended the use of words that readers actually understand. Modern China and modern USA could both learn from him on this. The goal of communication is to communicate. It really bugs me that I feel a definite need to state this.   "Truth is the life of satire. Unless you write the truth it cannot be 'satire.'" But satire must be good-intentioned. Lu Xun opposed the cynicism which "simply convinces its readers that there is nothing good in the world, nothing worth doing."   I learned all this, and was convinced I'd love his writing, before I even read the first word. Look at the intelligence, the perceptiveness, the passion, the clarity. All this from the preface alone. Before I move on to a preface written by the master himself, let me throw in some historical perspective.   The Revolution of 1911 overthrew the Qing Dynasty, but it didn't erase the imperialism and feudalism. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Lu Xun saw this. He shows us life as it was then. But please don't think of him as a "political author," the way the preface by a loyal Communist Party member encourages you to do. To reduce Lu Xun to those two words would be a terrible injustice.   Lu Xun left Shaoxing when he was 17, to study medicine. His father's death was due to medical incompetence. Lu Xun studied medicine at the Kiangnan Naval Academy in Nanjing, then at a medical college in the Japanese countryside. This background exposed him to the world, whereas most Chinese at that time knew only their little corner of China. But let me use his words again.   "...one day I saw a news-reel slide of a number of Chinese, one of them bound and the rest standing around him. They were all sturdy fellows but appeared completely apathetic. According to the commentary, the one with his hands bound was a spy working for the Russians who was to be beheaded by the Japanese military as a warning to others, while the Chinese beside him had come to enjoy the spectacle.   "Before the term was over I had left for Tokyo, because this slide convinced me that medical science was not so important after all. The people of a weak and backward country, however strong and healthy they might be, could only serve to be made examples of or as witnesses of such futile spectacles; and it was not necessarily deplorable if many of them died of illness. The most important thing, therefore, was to change their spirit..."   That's from the preface of the man's first book. Lu Xun, brand new author, states that it's okay if Chinese people die because they are sheep, and that's why he left medicine. He challenges his readers with this before they've ever read his first story. Then he presumably expects those readers to read his stories anyway.   Based on the Western stereotype of China, this is what makes authors vanish without a trace. According to some people, this is what makes authors in Bush's America vanish without a trace. But what matters is that Lu Xun never lied to a reader. That's what he felt, so that's what he wrote.   Have you read a short story collection where you raced to see how fast you could knock it out? Here a story, there a story, everywhere a story story, and two hours later you're done. An hour later, you're hungry again. That's what's hurt the popularity of the short story. Writing them is easy!   No, it's not. Not if you do it right. The well crafted short story is harder to write than a novel. Every time I read a Lu Xun short story, it ended far too soon and I had to pause while my mind caught up with what it had just witnessed. He is truly a master, and I can't recommend him highly enough.   Back to the preface before Lu Xun's preface. "Lu Xun's essays form the bulk and the most important part of his literary work." In addition to his teaching and his editing. Amazing. I've spent the past two weeks being blown away by his short stories, but the other THREE books are supposedly all more important. Given the mind of their author, I believe it. Oh, the treasures ahead.   The cynic in me would like to know about the essays that didn't make it into this collection, but never mind. Lu Xun opposed that sort of cynicism. I'm happy to spend a whole lotta time with Lu Xun, and I can.   Can you? I don't know. Check your local libraries, bookstores, websites if you must. Lately, I've read email from several Westerners who are familiar with Lu Xun. There must be a reason.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  LU XUN - SELECTED WORKS - VOLUMES TWO THRU FOUR   I'm pleased to report that Amazon.com sells a short story collection containing all 25 of Lu Xun's short stories, not just the 18 reviewed above. What this means is, you can get it at your local bookstore or perhaps even your local library. Go for it! I have it, I've read it, I love it.   Now then. I also mentioned in my previous review that the anthology claims his essays are his greatest contribution. So how do they measure up?   They measure up just fine, thank you very much. He is a master of satire and he does use words as weapons. He can make you laugh and think at the same time. A remarkable clarity of thought combined with an enviable gift for communication. Again, one need not be from China, or from the early 20th century, to appreciate this remarkable person.   When I reviewed his fiction, I used the phrase "gentle wit" even though it wasn't always gentle. Regarding his essays, I'll say biting wit. Acid wit. Devastating wit. Think Jonathan Swift, think Bertrand Russell, strip them of the rubbish and make them far more prolific. Lu Xun's even better than that, but at least you'll be on the right track.   (I almost mentioned Oscar Wilde, but he wasn't quite disciplined enough to join Lu Xun's tier. Damn witty, though.)   I don't know that you can find these essays. If you can, get them. If not, well, the short stories probably are more "timeless." I probably enjoyed the essays more on my first reading than I did the stories. But I've since read the stories numerous times, and own a collection. It's hard to say whether or not the essays would hold up to the test of repetition so well, no matter how witty their author. Essays are like that, I think.   Finally, since I've been to Lu Xun's ancestral home, and since I have some of his short stories (English translation) on my website, and I've given him his own page at Lu Xun, you can probably guess that I want to give this author my highest praise.  I'm trying.  Get the book! 
 I was born in 1984; I didn't even know who Oliver North was before I read this book.  But Dave Barry is so funny it's worth doing not-required-for-school research on public figures of the 80's simply for the payoff of getting his jokes about them.  And, of course, there are plenty of timeless inter-generational jokes about etch-a-sketches and boogers, too.  One reviewer said that this isn't really a "greatest hits" because it isn't excerpts from his other books.  That's because it's the "greatest hits" of his humorous newspaper column he wrote for the Miami Herald 
 Dr. Sanders' Saints in Exile is brilliant as a descriptive work and reminds me a great deal of The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement, which describes the movement I'm a part of. She does the difficult job of commenting critically and productively from within the movement itself.  But the book is more than just a descriptive work -- the chapters "Black Intellectuals and Storefront Religion" and "The Church in Exile," as well as the conclusion, have many thoughts toward a constructive ecclesiology for reconciling churches in the United States. Those chapters rely on many insights from the previous chapters, making the whole book a must-read for all theologians concerned with race in the American church, not simply those interested in cultural features of the Holiness churches 
 I read this as a library book and had to buy a copy for future reference. It's holistic, optimistic and energising. It draws our attention to parts of reality that our western culture tends to ignore. I hope it will bring this new (yet ancient and traditional) way of thinking into the mainstream, especially among business leaders etc 
 This book was in excellent condition considering that it is used. I was very impressed with the rate of delivery 
 IT MUST'VE BEEN SOMETHING I ATE was my introduction to Jeffrey Steingarten; I found it to be a zesty tome of tasty morsels.  Steingarten's essays (collected from VOGUE magazine) recount his forays into the world of haute cuisine. Despite moving in the upper echelon of the culinary world, Steingarten comes across as a giddy uber-gourmand-geek, travelling the world, the country, and every street in New York City, in search of the best (as he defines it) of everything when it comes to food.   From his trek across the Big Apple with his high-tech spot-thermometer to measure pizza-oven temperatures, to his southern tour of Lousiana in search of the origins of "turducken", Steingarten writes in a sly "don't you wish you were here" style. He often pokes fun at his near-maniacal enterprises to prepare (seemingly) things like a cup of espresso or a loaf of bread, but he never (well, hardly ever) pokes fun at the food -- at least not the idea of food. Good food. Really, REALLY good food.  Like a grand multiple course meal, Steingarten is best taken in small amounts -- an essay here, another there -- so that one doesn't get too full too quickly nor become overwhelmed at the sheer richness and complexity of each individual dish. Indeed, taken in moderate proportions, IT MUST'VE BEEN SOMETHING I ATE leaves one well-sated and wanting more 
 This is the first `true crime,' that I've read in about four years. The research was impeccable .... the writing excellent [although there was a tendency  to use too many articles]. Most books are slanted by the author to grind their hidden agendas into your psyche. This book is a pleasant exception. Although a bit too long, you are properly introduced to the main characters of the cult. Only problem? The graphic descriptions of Lundgren's possible rectum-retentive sexuality triggered my vomit reflex machine. It's a great read ... I couldn't put it down and finished reading the book in two days with sore eyes 
 This is a collection of four of Heinlein's epic 'future history' work.  The first selection "If This Goes On -" concerns Hugh, a young American soldier serving as a palace guard to the Prophet.  America has become a totalitarian theocracy that Hugh discovers to be corrupt.  This story is very good on it's own merit but is particularly chilling in our 21st century America confronted with totalitarian theocratic enemies and our own politically active religious right.  "Coventry" focuses on the ideas of freedom and societal responsibilities.  Years after the events of "If This Goes On -" have passed society has established total freedom for all.  The only restrictions are that one citizen is not allowed to harm another and even then there is no punishment only treatment and re-education.  Still there are those who find even these restrictions too confining and for them there is Coventry.  One such individual comes to realize that some rules exist for a reason.  "Misfit" - introduces Andrew Jackson Libby, a young member of the CCC (Cosmic Construction Corps) assigned to work in the asteroid belt while learning skills that will help him become a productive citizen.  It seems that Andy, like the rest of the CCC are considered to be bad boys, troubled youth, or juvenile delinquents.  It quickly becomes apparent that Andy does not conform to society for some other very interesting reasons.  This character will return in many of RAH's later future history works.  "Methuselah's Children" marks the debut of Lazarus Long, perhaps RAH's best know character.  Lazarus is the result of a genetic experiment on human longevity.  The resulting test subjects of this experiment now number 100,000, have life expectencies two to three times that of the rest of the population.  For years they have hidden their existence from the rest of humanity but now many of their group have decided that it is safe to let their presence be known.  They felt that the rest of humanity is ready to accept them....they were wrong.  Lazarus Long and the Howard family figure largely in the rest of Heinlein work, and is the cental figure of the last few of RAH's novels.  "Methuselah's Children" lays the ground work for these stories and is an exciting story in its own right.  This collection is a treasure trove for those unfamiliar with RAH's work and would be an excellent starting point.  If it contains any that a fan has somehow missed to this point it is a must read.   
 Victoria Pitts's book "In the Flesh" is the most brilliant analysis of postmodern culture I have ever read. Through the lens of recent phenomena in body modification--from the beautifying to the erotic and grotesque--she shows how issues of subjectivity are complexly intertwined with body strategies--performances in which the actors at once gain and lose themselves. With exquisite analysis of fascinating subjects and clear-minded use of postmodern theory, her book is the epitome of rigorous scholarship, both theoretical and empirical. It is, in a word, a theory of flesh and its agencies; but beyond the body, it offers us a scaffolding from which to view the painfully complex issues of contemporary culture at large 
 This is a heartfelt and highly interesting read that details the creation of America's transcontinental railroads from the men who spawned them down to those who built and later rode them to a new life.  The problem is that Dorris Alexander "Dee" [who can blame him for assuming that nickname] Brown was a bitter man, in no small part because of his youthful acquaintance with American Indians that led him to write I Buried My Heart at Wounded Knee.  He found little good about the railroad industry and even blamed them for the passing of the wild and wooly western frontier.  True, but so what?  That the railroads came into existence with inadequate governmental control cannot be denied, but his negativity is annoying.  I am still in the process of researching this aspect of American history and possibly could come to buy into all his arguments, but I am suspicious that Brown did not examine all the facts.  Nothing of this nature could be 100% bad.  For certain, transportation advances are a vital reason why the United States became the richest country the world has ever known.  Even Brown had to admit that railroad-spawned immigration turned the American heartland into a bread basket for the entire world.  Seems to me that alone was worth the price of admission.  The book is well worth reading, but keep an open mind 
 This movie is an edge of your seat movie that keeps you watching from start to finish.  This is about a man who says he is going on field trips for work, but instead is going to the house of his other wife, which wife #1 does not know about.  I could not stop watching this.  I tried predicting what was going to happen next, but I was wrong, and I loved that I was wrong.  Too many movies are too predictable and this one is not at all. This is easily the best movie I have ever seen. Rent it or buy it today. It is more than worth it. The ending is shocking.  I could of never guessed what was going to happen, and this movie is full of surprises. I love it. Wicked Ways is an A+ movie!  I was extremely impressed the first time I watched it.  This movie deserves five stars.  Any movie that can hook me into it so good that I do not want to leave my seat, deserves the honor of me writing this review to tell everyone else out there, that this is not just anyone predictable thriller, it is one of the best movies out there! I haven't told you much about the plot and the shocking surprises, and that is because I want you to see it for yourself. Go see it!! Trust me, there are a very few amount of movies I actually like, and I more than liked this one, I loved Wicked Ways 
 Gave nice clear instructions. Good graphics and explenations. I used it with my kids, and even they understood it 
 This is by far my favorite Stephen King novel. I did not hear any fanfare when it came out but purchased it is a break between the Dark Tower novels. The novel was a surprise in its unique story and depth.  Unlike a lot of Stephen King novels that deal with the darkening of human spirit, this novel delves more into hope. There are the bad men, "the low men in yellow coats (wonderful phrase!)" but there is also a concrete good in the world that the characters are trying to be and hold onto.  King weaves two different decades and makes connections that are not overly coincidental or trite. He also gives a few nods to his Dark Tower works, but they are not overt. You will not have had to read that series. They are more of a treat for his long term readers and the universe that he is trying to create throughout his novels.  I highly recommend this book (but don't be fooled by the movie, it is weak in comparison) 
 I was really surprised by how much I loved Geneon's "requiem from the Darkness." The short 13 episode anime series really is a breath of fresh air in a genre crwoded with Hulking mecha, predictable harem shows and over-the-top comedy. The series is visually a huge treat. The characters still are anime style but they have a slightly angular/ almost punk comic style to them. The backgrounds are very stylized and feature a amazing combination of art styles and CG work.   The story itself is a simple tale of young Momosuke attempting to collect local ghost stories for his book "100 stories." Along his way he encounters 3 strangers whose job it is to punish wrong-doers with a fate best befitting their crime. Rather than collect ghost stories Momosuke gets caught up in them and bears witness to some of the darker aspects of life in Edo-Era Japan.  The show is violent and features some scary sequences and mature themes but isnt gratuitous in its depictions. Overall the mood is suspenseful with bits of comedy and drama here and there. I recommend the regular verion of this series as oppossed to the boxset. The Boxset has cheap plastic holders (think CD flip book holders) for all 4 DVDs but not the cover art. The boxset is pointless unless you are okay with keeping JUST the DVDs from volumes 2-4 and throwing away the cases and cover art. AT half the price plus with a case to match vols 2-4, the regular version is the way to go.   If you are looking for some beautiful and offbeat anime with a plot this is an EXCELLENT place to start. Don't let this quiet release slip by  
 There's something for everyone here: from what to do with beautiful antique hankerchiefs to decorative items to baby gifts, etc. The instructions are clear and concise, and the author leaves no stone--or flea market find--unturned. Harding really knows her stuff 
 This will Teache you how to go into a Sales call,  With a plan, outline and a goal,   Very good worth buying,  giving to your sales managers 
 Bo Derek was only 16 when she starred in this beautifully photographed "coming-of-age" film.  As with most of her films, the backstory is more fascinating than the actual movie: A pretty young model (named Cathy Collins) is whisked away to the panoramic Greek island of Mykonos to star in a romantic idependent film.  She falls in love with director John Derek, a handsome, married, former matinee idol who is 30 years older than her. He eventually marries her and transforms her into the first screen sex goddess of the 1980's. This film showcases Bo's young beauty as Anastasia, the rebellious Greek orphan who lives most of her life like the literary character Walter Mitty, in a complete fantasy world (hence the title). She sails around with her older "brother" Damir, played by Peter Hooten, looking for the opportunity to open a resort on the small island where they live. As they discover that they're not really brother and sister, a strange, uneasy love begins to blossom. This is a lovely, sincere film with an odd element of reality slipping in some scenes (note the older photographer who visits the island and creates a 70's fashion photo montage with Bo! The photographer even tells her,"One day, the whole world will want to take your picture!" He got that right!) There is some incidental nudity, but nothing too extensive like in her later films. This is one of those innocent, sappy movies that helps everyone to fantasize that sometimes, love really does conquer all.. 
 Most people doesn't realize that this band SUCK'S!!!! I AM a "HARD-CORE ROCKER FAN" but please!! Is not because this band doesn't know how to play music or is fictional, is beacause it suck's!!   The reason that Spinal Tap suck's is because of their bloopers in live-concert and most of all THEIR STUPID LYRICS!!!!!  I mean: "YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED, OR MAYBE YOU DON'T!!!!!??????" "LISEN, SHHHHH!! WHAT THE FLOWER PEOPLE SAY AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!?????" "THE CATS MEOW!!!???" "SEX FARM WOMAN!!!???" "BIG BUTTON!!!!??" "I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME EARDRUMS BLEED!!!!????"  COME ON! PEOPLE!!!! Try to realize why this movie is sooo funny! BEACUSE ALL THE PEOPLE LIKE A BAND THAT IS PURE GARBAGE!!!!!! But don't get me wrong! I did enjoy this movie(documentary really) because is a parody of the rock bands in the 60's, 70's and early 80's. And their music is LOUD, FAST and HEAVY!!!  Adios.             
 Principles and Practice is designed as a  text that would accompany a  college-level  program in the fundamentals of herbal  medicine as practiced  in the modern  British tradition. The authors are senior  educators in that  system, Mills in Britain  and Bone in Australia. This textbook easily meets  the  scientific standards of a contemporary medical  school. Yet it does  not slight traditions,  and the materia medica sections contain, in   addition to an unusually complete  scientific review, details of the  plants'  traditional uses. The therapeutics sections  reflect traditional  approaches rather than  single-bullet modern "scientific"  herbalism.  The authors collective experience -- more than forty years  between the two -- provides  balance in the interpretation of the science   and the relative importance of hypothetical  aspects of toxicology and  potential adverse  effects 
 this one is good very good in fact! imagine vampires came forward and revealed themselves to the world (only about 4500 world wide) sun does not harm them they are allergic to silver (umm werewolves eh sheesh) and beheading is fatal its a modern future that looks decayed such as ww3 took place (in london no less lol) but the explanation of vampires as an evolutionary step rather then supernatural was refreshing for a change yes they can climb walls yes they drink blood and yes they are super strong ( as demonstrated in the video of vampires showing themselves lifting something not so light hehe) 4 of 5 stars only one star loss for being a little talkie but theres enough action and vampire action to make this film a must own to any true vampire fan 
 Once I read "Hero in the Shadows" I had to go back and read the other "Waylander" tales. A strong plot and even stronger characters in a genre I love. No body crosses "Waylander" twice. A true anti-hero in the "man with no name" family    
 There aren't too many good books on the fabrication and repair of structures that use high modulus fibers like Carbon and Kevlar, modern core materials, and high performance resins.  While this British title "goes on a bit" and is not for the illiterate, it does an excellent job of walking you through the process of building and repairing parts that would not be out of place on any track in the country.  It will also be useful to airplane and boat builders 
 If you love the Sun Signs you'll also love this book! Gives you insight about your compatibility and advice with other sun signs. Praise again to Linda Goodman for being hilarious, quirky and entertaining! Don't miss this one!! 
 AWESOME PROGRAM - AWESOME BOOK.  IT IS VERY HELPFUL.  WE HAVE LOANED THIS BOOK OUT MANY TIMES 
 If you're only going to buy one of the volumes of the Complete Sherlock Holmes, then this is the one I would recommend.  The later stories are very good, too, but the ones in this one are better 
 Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did.  It was a pleasant surprise to discover how well it was filmed; there are some very nice shots, with satisfying emotional twists.  Great job by the actors (with the exception of the Italian Mob boss, who I found quite comical).  I can truthfully say that I watched every minute and was sorry to see it end.  Best $4.35 I ever spent on a movie! :-)  Give it a try... 
 I read this book for the first time in the early eighties on a flight to Dallas via San Antonio, San Marcos and Austin (cheapest ticket).  It was not my first contact with Eastern Philosophy.  I attended several TM classes as a senior in high school and had always been very interested in Tibet and Buddhism.    This book can alter your life.  It is deceptively simple.  How to live an honorable life without the violence that we are so accustomed to.  I have read it numerous times and given away all of my copies.  During the years I have had several books on my shelf that Chogyam wrote and never read them.  It seemed to be enough just to have them there sitting on the shelf radiating his wisdom out to the world from my bookshelf.  Silly, I know but my heart was opened, moved and changed by the wisdom contained in just this one book.  Working in a giant communications company and living in the southwest tail of the bible belt offered many, many opportunities to test and apply what I had absorbed from this book.  Combined with a weekly fix of New Dimensions I set about trying to live my life from the wisdom contained.   It was and still is a wonderful experience.  For those who have a difficult time in separating the message from the messinger you might try reading "The Essential Crazy Wisdom" by Wes Nisker.   Chogyam was a great gift to America - wisdom that is desperately needed in today's times.  
 It's a real shame when an artist gets unfairly lumped in with a 'movement' or a 'scene', because there's a good chance that their commercial shelf life is going to be cut short the minute that journalists run out of nice things to say about their particular fad. In the case of Juliana Hatfield, the press came up with some silly notion that women hadn't made rock music until the early 1990's and exploited every woman with a distortion pedal who mentioned their libido in any form at all. Back in 1993, she was in every magazine's sidebar when they wrote their inevitable "1993 - Year Of The Woman" article, next to PJ Harvey, Bjork and Liz Phair. And sure, those are all decent artists in their own right, (or at least they were at the time... right Liz?), but besides their recording contracts and genitalia, they couldn't have been further removed from each other. When the mainstream press did give her a proper article they were preoccupied with Juliana's unusually high voice, her virginity and her relationship with Evan Dando... everything but the fact that she was one of the best musicians and songwriters to eek out of the nineties alternative rock boom.   From her early days in the Blake Babies until her recent sojurn with the Some Girls side project, Juliana has concurrently exceeded and confounded the expectations of her loyal fan base. When we expected another jangly pop hit like 1993's megasuccessful "My Sister", we got the dark heaviness of the Only Everything album. On the same day in 2000 we got the gorgeous, laid-back and mostly acoustic Beautiful Creature... as well as the mangled and deafening Total System Failure record. When Atlantic refused to release her 1997 album God's Foot for no discernible reason, Juliana went on an unsuccessful hunger strike. When the critics hailed her as the Next Big Thing, she refused to 'smile for the camera', because she felt she hadn't 'earned it'. She's unpredictable for sure, but she can also bust out with some of the most innovative guitarwork since J Mascis.  Most critics (and some stubborn fans) don't want to look past her major label heyday, but it'd behoove any fan of well crafted pop/rock to do so. If you want some slicker-than-turtlewax pop sheen, you gotta check out In Exile Deo. Want some loud, first-take rock with seriously bipolar lyrics? Man, come over and I'll play you Bed from 1998 and follw it up with last year's insidious Made In China. You won't leave my house the same, I assure you.   If it exists in the rock spectrum, you can bet that Juliana Hatfield has tried it and likely improved upon the formula. So why is she so consistently overlooked? As far as I can tell, the cardinal sin of commercial success is following your heart and writing to please yourself, in which case Juliana will continue to be passed over for artists that will show cleavage and flirt with reporters. You'd think that sticking to your guns, being yourself and having an impeccable resume of records under your belt would be enough to set the world on fire. Nope, the world at large will have to settle for hearing "My Sister" and and the jangly hit "Spin The Bottle" on every 'old school weekend' that Modern Rock stations like to do when they are out of ideas. The rest of us will just have to settle for Juliana Hatfield being our little secret.   Damn 
 This is simply a magic recording!  This is Louis Armstrong at his best!  The fact that the material is that of W.C. Handy makes this recording all the better and a treasure for the music lover!  Flawless 
 So you want to change something in the way people are working? Where to begin? Why is nobody paying attention? Or you thought the change was going great but then everything fell apart? This book takes concepts like leadership, urgency, vision, strategy, and communication and puts them in an easy-to-understand order.  Changing an organization or even your own team may not be easy, but at least if you read this book, the challenges won't be surprises as well 
 This was a wonderful story that my husband and children just loved. We learned about some new vegetables in the process.  As a kid I wasn't fond of bitter melon, but I'm willing to give it a second try after reading the book! My 5 and 6 year old boys are clamoring for us to go out, buy some ugly vegetables, and make the soup!  This book appeals to every member of the family and the illustrations are beautiful 
 Dickey Betts is the perfect choice for the first ever live DVD release recorded at The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, churning out classic Allman Brothers tunes like "Blue Sky" and "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed," along with newer material. Betts and Danny  Toler click like a well oiled machine on the dual leads of "Jessica,"  and Betts brings his son Duane into the party for a few songs. The father son resemblance is quite amazing. Great interview footage is an added bonus, as is the CD of live material that comes with this stunning package 
 Jill Sobule of course!!!!! What else? Now she even has a new CD. I Never Learn to Swim. It has all my favorite songs on it, and a few more that I have just started to fall in love with. I have been in and out of relationships all my life and Jill has a song for all of them. Her satirical wit makes me laugh even when I am in the worst of moods. When I am in the mood to do something goofy all I have to do is walk around a public place with my girlfriend and sing songs like I Kissed a Girl and Supermodel.If I feel like curling up into a tight ball in crying all I have to do is listen to Hudini's Box. Sometimes when I just need to hear that someone else has problems I listen to The Girl in the Affair or Lucy at the Gym. You all should buy I Never Learned to Swim along with Pink Pearl, Jill Sobule, and Happy Town. All have great songs on them for all occasions. I hope you all can learn to appriciate all that Jill Sobule is. I love her so much for so many reasons and because I never learned to swim eithe 
 Understand spiritualism and see the larger picture of life and existence through this autobiography, which breaks down barriers between religions 
 Books on writing (novels, poetry, fiction, nonfiction, plays, memoirs) are a dime a dozen, and should be offered for sale for precisely that amount.  "To Be A Playwright" is a book that captures and makes specific what has been, until now, seemingly without explication; ephemeral.  It is, apart from being an engaging memoir by a successful, award winning playwright, very grounded in the ways-to convert the dream into producible,saleable marks on the page.  Forget the title and buy it for reasons and ways to write 
 My Daughter loves to draw and she loves this book!!! She is 8 and this was perfect would recommend again!! 
 Daring to Dream is the first story in the Dream Trilogy.  It focuses on Margo Sullivan, the daughter of the Templeton's housekeeper.  Margo's best friends are her two "sisters" whose stories are told in the other books.  Margo is beautiful and has always had plans to see the world and be famous.  Margo gets her wish, becoming a famous model in Europe, but a scandal involving her agent takes it all away.  With nothing left, she returns home to Templeton House.  Josh Templeton, the heir of the fortune, has had a crush on Margo since they were kids.  He jokingly gives her the idea of opening a store, which of course, she takes seriously.  With the help of her sisters, she finds a building near Fisherman's Wharf and opens Pretenses, a store that customers can purchase high-end second hand items.  Margo sells a lot of her own things that are no longer needed to get things going.    Josh and Margo go the usual route in a romance relationship, but I enjoyed reading it tremendously.  Josh is not the spoiled heir, he's a lawyer for the Templeton Hotel chain, and actually goes to work.  He sees a new side of Margo when she starts her store, which draws him to her even more.  Intertwined in this story is the one of Seraphina, a young girl who killed herself when the love of her life died.  She left behind a treasure buried somewhere in the cliffs by Templeton House, and the girls hope to someday find it.  This is also a great story of the love and friendship between Margo, Kate and Laura.  They have completely different personalities, but together, they make a great team.  They are there for each other no matter what, no questions asked.  We should all be that lucky in our lives.  This was a great start to the series.  I recommend it to anyone.  If you've read Nora Roberts before, you know you won't be disappointed.  If you've never read one of her books, this is a great one to start with 
 The previous reviews of the Enterprise series are accurate and fair.  The writing was at times weak, but the show's concepts were so brilliant and the acting so well done that it overcame the weak scripts and turned the strong scripts into some of the best Star Trek television episodes in history.  The two episodes focusing on the Vulcan civil war rank as among the strongest in the series, not only telling an important part of the Star Trek canon, but doing so with especially good acting.  It explained well the variance of the Vulcan characters' duplicity with the straight honesty of the Vulcans of Spocks' era.  Indeed, Spock represented the Vulcans who ultimately won the civil war and abolished the corrupt Vulcan High Command.  Not often mentioned directly, but poignant for me, were the two episodes focusing on the Terra Prime terror group.  For me, the interaction of the clone infant and the T'Pol character was some of the most well acted portions of the series.  It wasn't the typical mother/infant interaction, but it bridged a gap between the cultural differences of Vulcans while also providing a glimpse of the underlying similarities of the human and Vulcan races.  The final scene of Trip and T'Pol standing by their dying daughter was a particularly poignant moment that needed a strong expansion in the series finale.  Speaking of the finale, the dessert was particularly unappealing.  The series finale was so horrible and mangled that it will endure as a low point in the entire history of the Star Trek industry.  The Enterprise ensemble cast did their best to polish a shoddy script, but could only do so much.  The series deserved to end with a series entirely devoted to the cast.  A story set at the time of the Enterprise NX-01 decommissioning was perfect.  It should have been a series of ensemble cast memories played out in a script of the sadness of seeing "the old girl" put out to pasture.  The Archer speech at the founding of the Federation of Planets should have been given a full weight of the speech laid before us.  T'Pol and Trip should have had a bittersweet ending of their crew association, with a final answer on whether or not they were going to endure as a Vulcan/Human couple.  Trip's death was a distraction, not central to the theme, and horrible disjointed.  It is a bitter fruit for all Star Trek fans who liked this series -- and there were many who did.  The series finale almost seemed to be the two original producers getting together and serving up a poison pill for Paramount to consume.  It was anything but a valentine.  It's true indication of bitterness is the fact that not a single primary actor in the series has supported the script, and all who have commented have provided bitter recriminations.  Blaylock, Bacula, and Trinneer have all offered blunt honest negative assessments.  These views are accurate.  People who will likely purchase this DVD collection are fans of the series, and don't need a review to make a purchasing decision.  However for those few who did not see the series I highly encourage you to purchase the collection.  All four seasons contain nuggets of beautiful scripts and excellent acting.  It should be enjoyed in sum as a series that boldly went in a direction where many mistakes were made by the characters in trying to form the rules for future crews.  
 This CD is certainly a good one. It starts off very fantastic for a good portion of the cd, and then i feel as though it fizzles out. I highly recomend this cd if you are thinking about ording it. it is definetly worth the mone 
 In an earlier review I had stated that T.D.'s "Melrose" was their most haunting since this one. Well "Hyperborea" is their absolute most haunting an surreal c.d. ever in my book. It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there. I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'. And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape. If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you. And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out). You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider "Hyperborea" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.   Does that sound like someone on an acid trip? Just buy it and you'll understand. And you should also enjoy it immensely. 
 I'm currently a Viper pilot and I think this book was awesome. Sure there are some inaccuracies, but Mr. Aleshire did a good job overall capturing the feelings and the attitude of a young fighter pilot.  Capt Quattlebaum: just because you don't know there is a rift in your class doesn't mean it isn't there. My class had a contentious assignment process and guess what - hard feelings were there until the day we graduated.  Yes, being an F-16 pilot is about hard work and dedication, but it's a damn good time, too. 
 Very, very funny, the first few chapters, that is. After that, the funniness beings to lose steam a bit 
 This book covers human and animal slavery in an incisive way.  Ms. Spiegel uncovers many interesting facts and presents them in a way many people will understand 
 This is a must have journal. It is wonderfully put together and helps you invent memories for your little ones for years to come.  My only concern is that it wasn't spiral bounded so you could add pictures and so forth.  I took mine and got it spiral bounded now I love it even more

 What a sweet, simple, appropriate story for little ones just starting to sleep through the night in underpants.  If your little one is daytime potty trained and you are looking for a way to bridge the gap at nighttime, this  book is it.  Hines captures the essence of a three year old's world  perfectly with the illustrations and straightforward text.  A wonderful  book for those who need it 
 A great resource for stay at home mothers who are struggling with losing their identity. I stayed home for 12 years and can relate to every issue Christine addresses. I encourage mothers who are home with their children and those who are considering staying home to read this book 
 This book is the perfect companion for Dr. Bernstein's "The Diabetic Diet - the Low-Carbohydrate Solution." Reading both these books over and over help me stay on track.  I can already see what following Dr. B's recommendations has done for me.  I am losing weight, I have more energy, and I have improved blood glucose readings.  I don't want to wait until I have Diabetes 2 to be healthier, because I my liver is already diseased from being insulin resistant.  By the way, the cheese cake recipe is delicious.  Who needs sugar when food can taste so good without it 
 It is a very good book.  It has presented very clearly some difficult-to-understand relationship especially the link between algebra and geometry.  It is a very good balance - history, Mathmatics, biography all mixed very well together.  Highly recommended 
 I really enjoyed Fred Haefele's Rebuilding the Indian: A Memoir.  This book is a delight. I liked it on several levels...there is real wrench-turning and parts hunting tales...there are colorful characters...there is a man undergoing a self-actualization and maturity coming to realize just what it means to be a man.  He figures out where he fits in between  his dad, his grown kids and his first and second wife and new baby all the while building a big motorcycle and running a arborist business. And it is fun while he is doing it.   I gave it to my wife (a high school English teacher) and she gave it to some of her 11th grade reluctant readers who are more at home turning wrenches than they are writing essays.  It appealed to these kids tremendously.  I don't have a motorcycle and I am not going to build one but I do love reading about it.  I found this to be a great book.  If you like this one you may also like A Cliff Walk by Don Snyder.   
 I love Christmas music and I love Sufjan Stevens.  When I saw that Sufjan had his own FIVE CD Christmas album, I bought it without hearing so much as a single track, knowing that whether the album was a success or failure, at least it would be unlike any other Christmas CD I own.  Of course Santa Sufjan did not let me down.   First of all, the packaging and the graphic design of this mini box-set of Christmas CD's is awesome--It's worth buying just for the packaging.  It includes a free set of stickers, a comic, a Stevens family Christmas portrait, and the most extensive liner notes in recording history, including some excellent Christmas essays and artwork.  I was having so much fun with all that, it was a while before I even listened to the first CD of the set!   The five CD's are a collection of non-commercial CD-R's that Sufjan would make for friends and family each Christmas.  The first four CD's were not intended to be sold or marketed, and are made up of mostly simple recordings of classic carols and many original Christmas songs.  I believe the fifth disk was the only one created with the knowledge that it would be sold.    Since these CD's were made from the heart, and were certainly not an attempt to milk the Christmas music market, one is going to hear songs done in a very simple, rugged and direct manner, with warts and all.  Phil Spector's "wall-of-sound" this is not.  Rather, it is a humble, contrite attempt at honoring Christmas and Christ with song.  Sufjan Stevens channeling the Little Drummer Boy, in a very literal sense, though there are a few songs that are more Spector than Simon & Garfunkel.   In my vast collection of Christmas CD's, numbering well over 50 disks, I found that there is one particular style that really stands out when employed, and that is when an artist chooses to focus on Christmas carols rather than the various secular holiday songs, and then does a simple, straightforward interpretation of these carols, with little to no embellishment.  One of the early examples of this is Mitch Miller's "Christmas--Sing Along with Mitch."  That album is filled with classic carols, minimal orchestration, and brilliant, lively voices.  It works because Mitch wisely leaves the carols alone, staying away from cutesy production tricks, and allows the beauty of the songs to speak for themselves.  No doubt Mitch Miller's album was in Sufjan sites when creating this box set, complete with the tongue-in-cheek "SINGALONG in Stereo" blurb on the front of the box.     Like the Mitch Miller album, Sufjan also chooses to stay mainly with carols, rather than do another rendition of "White Christmas" or "Santa Clause is Coming to Town." (However, we do get a Santa Sufjan original: "Get Behind Me Santa!")  Like Mitch, his singing of the carols is fairly straight forward, with little fluff or ornamentation--he leaves that for the packaging.  But unlike Mitch, Sufjan is quite creative with the musical accompaniment, giving carols a sound that is very earthy and simple.  There is a definite folk/blue grass interpretation which is a real pleasure to listen to; it's the polar opposite the big band/swing/jazz style of most secular Christmas albums.     Yet there is more than just carols on this CD, Sufjan gives us many of his own original Christmas songs, which are neither secular nor sacred, but somehow occupy a space in between.  They are spiritual without being King James, and they are secular without being profane.  Singing about K-Mart, Santa and Jesus in the same tune is something only Sufjan could pull off.  While there are some interesting songs in Sufjan's originals, I much prefer his folksy interpretations of the classic carols.   Then there are those carols in which we only get a simple, pleasing instrumental number, no voices or singing, just like the neat little instrumentals spread around Sufjan's 'Illnois' album.  They are a wonderful little treat, kind of the musical equivalent of an occasional snack of a Christmas cookie.  Speaking of Illinois, there are a few songs, especially from the fourth and fifth disks that would have worked well on either the Illinois or Avalanche albums despite their Christmas theme.  Sadly, while not lacking in creativity or originality, "Songs for Christmas" just doesn't quite cut it as a classic Christmas album.  It's refreshingly experimental and "ad hoc" sound will not endear many listeners, as there seems to be certain unspoken parameters as to how far you can push Christmas music interpretations.  Outside of the Sufjan faithful, I doubt many folks will be shelving their Bing Crosby or Carpenters disks in favor of "Songs for Christmas." Still, the best thing on this album are Sufjan's beautiful, light renditions of ancient carols, and the album is worth purchasing for those alone.    In a recent Christmas essay, Garrison Keillor states that all one really needs to have a wonderful Christmas are the there "C's" -- carols, cookies, and candles.  Well Sufjan Steven's Christmas box set will certainly meet and exceed the "carols" requirement.   Maybe next year he'll throw in the cookies and candles, I wouldn't put it past him. 
 BUY THE DVD if you can! BUY THE DVD if you can! I purchased Tye's DVD of Victory BEFORE I bought the cd.  I must say that the CD DOES NOT adequately capture the level of anointing that is over, under, and through this project.   Tye so reminds me of David.  I remember how in 2 Samuel 6:14-onward David danced before the Lord with all his might and his wife Michal got angry with him, though God was pleased. God made Michal barren and she never bore children.  Deep.  With that said, I initially thought that our brother Tye might've done more lyric-wise on some of the songs.  HOWEVER, after having SEEN the DVD a couple of times, I realized that NOTHING needed to be changed.    The musical and vocal arrangements are fantastic, as usual. Also, there are many entertaining and inspiring VISUAL surprises that imbue each song with a liveliness and anointing that you obviously could not see on the CD, which is why I encourage you to purchase the DVD to experience the sincere heart for God that Tye AND G.A. exude.    OVERALL, (smile) to reiterate the David concept, I am so glad that worship is all about God and never about us.  Tye can't really sing, but that's okay.  You hear his heart for God when he does, when he strains. I believe that God is pleased with Tye's latest project, and that is all that really matters ultimately.   I pray that this message will encourage you to sow into Tye and GA's ministry.  It's great, fertile ground! 
 With all the interest lately in manifesting our dreams and consciously creating our own reality, the book "Flowdreaming" comes at just the right time.    Have you ever felt like you were in the wrong place at the wrong time?  Do annoying little incidences plague you?  Then you are OUT of the flow!   Have you ever been in the right place at the right time?  Has it ever seemed that good fortune seems to guide your every step?  This is being in the flow.      Flowdreaming is actually a manifestation technique that involves relaxation and visualization.  It provides simple, yet powerful, techniques for getting into the flow of the Universe so that you can stay in that place where it feels good and positive things seem to keep happening.  Along with providing the basic techniques for "flowdreaming," the book also goes into what the "flow" actually is and the author provides a reading list for further study to those interested.    For those who have struggled with the more traditional methods of manifestation, this book provides the missing link, making manifestations more readily available to anyone willing to try.  A CD of guided visualizations is also provided, and I found this to be very beneficial.    I thoroughly enjoyed Summer McStravick's writing style, which was simple and to the point.   For anyone wishing to attract more synchronicities and positive energy into their lives, I would highly recommend "Flowdreaming."        
 I had higher expectations of what the full soundtrack would sound like.  The previews Amazon gives you is junk for listening to previewing a product.  The movie was so spectular that I thought more highly of the soundtrack.. 
 I bought this book for a class I took while I was an undergrad, and I used this book almost as much as I used the text for the class.  I was able to find almost everything I needed, and in the end, it was worth having.  I would recommend this for anyone taking law classes, however, I would buy a used copy because new copies can be a little pricy 
 Once again Mr. Updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women  - love, lust, betrayal, self doubt.  Villages relates Owen's life as only John Updike can.  The last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book, but I will certainly recommend it to all my friends 
 These are some of the most heartwarming songs. I even find myself singing the ones about poor Mr. Scrooge 
 How often does a book come along which should delight both readers and non-readers? This one does, because those who aren't fond of reading can simply watch the DVD of Wallace's finest interviews (included with this book).  After that, I'm betting they'll want to read the book, if only to get the kind of details that the DVD only hints at. Wallace not only opens up about his personal life but shares plenty of anecdotes about celebrities and life on the 60 Mintues set.     He also is quite honest about his struggle with a particularly intense depression, one that nearly sidelined him. This section alone should serve as inspiraton to readers who think that successful people are somehow impervious to pain and difficulty. I was impressed by his willingness to speak honestly about this challenging part of his life.    As someone who can (by his own admission) be blunt and perhaps too outspoken at times, Wallace also reveals some of the tiffs and rough moments he has had with some of his subjects- and when and how he made up with most of them...but not all. He had his share of enemies as well as at least one major lawsuit (a lawsuit that may have been a factor in his depression).        Wallace has interviewed an amazing number of famous people, from Richard Nixon to Nancy Reagan, from crooks to celebrities, famous athletes as well as statesmen.  
 Actually the premise of this film would earn 5 stars, but the acting was so bad I did have a difficult time in getting through it.  Watching it a second time allowed me to pay attention to the script more and it was well worth the second viewing.  The acting, unfortunately, did not got any better 
 Usually people don't complain about receiving money from an anonymous source, but Investigator Kinsey Millhone knows that she needs to report the $5000 which has mysteriously appeared in her bank account.  No one seems to know where the money has come from and soon it is all part of a problem that involves Kinsey as a suspect in an insurance fraud case.  As she delves into the investigation, she uncovers a prominent family's secrets and continues to get into trouble herself.  As usual, Kinsey's investigation causes physical danger to her, until she hunts down the perpetrator.  This is another good read from Sue Grafton 
 The human body contains about 100 trillion cells, but only 10 trillions of them are human.  The rest belong to the entities that call our body home.  In Human Wildlife Robert Buckman takes us through a tour of the lives of the worms, bacteria, viruses and other creatures that live on and in us.    I picked up this book after listening to an interview with Dr Buckman.  I was fascinated by the details Buckman provided on the origins of pheromones (produced by bacteria in our armpits), mouth breath (bacteria at the back of the tounge), and the cause of fart smell (colon bacteria breaking down proteins).  What finally sold me on the book was the discussion on feces, a topic on which I know very little.    Now that I have finished reading the book I can say that I have not been disappointed.  Buckman is informative while entertaining at the same time.  His story about the fart-in-the-library problem made me laugh out loud :)  I wish Buckman went into a little more details on some topics, but that can only be expected from an introductory text geared toward the general public.    Last but not least, the pictures and illustrations in this book are outstanding.  I will never look at an eyebrow again without expecting to see a little Demodex, an eyebrow mite that two thirds of us carry, wiggling its tail back at me. 
 This is actually the first LP album I ever bought over thirty years ago. I listened to it again after a very long time when this remastered version was released. I think some of the hype being said about this album is way overblown, although it is a very good record by one of the seventies most notable also-rans. Some of Ian Hunter's Dylanesque Dylanisms are overly Dylany, as on "Ballad of Mott" and "I Wish I Was Your Mother", but the overall strength of the songwriting outweighs his croaking out of his sometimes clumsy lyrics.    Worth owning for the immortal "All The Way From Memphis" alone, but the rest of the album is a fun ride.   
 The Greeks accorded Aries in their pantheon: a jealous, spiteful god that promotes a self-generated, ever thirsty desire for risky assault, destruction, and revenge - elevating (like the most powerful narcotic), and simultaneously abysmally sickening. Accorded power, Aries assumes complete control in a cycle of destruction, wounds, pride, and revenge.  The lesson of this work is peace and normal life become abhorrent to one (even the most artistic and promising) who tastes comba 
 This is an extremely practical book. If I were a beginner, I might be overwhelmed by or fail to appreciate the wealth of material presented here. But for the intermediate/advanced operator this is an excellent way to pick up carbine skills and better understand its strengths and limitations. To that end the text does cover the 5.56 Nato's terminal ballistics through 16" and 20" barrels at the critical ranges--absolutely essential if your life or the lives of your loved ones are on the line.  I've been impressed by both of Suarez' shotgun ("Tactical Shotgun") and carbine training "manuals". They are filled with many excellent photographs where you can see what the author is talking about. And the material is thorough, consistent and well paced, what you'd expect from a competent/skilled trainer. A must have for the complete rifleman 
 Low-David Bowie *****   Ironicaly the title of this album is Low while it is deffinatley one of the high points of David Bowie's career. released as part of the Berlin Trilogy along with Station To Station and Heros as these were recorded in Berlin right after David Bowie, Lou Reed, and Iggy Pop all kicked herion. The album sounds very Berlin as well, kind of like when U2 went there to record Achtung Baby. The sound is still very modern and fresh sounding almost thirty years after the original release of the album.   Low helped to show what a true talent Bowie is. playing almost all lead guitar, bass, arp, cellos, horns, brass strings, saxophones, harmonica, piano, and arranging everything. But he did not create this masterpiece alone he was lent all-star help from the great Brian Eno, then from Roxy Music and later Echo And The Bunnymen. Also Carlos Alomar lends help on rhythm guitar, Ricky Gardener on some guitar, George Murray on bass, Roy Young on piano, Dennis Davis on percusion, and the great Iggy Pop and Mary Visconti on backing vocals. Talk about an all-star lineup! Made after his plastic soul stint and before his techno laiden 1980's. This album really sounds as the precursor to that period in Bowie's career.  This album is truly one of a kind in the David Bowie musical cannon. Much like Space Oddity was very folk, and The Man Who Sold The World was his hard rock master piece this is progesssive and techno and rock n' roll and everything else. Low is very rich in wide and deep soundscapes, another thing that Bowie helped to create and usher in to popular music. One of the most endearing things about this album is that with all the synthasizers (which are actually good here), and prog rock sounds David makes sure to make room for the guitat on this album. This is an album very rich in guitar every song is pact full of great guitar work.  'Breaking Glass' 'What In The World' 'Sound And Vision' 'Always Crashing In The Same Car' and 'Be My Wife are all great rockers. The lyrics on this album are hard to get at first and sometimes takes quite a few listens before you truly understand what the song is about and what is actaully happening during the track. 'Subterraneans' is taking from David Bowies love for Jack Kerouack's literature and the book of the same title. The song is a great closer to say the least. The album also has a great opener as well. 'Speed Of Life' is a perfect segway into the album from Station To Station and into 'Breaking Glass.The song is an instrumental or really a grand soundscape as is much of the rest of the album. 'A New Career In A New Town' 'Art Decade' and 'Weeping Wall' are all instrumentals and I know when I first thought of Bowie doing instrumentals especially with Synths I was skeptical but it works out and really paid off for him. 'Warsawa' is a 6:20 length song sang in either French or German and it sounds strange but if it wasn't than it would not be Bowie would it? A great track and one that makes for an interesting listen every time.  The depth of Bowie can not be sumed up in one review even when that one review is based on one single album. While Low was released over twenty five years ago it still sounds amazing and is concidered to be one of the all time greatest albums ever, and it is easily one of David Bowie top five if not the best. So I will end on this note, I recomend Low to everyone 
 Ilove my movie, and the prices was GREAT   your delivery kinda sucks th 
 Though the illustrations of this book should have been sharpened digitally, they but slightly take away from this warm account of Hemingway's love for his pets.   I seldom mention this, but it was a 6-toed "Hemingway Cat" that spurred me into action one Spring day in 1997. I met Hemingway at his 1959 Pamplona Fiesta. He invited me to join his group. I was a young American freelance writer/photographer from Madrid and he generously let me photograph him. I had just returned from backpacking through the mountains of Tunisia to find a WW2 battle site called Hill 609 at a fortified mountain. Hemingway knew the outfit; he liked what I had done. Despite our difference in years, we spoke the same language.  Long after his death, many years later, a large black tomcat brought a trailing gray and white kitten into my Florida backyard and left it. My wife and I had no kids. I tried not to allow the kitten to adopt us. But that was impossible. She did anyway. I nicknamed her SuperPaws though she won our hearts as simply, Pooky. As she grew into a quietly beautiful young lady and our love for her grew deep, I wondered if Hemingway was trying to tell me something with this strikingly singular big-pawed cat. Her sudden appearance touched me. The big black tom cat that brought her to me, then disappeared from our neighborhood. It made me think of Hemingway and his cats. It made me in the back of my mind wonder if there was any connection at all. I am definitely not superstitious. Still, was there a meaning to this? I had always intended writing a Hemingway book, but never did. Now, I wondered if something -- Hem maybe -- was urging me to go ahead and do it.  Pooky's presence seemed more than happenstance. That spring of 1997 I kissed my wife, JuliaAnn, goodbye and returned to Europe to backtrack Hem through his Paris haunts, back to Pamplona before the fiesta, and then backpacked into Spain's high Pyrenees where I found such strange things as where he and his buddy had hidden bottles of wine to chill in a spring near where they trout fished, and an old piano in a hostel where he stayed, with his name, incorrectly spelled, scratched on it along with a wrong date.  After his death other books filled in unknown details for me. I put them all together, our chance meeting, his interest in me, what I saw at Pamplona, and then what others reported later. Things fitted like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. My memoir, "Hemingway's Paris and Pamplona, Then and Now" was published in 2000. In late 2003, Pooky, our beautiful long-furred gray and white neutered female cat disappeared after a full moonlit night outdoors. We believe she was visiting three new kittens that lived across the street. I was off on a trip but my wife searched fruitlessly, driving around the deep woods behind the houses across the street. No Pooky. The city said they had recovered no dead cats during that period. I figured she might have been catnapped. But losing her was as sad as losing a family member. Worse, the following spring, 2004, my wife of 48 years suddenly developed a fast-growing strain of lung cancer and died. The coincidence of these strange events still haunt me.   Hemingay's fondness for cats always had a subtle but very profound affect on his inner self. All cat lovers know and have felt this but none of us seem to understand why. Yet, there is nothing quite like a cat to make you appreciate the profound pleasure of their company.  No wonder the Ancient Egyptians had such reverence for them. Cats were working their wily ways with mankind even back then. As for the peculiar circumstances surrounding the sudden addition, then loss, of a Hemingway cat to our family, I have no answers. But I still love and respect them all, mysterious as they are.  Robert F. Burges 
 RUNAWAY IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT MOVIES THAT SEEM TO GET OVERLOOKED OR THE CRITICS HATE IT. THE STORY IS WELL WRITTEN AND ACTED AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT. TOM SELLECK AND GENE SIMMONS [YES THE MAN FROM KISS] ARE BOTH EXCELLENT AND PLAY THE PARTS PERFECTLY WITH A LITTLE COMEDY THROWN IN THIS IS A WINNER! IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI ACTION MOVIES THEN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. CHECK OUT DEAD OR ALIVE WITH SIMMONS AND RUTGER HAUER ALSO. 
 This book hit on many topics and is a good reference book to use throughout the various stages of your divorce. Touches on a wide variety of things and generally answers some questions you might have. Some advice in this book I did not see in other divorce books such as what to do about debt in both of your names. Outlines what to do about credit card debt in both names as well as mortgage debt in both names. Mortgage debt is harder to get out of your name even if your spouse is awarded the asset. You are both still liable for mortgage debt until it is paid off or refinanced. Even if your divorce decree says that your former spouse is responsible for paying it. Book tells you how to communicate with credit card companies in regard to protecting your credit.    This book is worth reading because you will probably learn at least a few things you did not previously know 
 When I was 5 or 6 I liked to pretend I was an adult in a casino dealing cards.  I had a major obsession collecting playing cards.  I would ask my parents to buy me packs and packs of cards (each set with a different design).  I'd take the cards out of the box and place them all around my house.  All over the furniture, the TV set, EVERYWHERE!    Of course that eventually led to me wanting to learn how to play card games.  I learned many.  I grew up looking forward to summer evenings where I'd play cards with my family outside (and who can forget all the fun times we'd have trying to keep the cards still, so the wind wouldn't blow them away!)  It was a fun way to spend time with the family.  You couldn't ASK for a better way to spend time with the family, in fact.  One deck of cards can give you hours of fun because there's SO many games you can play.  I wouldn't pick up a deck of cards online because cards are cheap, so if you order playing cards online you're just going to end up paying money for shipping and handling which will jack the price up a lot when really, you can buy a deck somewhere close to your home for less than a dollar 
 In this eye-opening collection Susan Haack does, and encourages her readers to do, what everyone gives lip service to but rarely practices: examining one's assumptions on contemporary matters to see if they've been arrived at and are being held rationally...or accidently.  Accordingly such areas as feminism, multiculturalism, diversity, etc. are looked at, but here for a change scrutinized with a clear head and through fresh eyes.  It's not so much that Ms. Haack has an agenda as that she's concerned the search for truth in these areas pay heed to clear definition, logic, evidence, and proceed out of an unbiased sensibility.

 Why Absolute Sovereignty Can Not Offer Perpetual Peace -On the Desires of Men         In the Leviathan, Hobbes brings forward the theory that Commonwealths arise because without governments, people live in a state of nature with the constant danger of death. Furthermore, he believes that the best form of Commonwealth is one ruled by a monarch with absolute power; just like a person with two brains will not function, if the power of the monarch is not absolute, the commonwealth will fall back into the warring state of nature. When the sovereign power becomes truly absolute, Hobbes believes the Commonwealth could "live as long as mankind" unless attacked by foreign powers (p210).          Indeed, Hobbes is right in that life under any government is better than life with no government, and also that multiple powers inside one commonwealth will cause an end to the commonwealth. Nevertheless, he is wrong in asserting that absolute monarchy is the panacea for perpetual internal peace. There are two intrinsic flaws in the his system which are bound to push the commonwealth into the state of nature: one flaw is the unchecked greed of the monarch, another is caused by the unfulfilled desire for power of the subjects. Although this paper can not offer a better formula for governments, it will show that absolute monarchy does not provide the perpetual security that Hobbes promises.         First of all, extraordinary greed of the absolute ruler can break the Commonwealth. A ruler's greed can impoverish his subjects so abjectly that they no longer have enough food to survive on. Since the purpose of the commonwealth is to guarantee the security of life, and without food there is no life, the greed of the ruler will force the absolute Commonwealth to fall back into the state of nature.          Hobbes believes that the interest of the ruler and the interest of his subjects are so interdependent that the actions of the ruler will always be in the interest of his people. He writes,        "Now in monarchy the private interest is the same with the public...the riches, power, and honor of a monarch arise only from the riches, strength and reputation of his subjects." (P120)          Hobbes is right; the sovereign is the incorporation of its subjects, and so any injuries to the people are collectively an injury to the sovereign. Nevertheless, arising out of the great complications of the businesses of state and the wide expanse of a Commonwealth, there will always be a lag between when acts of the sovereign takes effect with people and when the sovereign feels the reactions of his people himself. A ruler with perfect prudence might be able to see through the gap and act in ways that are only ultimately good for the people and himself, but as Hobbes rightly observes, no one has perfect prudence (P14). This imperfect prudence becomes especially short-sighted when the ruler's reason is clouded by his present desires. Hobbes acknowledges these desires, for he says:          "And hence it is that kings, whose power is greatest, turn their endeavors to the assuring it at home by laws or abroad by wars; and when that is done, there succeeded a new desire, in some of fame from new conquest, in others of ease and sensual pleasures, in others of admiration or being flattered for excellence in some art or other ability of the mind." (p58)       So clouded by the lack of prudence and by excessive desires, the monarch might take actions that seem good at the moment for himself, but which turn out harmful for himself later. To illustrate this, let us observe the following scenario:        The new ruler of a poor but secured country builds a modest palace, for he has learnt from history books that he should not splurge. A couple years later, however, a desire for great things tempts him, and he wants to build a winter palace. He seeks advices from ten advisors, who had all the qualities that Hobbes praises (Chapter XXV); nine out of ten advisors privately dissuade the king from this luxury for a flood is raging and their nation is poor. Saddened, the king turns to the last advisor, who, seeing an opportunity to gain favor with the ruler, loudly exclaims that the other counselors do not love their king who needs a winter palace to escape the cold. The king happily agrees with him as his reason becomes clouded by desires; and soon, the construction begins.           Having gained favor, the 10th advisor convinces the ruler to imprison the other advisors for their "bad mouthing" of the king, making him the sole voice by the ruler's ear. As time goes on, the king exerts ever greater taxes on his people to pay for ever grander palaces, and every time, the advisor not only finds more elaborate excuses for the king but praises him for his greatness and also funnels some of the money for construction into his own coffer. The affairs of the nation are in utter neglect.         One night, the king remembers his father's warnings against indulgence, and he shakes with fear; but when he sees his gardens filled with singing girls half naked, lacking the prudence to see the future awaiting him, he says to himself, "I have been endowed differently by God, the fate of others can not be my own."          The poor people of this nation become more desperate by the day, yet the ruler who lives deep inside his palaces can not know their suffering. Some years later, the harvest is so bad that people have barely enough to feed themselves, yet the king sends his money collectors for even higher tax quotas. Realizing that they could either die of starvation or die fighting against the dictator with at least a chance to live, the farmers revolt. Hobbes would support them, for he writes, "the obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect hem." (P144)        When the farmers' army charges into his bed chamber, the king finally feels the injuries that he has done to the people and to himself, yet reason and prudence are too late.          Absolute sovereignty means absolute power, and as the old saying goes, "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." In fact, Hobbes acknowledges the greedy corruption of the monarchs, and even gives his justification. He writes,           "A man may here object that the condition of subjects is very miserable, as being obnoxious to the lusts and other irregular passions of him or them that have so unlimited a power in their hands...not considering that the estate of man can never be without some incommodity or other, and that the greatest that in any form of government can possibly happen to the people in general is scarce sensible, in respect of the miseries and horrible calamities that accompany a civil war." (P117)           Hobbes makes no mistakes here. Any government is better than no government, but as mentioned before, he makes the claim later that Commonwealths, "by the nature of their constitution they are designed to live as long as mankind" unless attacked by foreign powers (210). In the same chapter (XXIX), Hobbes attributes all the internal infirmities of the Commonwealth that shorten its "natural" life to variations of the lack of absolute power, but describes no infirmities when the Commonwealth is ruled by an absolute monarch. He thus makes it clear that if there is absolute power, then the commonwealth will "live as long as mankind" even if the monarch is corrupted. However, as shown in the illustration above, Hobbes' absolute monarchy does have tremendous infirmities.          Hobbes can, however, still argue that the previous illustration is an extreme example that barely happens in reality. Hobbes might say that if only the absolute sovereigns all studied the Leviathan carefully, they will always initiate policies for the interest of the people. Granted, Hobbes' excellent book can convert many, yet, even when the absolute sovereign is good and strong, the Commonwealth can still fall back into the state of chaos.         To Hobbes, the foremost law of nature is to find security ("a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive to his life" [P79]), but is survival the only thing that men search for? No. As Hobbes points out himself, survival is the means and not the ends of life. And while people all want to survive, they live for different ends of life as influenced by their education and upbringings. Hobbs indirectly talks about the fulfillment of some ends life when he writes,         "In such condition (of war) there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently, no culture of the earth, no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building" (p76)          For certain people, the end of their life lies in gaining political power-to be the ruler instead of the ruled. Hobbes indirectly recognizes people's "unnecessary" desire for power, when he writes (OL) "there are those who, from pride and a desire for glory, would conquer the whole world, which they pursue farther than their security requires." (P75)          This kind of desire, nevertheless, can not be fully satisfied in a state of absolute sovereignty. For one, the greatest prize of all, the prize of becoming your own sovereign is off-limits. Additionally, although those borne with the heart of Napoleon might be few, lower offices and positions in a state of absolute power come merely at the mercy of the sovereign-for one eager for any honor and position, his dream may never fly high because the sovereign can give the honor he deserves to someone else. As Hobbes says himself, "a man may be worthy of riches, office, and employment, that nevertheless can plead no right to have it before another, and therefore cannot be said to merit or deserve it." (p57)         For some, the limitation on of the fulfillment of their political dreams results in nothing other than the acceptance of their fates, yet history never fails to produce some who have the eagerness and bravery to challenge the ultimate authority and break the bondage of power.          Hobbes would call the act of such eager men anti-nature, since dissenters will almost certainly face unnatural deaths by the sword of the king, or face the danger of death by returning to the state of nature. However, again, survival is the means, not ends of life. The following example illustrates why people might endanger their means for their ends.          Colonized people have throughout history fought for independence against their colonial sovereigns. To Hobbes, these wars for independence must be irrational: for one, the colonized people could be enjoying many benefits either from direct aid or commercial links with their colonizer; additionally, hundreds of thousands of colonized people might die in the immediate war or during the consequent internal power struggles caused by the revolt. Yet, despite the "practical benefits" and the peace that the colonial sovereigns bestows upon the colonized, this smooth highway of subjugation is not the one that the people want; they desire for a road, smaller and rougher maybe, but one that is built by themselves to a destination that they determined for themselves. Thus, in their search for the power that is forbidden to them, they set out for the "unreasonable".          To be sure, Hobbes' Law of Nature still holds: on the battle fields, those who fight against the sovereign will always do all they could to triumph over their enemy and avoid death, but again, the need for survival is only a part of the story.         Regarding this fight for independence, Hobbes might say, as he writes, "those men that are so remissly governed that they dare take up arms to defend or introduce an opinion are still in war." (P113) This means that since the any revolutionaries must never have been a part of the commonwealth, and hence the commonwealth was only attacked from the outside and did not fall internally. Nevertheless, Hobbes also says that a monarch's "subjects" are delivered from their former obligation, and become obliged" to the victor in a war against their original sovereign. (P145) The new subjects of the monarch might have a high tendency toward revolting against ruler for the same reasons mentioned before, and in this case, Hobbes must certainly recognize that the revolutionaries are a part of the Commonwealth.        In the Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes dedicates himself to finding the best form of government, that perfect house which can last forever and provide eternal peace for all. The book is quiet admirable with its precise arguments and high ideals. Nevertheless, Hobbes ignores the fact that people will always willingly take actions that might hurt their security because they are either short-sighted or desire for something other than mere survival. Still, the Leviathan is a work of Epic proportion, and this essay does not find a form of government better than absolute sovereignty.        
 Michael Watkins offers counsel that is relevant to so many, yet is actually a subject of study for so few. In my lifetime I have changed companies no less than four times. Job titles have changed twice than many times.   Preparing for and performing well during times of change accounts for a large part of my career. And I think I am not alone. For those looking for nuggets of assitance in their own transition, this book is for you. But Watkins research is new and still evolving to maturity. Look for more and better things to come from him in the future.   Best about book: exercises and tests give chance for reflection and application to current environment, e.g. the personal problem preference test.   
 This is a good book, effective but not great.  The series of stories as told by the disenfranchised narrator is filled with keen observations and poignant vigneetes, together forming a good carricature of the suburban lifestyle during these safe, post Cold War years where spirituality dwindles.  I found the apocalyptic seres of vignette the most effective, as well as the relationship to the sister.  The ending is a bit of a let down, as Coupland didn't really have a run up to the conclusion, it just appeared as a stretch 
  This third work by Seirawan in his Winning CHess series is a truely great positional chess primer! I strongly advise that before diving into this work that the reader has an in depth understanding of tactics which was covered in Seirawan's Winning CHess Tactics, which is book #2 of this series.    The information in this work is a basic primer of the art of positional play for intermediate players looking to improve their play. One should make every effort to understand these basic concepts as it will provide you with a solid foundation as far as postional play and enable the reader at a later date to understand and digest more advanced works such as Nimzowitch's 'My System,' various pawn structure books, and the games collections of GM's such as Capablanca, Petrosian, Karpov, etc. This intro book into positional play by Seirawan is the best by far... 
 This ranks right up there with the Greats, which of course, Johnny Winter is.  This is probably my most favorite Johnny Winter CD ever. And I have em all.  Johnny Winter And comes in a close second. The years and hard road can be heard in his voice but the raw emotion is better than ever.  His guitar work has just slightly mellowed in a most wonderful way.  Slide guitar, as always, superb!  About half the tunes were penned by either Johnny or members of the band, which is also superb! Rock On Johnny! 
 I enjoy the workout it is great for home use when you cannot get out of the house or when it is too cold 
 Such a wonderful book especially to beginners in the area of sex therapy. I would recommend to ALL clinicians dealing with sexual health problems to read the book. It surely change my approach in managing patients with sexual difficultie 
 It is a little pricey but so worth it to me! I had a ruddy and uneven skin tone on my face and this has worked wonders for me. I love this product! It really does what it says! 
 This book has been life changing in healing my Mother's brain injuries after a trauma in an accident with a tractor trailer. Having read the book, I took his music for healing to her hospital ICU and instructed the nurses to keep the music on at all times. I literally watched her come out of a coma, first tapping her toes to the music, then her fingers, then humming.  In the unsettling sounds of a hospital, this gave her calm and focused on the area of healing where she needed it most.  Personally, anytime I want to be focused, I also use Don Campbell's music.  It works 
 I have never written a review before, but as this book is one of the funniest things I've ever stumbled upon... here goes. I was lucky enough to find Without Feathers about 10 years ago, in a hardcover edition along with Getting Even and Side Effects. I decided to take a quick look through it on the drive home from the book store (I was'nt the one driving!) and within minutes I was laughing uncontrolably! After the first paragraph I simply could'nt put it down. The other people in the car demanded to know what was so funny, but my attempts to read out loud were useless as I was crying with laughter and could no longer see the page!?! I handed the book over to one of my friends for him to read, and eventually we had to pull the car off the road due to the histerical giggling that ensued! "A Brief, Yet Helpful, Guide To Civil Disobedience" is possibly the funniest thing I've ever read!?! A decade has gone by since I first read these books and they are still as funny and unique. I read them whenever I'm dangerously close to forgeting how cathartic sheer silliness can be! Truly joyful prose 
 A well written, concise, value packed book brilliantly illustrating CTI's Co-Active model of coaching. A "must have" manual for professional coaches providing all the materials, exercises. and concepts of this extraordinary coaching model. Thanks to Laura Whitworth, Henry Kimsey-House, and Phil Sandahl for this invaluable model! I've used it in my coaching business for the past 6 years and it is constantly expanding. 
 Join this charming chameleon on the road to discovery where he searches for a "color of his own."  He learns to adapt to different "colored" environments while feeling left out, and along the way befriends a fellow chameleon and gains lasting companionship and happiness.  This delightful board book captures babies attention with simple content and colorful illustrations, while teaching young children about feelings of belonging, friendship, compassion, and the most obvious - colors: green, red, gray, pink, yellow, and purple.  This is a terrific tale!  One-year and up 
 David Foster Wallce is a central figure of the contemporary literary scene. As such, he is predictably controversial. His epic novels like Infinite Jest and his metaficitional short stories are loved or hated... or like me both loved and hated. When his fiction hits it is some of the best writing out there. Other times it misses its mark and just descends into a pointless headgame (but is still at least mildly entertaining).   I know lots of writers and readers and they will debate endlessly about his fiction. What they won't debate, however, is his Non-fiction. Everyone loves it. I don't know anyone who has read "A Supposedly Fun Thing" and not laughed out loud and loved it.   As another reviewer noted, the three strongest essays are the titular one (about his experiences on a cruise ship), the state fair one (much the same as the first in style and humor) and the brillant essay on irony in the TV age.   But the other essays (on proffesional tennis, david lynch, "the death of the author" argument and other things) are well worth reading, even if they aren't quite as utterly brillant as the first three, and especially worth reading for anyone interested in their subject matter.   So if you like humorous journalism at all, do yourself a favor and buy this. 
 Lovely book with beautiful illustrations. It's nice to know that Vegemite is useful for something 
 Polanski explores the mental universe of a young girl who finds any kind of sexual contact most repelent. Catherine Deneuve plays Carole, a young French girl who lives with her older sister in London.She works as a manicurist and sees her sister's sexual life as something extremely repulsive: She can't stand her boyfriend who leaves his toothbrush in her glass,not to mention the fact that he is married.Carole is  left alone in the London flat after her sister leaves for a short holiday in Italy. Soon enough, Carole is the subject of byzarre experiences which eventually lead her to commit atrocious crimes.Polanski masterfuly takes the audience on a strange journey through this girl's mental decay.The acting is great and the story very original and avant garde for its time. Nevertheless, the DVD treatment itself is not worth a dollar.The movie wasn't at all restaured: the image is grainy, blurry at times,jumpy.The sound is terrible.The DVD comes in Fullscreen which is also very annoying, and forget about special features like trailers or subtitles because simple there are none. Hopefully some smart studio will take the time to restaure this cult classic and deliver it in a decently treated DVD in the future.. 
 Even though this music was written for a video game (a damn good game I might add), it is every bit as professional as anything you'd see in a cd store. Nobuo Uematsu has the ability to write music that absolutely gushes emotion, and most of the renditions on this CD do the songs justice. From the melancholy of Terra's theme to the insanity of Kefka's theme, you'll be moved as if by a magic spell by Nobuo Uematsu's magic wand of music. Worth every penny 
 Saki (H.H. Munro) writes with a facility and style that guides the reader unerringly to the surprise denouement in which propriety is set on its head. His bitingly clever turns of phrase are made bearable by his eagerness to challenge and thwart the norms of society. 
 I have tried literally every diet book out there - Fat Flush, South Beach, Zone, Body For Life - and Weight Watchers numerous times.  The only diet that has ever worked for me is SMD.  I went on it in desperation 3 years ago and lost 25 lbs in about 6 weeks.  I kept all the weight off until I got pregnant two years ago.  With 15 baby pounds left to lose, I'm going back on next week!  Tips:  - You WILL be Desperately Hungry, despite what the good doctor says, especially for the first 3 days or so until you adjust.  Try diet sodas to help assuage this. -  You must exercise.  I found that I did not lose weight on the days that I didn't run a couple of miles.  The diet is very low calorie and your metabolism will adjust accordingly if you don't kick it into gear. -  The "Fruit salad every day" may hinder your weight loss.  If you're using the alternative lunch with no problem, ignore this one.  But I found I often didn't lose weight on the days I used the fruit salad alternative.  Best of luck 
    Like his other series The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, these books seem to be of the "light mystery" variety with intriguing and believable characters.  Isabel Dalhousie, the heroine of the series, is a fallible protagonist--a refreshing change from so many heroines.  McCall Smith successfully narrates a woman's perspective by treating it more as a generalized "human" perspective.   	While the story follows a mystery surrounding a heart-transplant recipient, it explores more universal themes such as the pursuit of love and the assumptions we make about each other, as well as the bonds of friendship. The book is sweet without being saccharine. A worthy read 
 Everyone likes a kebab after a night out on the sauce. Patty Reed liked them more than other people. "The Story of the Donner Party" is the latest offering from the much-maligned Louise Baldwin, and is a riotous romp of Dickensianesque farce, set as it is in turn-of-the-19th-century California. With her flowery prose and powerful metaphors, Baldwin takes us on a warts-and-all ride through an eventful evening in Ms Reed's life. There's murder, intrigue and suspense. Gasp for breath as Ms Reeds loyal friend Lauren chokes to death on some of that white stuff you sometimes find in the mixed salad you get at 'bab shops. Is it cabbage? I think it's cabbage. It might be cabbage but I'm not sure. Where I live, it'd be kohl-rabi. Anyway. Cry fat, sympathetic tears of white-hot laughter as Derek drunkenly says "yes" and ends up with chili sauce on his kebab, but smiles gamely as he forces himself to eat it to win honour amongst his gnarled gold-digger compatriots. Twitch with suspicion as Patty finds "mint sauce" on the collar of her husbands shirt collar. Is it mint sauce, or toothpaste? Or something more sinister? You'll find out when you buy this whirlwind adventure romance novel book. Patty Reed's Doll: The Story of the Donner Party contains small parts and may have been assembled in a factory where nuts are processed. A rip-roaring read. Top marks! 
 The Cultural Creatives describes the great social transformation that has already started and the people who are making it happen (a majority of whom are women, no surprise to me!) I'm definitely a CC. What is astonishing is that so many people share the new values and new way of life without realizing there are millions of others who are like us. This is a truly fascinating and enlightening study of American culture in the process of change.  You will come away with hope for a brighter future as we cope with this difficult transition to a saner, wiser culture. We women must lead the way. 
 This album may contain only 3 of the original members but it still gives a feeling of some good ole southern Band music. Eric Clapton's  appearance is also welcomed 
 I'm so bummed I only got this now, in 2006.  If I would have stumbled on it in the mid 80s when it came out, I could have been enjoying it all these years.  The whole album is very solid; the second song stands out as the best (to me) and is on my short list of all-time best songs.  
 I found this book to be invaluable in clearing the factual fog around the original Rosicrucians. The author was a scrupulous and brilliant historian who has not, as far as I can find, been seriously challenged on her major conclusions by another scholar of similar standing and specialty. The reviewers of this book who claim Dames Yates made "HUGE assumptions" and "misinterpretations" do not cite sources for these claims. Not to do so is, at best, a disservice and at worst, indicative that the sources are not of the same caliber as Dame Yates 
 This book was great! It explains the reasoning behind why and how all the current attractions were constructed. I would have liked to see a little more on the past and the potential for future attractions, but it was good. They spent a considerable amount of time on world showcase and not as much on future world.  Also, forced perspective is one of the strong topics - they must explain it 5 times.  Regardless of the disappointments, it was overall an interesting look into the concepts of what went into Epcot 
 Annie Sprinkles very personal heart felt Spectacular Sex Guide inspires us into our sexual potential giving us the tools for sexual transformation. Even if we already have a satisfying sex life there are many interesting exercises here to try. I can relate to Annie's libraries of sexual experience even though I have not taken as many adventures as her. Really folks if some of us turned off our TVs and used that time to further our sexual awareness there would be a great possibility for personal sexual freedom. My favorite quote would be "Don't worry; be horny." Now that this wonderful book has been put on sale there couldn't be a better time to buy it 
 I found this work on McArthur the best objective opinion of this military "icon" written to date.  It was appropriate and necessary for such a work to be written by an academic historian who was not an American in order to obtain an objective view of such a controversial man in American history.  I would like to see the author write a similar analysis of McArthur's generalship in the Korean conflict.  I think the author could have gained a more complete understand of the reduction of the Air Corps forces if he had reviewed the fine article by Richard Slater found in the November 1987 issue of Airpower Magazine 
 Ms. Margonelli has presented an excellently researched story giving the truth about the oil industry from the local gasoline station making a few cents on a gallon of gasoline and living on the sale of cigarettes, condoms and candy up through the chain of the distributors, the refiners, to the big oil companies). It then takes a side trip through the financial side of the business at the NYMEX 'Oil Pit.' From there it's a visit to some of the big producing countries like Venezuela, Iran, and on to China where the dramatic upserge in demand caused the recent spike in $3 a gallon gasoline.   This is as realistic a view of the way oil is brought to market as I have ever seen. It is in sharp contrast to the people writing the letters to the newspaper who consistently blame the big oil companies.   It is not until you get to the Epilogue that she shares her thinking about the future. She realizes that the long term future of energy is not with oil. She says: 'The United States could put its considerable money and political will into creating new kinds of vehicles and fuels, while creating incentives to use fossil fuels more efficiently.' Unfortunately, when I listen to our politicians, I don't hear anything about such things. Perhaps lip service as in the state of the union message, but no action 
 I can't say enough good things about this book.  It is beautifully written and a complete inspiration.  I feel fortunate to have the guidance presented in this book.  It is fantastic 
 Just want to let you all know that the lid of this 4-1/2 quart pan also fits the 9-1/2" inch Tarte Tatin/Anniversary pan ...     I wanted to buy a small Buffet Casserole (the 2-quart size) to cook chicken & rice or pork chops when it's just my husband and myself, but I decided to buy the Tarte Tatin/"Anniversary" pan (same pan, two different names) instead for two reasons:    1) One less lid in the cupboard  2) I thought the shape of the anniversary pan's flat bottom would be a little bit more useful (I can make Tarte tatin of course, but also: regular cakes (come out delicious, just line this pan with parchment paper -- the cake comes out so perfect you may throw away your cake pans to make space for more Le Creuset cookware, lol), quiche/one pot breakfasts, etc.    Because I can use a lid on top of the anniversary pan, I can also use that anniversary pan to cook dishes with rice in them, poach chicken breats, etc.    Of course, read all the other reviews about this 4-1/2 quart size pan. It's the perfect size pan to cook meals for 6 people.     FYI: If you are trying to decide what size to buy, just to let you know Le Creuset recommends that you choose a pan size where the contents of what you are trying to cook fills the pan at least 50%, if not three-quarters of the way full to the top, to make the most of the radient heat qualities of cast iron (with this cast iron pan, the heat not only travels through the bottom of the pan, but also up the sides -- very different from your usual stainless steal or alumninum pan, which is why you use lower heat with these pans than with stainless steel pans).     If you use too large of a pan, your ingredients may dry out before they are cooked all the way through. Also, if you are cooking rice, if there is too much space at the top (if your pan is only 25 percent full), you may not get enough steam pressure to cook the rice all the way through.    If this is your first pan, get the size of pan you'll use the most of the time, not the size you use when you cook for company. These pans are so addictive, you'll can always buy the bigger size later for specialty recipes.    This 4-1/2 quart is perfect for cooking for 3 to 6 people.    The 3-1/2 quart is perfect for 2 to 4 people.    The 2-1/2 quart is good for 1 or 2 people, or rice for 4 people 
 I've recently discovered and began to enjoy Nora Roberts' books. 'Private Scandals' kept me entertained, but the identity of the stalker/obsessive fan/murderer was easy to figure out, since I'm HORRIBLE at solving mysteries and my guess turned out to be correct. The book did drag at spots, certain things became repetitive and were more in depth than necessary. The abundance of sex scenes became annoying. I don't think that for normal couples, every little kiss morphs into a ridiculously passionate lovemaking session, but then again, this was in part a romance novel. But these parts were not necessary to the plot and I began skimming over them after a few. Other facets of the book were somewhat far-fetched, but again, it's fiction. Worth reading, but check it out from the library instead of purchasing the book 
 This advice for writing serial romances, alternately attributed to Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, and Charles Reade, is epitomized in this 1860 novel by Collins, a story of thwarted love, a marriage of obligation, claims on inheritance, the victimization of women, and, most of all, engaging mystery.  Collins, often credited as the father of the mystery genre, creates a fast-paced story of Victorian England, revealing much about Victorian society and its values--the role of women, the laws governing marriage and inheritance, the social institutions of the day, the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes, and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness.  When drawing master Walter Hartright is on his way to teach Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie at Limmeridge House, in Cumberland, England, he meets a "woman in white," a young woman who knows Limmeridge House well because she was mentored by Mrs. Fairlie, Laura Fairlie's deceased mother.  The "woman in white" is Anne Catherick, who looks just like Laura, but who is an escapee from a nearby mental asylum.  Upon his arrival at Limmeridge House, Walter immediately falls in love with the beautiful Laura, but she has made a deathbed pledge to her father to marry to Sir Percival Glyde, someone Anne Catherick despises and blames for her own incarceration.  Throughout the novel, Anne visits various characters to offer help in combating Sir Percival and his cohorts.  The story unfolds through documents held by a variety of characters, each of whom tells the story from his/her own point of view.  The reader develops sympathy for the innocent and beautiful Laura, respect for her homely but bright half-sister, Marian Halcombe, sadness for Walter Hartright, and hatred for Sir Percival and his friend, the Italian count Fosco, with whom Sir Percival is in business.  Sir Percival and the count need financing, and it is Laura's inheritance that is at stake.  A series of consecutive disasters, along with arguments, revelations of abuse, the fear of exposure, and the contemplation of murder by Sir Percival and Count Fosco, draws the reader irrevocably into the action.  The characters are sympathetically drawn, with Collins showing an early awareness of the influence of psychology on behavior.  The descriptions of nature, presented realistically and in  minute detail, build suspense, as Collins creates parallels between nature and the details of plot.  As is usually the case with romances, chance plays a huge role in the unfolding action, creating cliff-hanging suspense which contributes to the excitement--and pure fun--of this seductive novel.  The conclusion, involving a subplot unrelated to the primary action, resolves issues conveniently.  The almost-forgotten author of twenty-five novels, Collins was one of the most successful authors of Victorian mysteries, and he is gaining new attention as a result of reprints of this novel and The Moonstone.  n Mary Whipple  
 This book is not an easy read.  It does take some brain thought or you will be lost.  Although I did find it very interesting and factual.  I would pass it onto those who take the bible as the 'only' word.  This book shows that there is other documentation out there and the author has done his homework.  A must read for those who want to know more about who's who in the bible 
 I saw the film at a young age.  Never forgot it then Oops I wanted to read the book, books are always different than the movie 
 This book tells it straight about the butchest dog there is. You can't say fairer than that. 
 A good book, but it's kind of deep if you are not a Math major.  I'm an Engineer and a Computer Scientist, and while it was not as tough as Calculus book, it was not light reading.  But hey- Any book that considers God and Newton, in the same chapter is not a coffee table book.  Stewart's writing and the thoughts presented require serious thought, and a pad and pencil at your side are clearly helpful here.  It is refreshing to see that writers like Stewart recognize the clarity of great thinkers like Newton, and Einstein, et al. and their recognition of God 
 Seven years of LBJ's life are covered in this volume commencing in 1941.  Desperate fear drove Johnson, and in 1941 he lost a race for a senate seat to Pappy O'Daniel.  He no longer looked like a winner.  He did not want to be like his idealistic, romantic father--rigidly honest.  Lyndon Johnson thought it was humiliating to let someone else steal an election from him.  FDR told him he had to learn that when the election is over, sit on the ballot boxes.    Johnson ridiculed politicians who fought for ideas and principles.  Pearl Harbor prevented him from pursuing a senatorial seat in 1942.   Johnson was a naval reserve officer.  He made it seem as if he would be called upon to fight, but he angled for a stateside position after he learned that absent training he would have no leadership role in the armed forces.  Roosevelt was focused on Stalingrad and Guadalcanal and thus was not available to support Johnson in his political squabbles.    In the House, as in the war, Johnson was not allowed to lead.  He gave no speeches and introduced no bills.  He grabbed for money.  His means was a radio station, KTBC in Austin.  At first it was a sundowner and employees wondered from day to day when it would go out of business.  Johnson got an option to purchase the station by luck, salesmanship, and an appointment to a service academy he had supplied.  The FCC was to approve the sale to Mrs. Johnson.    In the future there would be a galaxy of television and radio stations.  In 1943 Lyndon Johnson, through his link to Sam Rayburn, helped the FCC survive congressional scrutiny.   Johnson told the employees of the station to work hard and to be loyal.  The employees saw the way Johnson treated Lady Bird.  Salaries were low and hours were long.  Johnson liked power best and he was really happier in politics than business where he had to suit his customer in order to sell radio time.  After Roosevelt's death Johnson was no longer an insider.    In 1948 a former governor of Texas, Coke Stevenson, ran in the Democratic primary for the senatorial seat.  Robert Caro portrays him admiringly for reason of his incorruptibility.  Self-educated, he suffered from a narrow viewpoint.  He was a segregationist, an inexcusable position in today's terms.  In 1948 Johnson used George Parr, boss of Duval County, to help round up votes for him.  Johnson was also helped in the Valley by the machinations of Alvin Wirtz.  Caro's tone in much of the book, (which  is natural given his informants), is that of a Texas storyteller.  Johnson campaigned with a helicopter, the Johnson City Windmill and its smaller successor, and people gathered to see the contraption.    In the run-off primary the Johnson campaign was even more brash and money-ridden. After the polls closed and the votes were counted, George Parr announced that through oversight the votes had not been counted for one of the precincts.  New votes would be coming in from the Valley.  Seventy two hours after the polls closed was a deadline and at that point Stevenson had a lead of three hundred or so votes.  The lead was reduced and when Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County filed an amended return, Johnson was in the lead by 87 votes.    Johnson worked to prevent box 13 from being opened.  Alvin Wirtz obtained a restraining order.  Later to avoid a hearing on the substance of the voting irregularity charge, Johnson's lawyers, through a strategy devised by Abe Fortas, successfully sought a stay of the proceedings from Justice Black.  Johnson did prevail and became known as 'Landslide Lyndon'.   Caro interviewed a number of people concerning the mysterious ballot box.  Even knowing the outcome the reader savors the details put forth in such entertaining and masterly fashion by Robert Caro.                   
 this is wonderful!!My children love it , they listen to the CD over and ove 
 If Bowie and company do not win a Grammy for this there is no justice.  The performance is outstanding, the band is hot, and the song selection essential.  Bowie has always been ahead of his peers in the use of video and this one is a masterpiece of sight and sound.  The lighting is incredible whether it was there in the arena at the time of the concert or added later.  The effects are added succinctly reflecting and enhancing the natural movement of the performers on stage (and you can actually see them), the reactions of the audience (contrasting views of those right in front with angles revealing the size and architecture of the arena itself), and in conjunction with the stage and arena lighting creating micro-universes on portions of the stage serving to delineate singer and musicians in a multitude of stances.              Bowie is more comfortable with his band and his audience than I have ever seen him.  He's having a great time even with the oldest tunes which he has performed thousands of times before.  The show benefits from the inclusion of several tunes from Bowie's latest release, Reality, which is one of the five best recordings of his illustrious career.              In one song he intones (as only Bowie can), "I believe in the Beatles."  The truth is, Bowie is a genius and the greatest rock and roll performer of his time which began near the end of the Beatles time.  They are the only rock and roll act to equal Bowie and, maybe, surpass him simply because they stand as the originators.  However, for all their amazing songwriting and transcendent influence they were never a live act in the sense which David Bowie is.  And he still outstrips all that have come since in both areas: songwriting and live performance 
 I'll admit it...I'm a game design student who likes to read and is therefore obviously partial to books related to the video game industry.  I have an ever-growing library of texts on many different areas within the context of games.  Books on the history of Nintendo, books about breaking into the industry, books about good design techniques etc... I do research online, read industry news, and overall try to read up on what people who are already in the industry have to say about it.  Having said that, I also take the things I read with a grain of salt.  You can't believe everything that you read; as the saying goes.  However, I do feel that the best way to expand your own thinking is to be open-minded to what other people are saying.  And it is with that open mind that I read Sheri Ray's book.  I must say, that there were plenty of times while reading where I thought to myself, `wow, I never saw it that way before.'  For me, these are enjoyable discoveries.  I like to stumble upon little things that affect the way I look at things.  Sheri did a wonderful job of capturing my attention, and providing me with little discoveries about why men and women are attracted to games.  I enjoyed her examples and would love to see other authors go in this direction.    After reading her book, I look at games in a different manner now.  I pick out the visual stimulus, the inclusion of puzzle elements, and whether targets are moving in an uncluttered field or not.  Looking at them now, the games I play have seamlessly included elements that make me enjoy them more.  The things that Sheri points out are nice to have in the back of your mind when thinking about games.  Even though many of us will never have a concept that gets made into a game, we might be working on a title that someone else has envisioned and help it move towards capturing a larger market.  I recommend this book as an eye opener for those of us stuck in our own thoughts about what makes a good game good.  While it is not possible to appeal to every market with one game, if we'd like to design a game to appeal to more females, then reading Sheri's book and doing other related research can definitely move us in the right direction 
 Nice little 3-AAA light for the price,not sure of the runtime though I would guess its about 2 hours near 75-100 percent and then run for about 2-3 hours at a steady decline this is my best guess dont hold me to it though.The 8 LED's are bright its pretty compact about as wide as your palm and roughly 1.25 in diameter,I like it has an octangular shape and will sit without rolling in or on a nightstand.Its a good light at home but not sure of its weather proofing I'm not sure how well it would do or how reliable in wet weather therefor i I would not use it on the road and surely not in military/police lighting.4 stars for for it neat design and brightnes 
 Having read all of Alice Medrich's books (chocolate goddess), I came to this book with lower expectations but this book delivers way beyond what I could hope for. Not only are the photos much nicer, the directions and commentary are totally nuetral, taking on a practical and sincere approach for the reader. The recipes are really good too. Highly recommend 
 There are many, many resources out there these days that will tell you all about coaching basketball. A simple  google search will conjure up a plethora of books, CD, DVD, VHS and website material. It can be a bit  overwhelming to a new coach, so I hope this review is successful in pointing you to a great place to start your coaching education or adding to what you are already teaching your players.  What makes Coach Mullaney's new book, "The Complete Guide to Girls' Basketball", stand out from the crowd? Well,  there are three distinctive features that set this book apart from its peers.  First, this is a beautifully crafted book. Having been involved with publishing most of my life, I truly  appreciate the artistry and care given to the organization and layout. Every page has been professionally prepared  with relevant pictures, humorous quotes and detailed diagrams. The ease of use is about as good as a book can get.  The pictures are sharp and full of action, the quotes will keep you chuckling and looking forward to the following page, and the diagrams clearly explain the drills.  Second, this is a basketball coaching resource devoted to girls. How often do you see that? I think Coach Mullaney found a very important niche in the coaching resource market. Consider how many coaches are really a daughter's devoted dad who is challenged not only with teaching basketball, but also with reaching out to a group of young  ladies. Not many men have strong experience in that special arena, but Coach Mullaney does. The Complete Guide to Girls'  Basketball offers a coaching philosophy, drills and strategies that have been proven effective by the success of his girls teams. He even includes a section on rules that differ for womens play.  Third, and perhaps the feature that will matter most to you, is that The Complete Guide to Girls' Basketball really is complete. From basic footwork techniques to basic practice plans to game strategies, its all there.  In fact, don't get your nose up in the air if you coach boys. Every one of the 200+ drills, and all of the discussed  fundamental skills will benefit your team, too. It is a thorough textbook for the novice coach and is destined to become the well-worn companion of the more experienced coach as well.(... 
 I agree the green really isn't green but it's great. I love it because the black grill covers show all the dust and  dirt and this doesn't.  The color is wonderful. Great heavy duty cover.  Quality is great.... 
 I have seen the movie and bought the sound track. Having marinated my bones and psyche with Tibetans for over 25 years this soundtrack unites two ostensiby disparate cultures, America and Mongolia. As music is the one art form that transcends cultures, it is intersteing to hear the Blues united with their Asian cousins. The phenomenon of throat singing is what you have heard in Tibetan Monks chanting with the  ability to produce two tones simultaneously. Paul Pena, a black,  blind, blues singer from California, copped their gig and taught  himself how to do this. He went to Tuva and won their annual throat singing contest in his category. It is an exposure of the  roots. Like Mongolians don't get the Blues. For any armchair anthropoligist, this cd is a must. The movie will make you cry as you see the challenges that Paul faces, distantly empowered by the deceased physicist, Richard Feinman, who went to Tuva on his  last journey. Paul's trip is peppered with stickers that they  paste up, " Feinman Lives" Feinman was a great thinker from Far Rockaway, N.Y. who collected stamps from Tuva as a child. This record is strange and profound. Irresistable for any thinking person 
 I really enjoyed reading this book! I had a hard time putting the book down. Very neat ending. 
 This book is right up there with all the rest of the Janet Evanovich books. Once you read all 12 .. you just feel like you have to go back and start over again.. They are THAT good ! 
 Mr. Lynch points out the basic investing principles while recounting events that have helped shape his strategy. He presents the material in an approachable manner that gives a glimpse into the world of investing from his own personal perceptive. It is refreshing to see how he is susceptible to the same emotional highs and lows that the market throws at us all and to learn from his many years of experience.  
 Before reading Shock Value, I'd read John's other book - Crackpot - and found it to be extremely witty and insightful.  He seems very humble and able to communicate with anyone.  I like this book Shock Value, however I am giving it 4 stars b/c I would rather not see images and snapshots.  I'd rather just have had a full book I could read. Also, I didn't find his career-oriented to be interesting. 
 This movie or documentary what ever you may want to call it (cause it's so weird) is not about supporting prostitutes, but more about the reason/situations that lead to and exist, in such a "profession" word-wide. The element of documentary and fiction was a different take on the subject. If the fictional part of the story was just as candid and raw as the documentary portion, then the film would've been better. The subtitles were some what distracting due to the speed. I REALLY LOVE WHEN THE MAN ASKED DENISE RICHARDS IF SHE MASTERBATES AND SHE SAID "SOMETIMES" I WAS LIKE "OOOOHHH MAN!! 
 This CF card is perfect for anybody who needs a high capacity (e.g. for hi-res pics) but doesn't care about the transfer speed. It may be a bit annoying though - especially if you try to download all the 2GBs from the card to your hard drive because it takes some time. I do still consider it a real good purchase ; 
 I saw Kate Bush in a dream last night, for only the second time (the first was before the release of _The Sensual World_). This is why I am here now.  I first heard Kate Bush on the radio while on the graveyard shift at work, in 1985.  I was intrigued by the unusual sound of the music, and for a wonder, the DJ actually gave the name of the song, the album, and the artist -- it was Kate Bush singing "Running Up that Hill" on _Hounds of Love_.  I went and bought the album, and though it didn't hugely impress me at first, it grew on me.  The music on this album has a cryptic mysterious quality that one finds only in the greatest of art.    All of Kate's albums are at least very good, but this one is the best, and is my all-time favorite (see review title).  There is a remastered edition of this CD with bonus tracks, but the original edition maintains an artistic unity which in my opinion is vitiated by the extra material.  You would do well to buy either.   
 I've read all of John's books (except the collections) and so was excited to see him coming out with another one and even more so since it's in a new genre for him.  I got it early in electronic format (why read it any other way) and really enjoyed it.  He does a great job of making the kid true to life.  So many times when authors try to take the perspective of kids it's very unbelievable to me because their thoughts / behaviors aren't like any kids I know ... and I've got 4 so I have some knowledge.  I like the way he twists a number of standard fairy tales and weaves them together in the book.  He also does a good job of addressing things like jealousy and how our limited perspective affects our attitude.  The book is really good as a tale and it has good issues / thoughts to ponder "beneath" the tale.  A good read.  Keep up the good work John 
 This book has me speechless.  I have read a ton of Wyrmish literature put out by White Wolf in my time, including the Book of the Wyrm, and I must say that I learned more from this book than all the rest.  This is truely  one excellent book and a great prop to have around.  The only reason this  book did not receive 5 stars from me was because of the rather dry  Victorian story about the paranormal investigator, but the typed report in  the back nearly makes up for it.. 
 This was my absolute favorite book growing up - we had a whole collection of Dr Seuss books, along with fairy tales, nursery rhymes, Leo Leonni - and Wacky Wednesday was my favorite.  As an adult looking back, I believe this book - above all others - tuned into both my creative side and my analytical/detailed/detective side.  My poor parents who hoped for a doctor - I graduated with a degree in English and cite Dr Suess as my main influence.  I'm very happy to be have found this book again + buy it for my toddler today, who is also creative and analytical.  Yes, you'll find more wacky things than said to be there, but this carries the book further out of the realm of your typical neat little story, and encourages people + kids to use their brains to always be looking further 
 Fournel takes Hemmingway, puts him on a bike, and implants a French sensibility. The words a spare, the pieces short, but each is a declarative taste of life on two wheels, including the times your mind wanders from the road and into the passing scenery. You'll drown in the tar, greet the car door, and meet the man with the hammer. If you love to ride, you have to have this book. If you could care less about bicycling, but like to read outstanding imagery in prose, you won't be dissapointed either 
 I wish the author had been allowed the time to finish the project the way I believe he would have wanted to 
 I'm giving it 5 stars, guys. I don't give 5 stars.  This is my favorite release by AFI. To explain why concisely, it came out between Black Sails and The Art of Drowning, and, while I love TAD, my complaint about it is that it's noticably slower, and less punk, than BSS. All Hallows keeps the speed and strength but includes the melody and variety (not between songs, but within them) of TAD that was lacking in BSS. It was one step in the band's evolution, and I wished that they had lingered there a little longer.  It is far too short. So I listen to it over and over.  Buy it now 
 This Priestess and author has outdone herself....AGAIN!  Covencraft is an invaluable tool for anyone interested in starting a coven (or worship space).  Full of complete and comprehensive instruction (with examples) to getting your 501(c)3 status.  This book is a staple in any Pagan's library.  Highly recommended without reservation 
 I just wanted to point out the inaccuracy of the Publisher's Weekly review. John "Doc" Bradley was a Navy Corpsman, not a Marine. If you ask a leatherneck who they consider true heroes on the battlefield, it would have to be the brave corpsmen that stand by them.  
 This is a great resource for aspiring reporters and for those who have been in the business for just a couplle of years. Mr. Arya presents a straight forward - honest look at what it takes to be a good live reporter in a very difficult field. The tips are very valuable to students and those  just starting out in this field. They are also good to those who are  working in live television but who are uncomfortable with the live  presentation. This is a nice resource for all live reporters - a reminder  of what it takes to make it work successfully 
 Book is just amazing, after reading some critical reviews, my expectations been quit low. But when I got the book on Friday I could not let my fingers from it the whole week end.. 
 An indespensible reference for everything client-side web development.  Consise and handy; this book should sit beside the keyboard of any serious web developer 
   The smallest literary form--haiku -- is at its best in this powerful book. If you've ever wanted to improve your writing or understanding of life, read The Open Gate. This haiku journal presents amazing imagery drawn from intensely careful observations. The poems evoke an enormous range of moods and emotions -- from compassion to awareness of temporality. Some reveal a sense of mystery, others reflect a Zen Buddhist influence. Some are witty or sarcastic, others, achingly sad. Haiku of this quality in English are very rare.  J. C.  Greene is a modern master.  Reading his poems is like Basho's famous leaping frog, plunging into water, each brief poem expanding in ever-widening ripples. 
 Having owned THE NEW SENSUAL MASSAGE and enjoyed its beautiful techniques with my loved ones, I was delighted to discover this book and DVD package which makes the learning process even easier. The Art of Sensual Massage is probably the most famous massage book out there. We got it as a wedding gift and really put it to good use. What a great experience sensual massage is! This is apparently a new edition with better photos and printing. The DVD fits right in with the techniques described in the book...almost page by page.  It's packaged inside the book. It's really fun to use them together. We have recommended this package to several friends and based on the enthusiastic responses, will continue to do so.   The bottom line: if you want to learn and really ENJOY massage, get this package. You won't regret it 
    I have read several books that attempt to help adult children of abusive (verbal or physical) parents, but most authors fail to connect with me because they feel a need to give the most horrible stories and examples in their books.  My father didn't sexually molest me or tell me to die, but he did constantly belittle me with subtle remarks, jokes, criticisms.                                         This book spends over 100 pages giving stories and examples of all kinds of toxic parents,not just the ones that make the most horrifying read.  It seems  a little vague and scattered at first, because there are so many different examples of so many different types of toxic parental abuse, then you realize that most of the symptoms of the adult child who has suffered, are the same.  Children of alcoholics, molestors, belittlers, hitters, all share a commond bond of lacking an identity, and struggling with their self esteem, and fighting a rage deep inside them.      The second half of the book is the most impressive.  The author is surprisingly and refreshingly realistic in her advice on how to start healing.  She conveys that it is ok to feel whatever emotion you are feeling, because it is an emotion.  She sheds a brilliant light on the act of forgiveness, and how the general concept of "total forgiveness" is not always best with toxic parents.        It was just a well written and realistic book that I think will appeal to all adult children who had or have "toxic" parents 
 Joseph Wambaugh joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1960. This first novel is about a policeman's life, neither exaggerated or white-washed. The chapters tell about the experiences of three recruits as a collection of stories. This book is a product of the changes of the 1960s. I don't believe it could have been published ten years earlier. Chapter 1 explains the choke-hold: it can disable or kill. A man who resists and doesn't fight back is a problem for even two bigger policemen. Whoever endures will win. Shooting a target is difficult, even if it doesn't shoot back. Chapter 2 tells about the stress interview, and its mysteries. In Chapter 3 the cadets are told not to worry if some judicial decision ever goes against them. A crook will always get busted again. Supreme Court decisions were often based on libertarian principles. Chapter 4 tells what a new policeman saw on his tour. The old sections of L.A. had narrow streets before automobiles. They were filled with the poor. But no one is so poor that they can't suffer from theft. Chapter 5 takes the reader on tour, and writes about the events. Chapter 6 contrasts the knowledge of an old veteran to the brash presumptions of a rookie.  Chapter 7 tells of an incident with a young perpetrator that almost pushed Serge over the edge. Every action has a reaction. In Chapter 8 Gus learns about a hostile crowd. In Chapter 9 Roy learns about another crowd. In Chapter 10 Serge learns about Hollywood. Chapter 11 tells another story. Roy gets experience on the vice squad (Chapter 12). Serge works plainclothes (Chapter 13). Gus works in vice too (Chapter 14). In Chapter 15 Roy and his partner check out a liquor store, but Roy's inattentiveness or poor judgment brings bad luck. Roy's reassignment may show the need for him to get more experience. Is there a sign he should rejoin the family business?  The remaining chapters finish the book and tell about the three men who were introduced in the first three chapters. The ending surprised me, but it could have been telegraphed by earlier events. The men in this book seem to lack happy home lives, or attend a church regularly. Are other big city police forces like that? I wonder what police in small-towns would say about this book? 
 Few books look at the decline of old ways of life the way "The Magnificent Ambersons" does. Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer-winning novel is a sharp, brilliant, sometimes mocking look at the way that old money crumbled away when the industrial revolution hit, and the way those Gilded Age millionaires ended up. It's undeniably Tarkington's best novel.  Georgie Minafer is the only heir and scion of the wealthy Amberson family, and unsurprisingly he's an insufferable brat. He doesn't improve as he grows up, believing that "there's a few people whose birth and position... puts them at the top" -- and his snottiness doesn't improve when he encounters and falls in love with an inventor's daughter, whose father was once smitten with his mother.  But soon the Amberson fortunes start to change -- family deaths, loss of money, and the encroaching city that is swallowing up their estate. George continues to believe that he is superior to others, but this belief is increasingly strained as "the magnificent Ambersons" lose the last of their property. And George's only salvation may be the man he once called "riffraff."  "The Magnificent Ambersons" seems at first to be a tombstone to the Gilded Age's beauty and glamour. Then you realize that George is a pain in the butt, not a noble figure, and that Tarkington had little affection for that bygone age -- the entire thing is an ironic look at how the "old money" refused to change their ways, and got swamped for it. Tarkington takes aim at rrogance, complacency, idleness and other flaws.  And Tarkington had a rare gift for irony. His writing seems a bit stuffy at first, with pages of details on clothes and parties; but as the Amberson fortunes fall, his prose becomes faster and more incisive. And the differences between idle "old money" and the poeple who "do" things becomes more pronounced, as well as the encroachment of machines and urban life into a once-elegant place. For example, the apartment buildings where the Amberson front lawn was.  It's pretty obvious from the start that while this is George's story, he's not the hero. He's arrogant, pompous, and genuinely believes that he is next to royalty just because his grandfather is rich. Only in the last chapters does he finally realize that he's no better than anyone else -- when even the people who once loathed him no longer even remember him.  The other Ambersons are humbler but no more useful. Aunt Fanny and Uncle George seem almost bewildered by their gradual downslide. And as a contrast to the formerly moneyed family, Tarkington provides readers with the car manufacturer Eugene Morgan -- George's opposite in every way -- and his sprightly, intelligent daughter.  Even the title of "The Magnificent Ambersons" is ironic, and it suits this quietly biting novel about how the world changed at the start of the twentieth century. The best book Tarkington ever wrote 
 I love this book.  I am a Registered Aromatherapist who prepares blends for physical, mental, and emotional well being.  The author writes with such detail that the oils become alive with their own personalities.  The beginning is a brief explanation of Aromatherapy, Oriental medicine and Astrology.  This is followed by a wonderful Materia Medica with explanations of 37 oils.  Each oil is described in two pages which include a brief botanical description, ancient uses, oriental uses of a physical, emotional and spiritual nature, and an astrological description.  He gives suggestions for oils along with detailed explanations for nervous tension, overthinking and worry, anxiety and apprehension, poor concentration and memory, lack of confidence and self-esteem, anger and frustration, disempowerment and indecision, depression and negativity, and problems in relating.  I refer to this book often 
 I watched this movie because I am becoming a fan of the strikingly handsome Vicent Perez. I not only tremendously enjoyed Vicent Perez in this movie but I actually enjoyed the story it told.  Being an American with an hispanic background and a history buff, I often wondered what Spain's role was in the World Wars.  This little story not only let me see a little of what my ancestors stance might have been during this period, but by the way the Spanish people where portrayed in this movie I also caught an insight on their way of life and made me proud of the scence of pride, strength, and intelligence they seemed to have possesed and passed on to future generations.  The chemistry between Vicent Perez and Polly Walker had a little to be desired though.  I am sure this could have been improved if the charactors had been able to explore each other a little more instead of trying to cram their story into 1 dance and one afternoon.  All in all the story was meaningful, enjoyable and encompusses the whole families views and emotions during these trying times 
 I am hoping as much to address the writer as to counsel the reader.  To the reader I would say that this is a very reader-friendly translation.  I like the fact that some modern expressions and idioms are used when it clarifies the text.  If you are fascinated about the early church,  or simply ancient history,  these writings are full of issues which will stimulate thought.  To the writer,  Mr. Trigg, I would ask that future volumes (for I assume you are still writing and translating) include a more extensive index for readers like me who would like to explore Origen by topic.  The index to biblical verses,  which is 12 pages long, and which you painstakingly prepared, is extensive and well done.  But the topic and name index of just 6 pages is too short.  If one wants to search for Origen's teachings on a particular topic,  it could be easier.  I would also say this.  You keep yourself in the background of this book,  I am sure out of modesty.  But I'd like to know  where you found these texts.  Are you working from the original texts or from copies.  What condition are the original texts after over 1700 years.  How did they come to be spread across Europe.  How are they preserved?  Were you permitted to photocopy the texts to translate them back in the U.S. or did you have to work there.  You mention that much of Origen's writings were lost,  but that much remains to be translated.  How much is there?  What are we missing?  Finally,  I would ask the question, "Was Origen a Moral, Vituous Man?"  What can we learn from his life?  What is the lesson of his self-castration?  What is the lesson of the austerity of his lifestyle?  He addresses Gregory as "his son."  Did he literally adopt him,  was he merely a favored student,  or did Origen not fully castrate himself?  Were the rifts he caused among the early Christian churches the result of pridefulness or spite,  or was he the innocent victim of jealous peers.  I have this feeling that Origen will be "re-discovered" someday soon and ordinary people (Christians and closet academics) will again want to know about him.  Books like The Da Vinci Code make me believe that there is a thirst for knowledge about the early church that will only become more intense with time (and with release of the movie).  I think we are at the beginning of a great upwelling of interest in this topic,  and I think that your books will help to satisfy that need.  
 Erin and Darcy have been friends since they were kids. They are best friends who do almost everything together. Erin is a jewellery designer who has just landed a job that will make her career. Darcy is an interior designer with a flourishing business.  When a friend asks them to help her gather data for a televison program she's doing on dating from the personals, the girls agree. After all, it would be fun, answereing a few ads, going out on a few dates. A lark.  And then Darcy doesn't come back from one of the dates. Her body is discovered with a dancing shoe on one foot. Erin decides to date the same men as her friend had, hoping she'll find out who the killer is. However, Darcy wasn't the first victim the killer found though a personal ad and, to his way of thinking, she won't be the last, because now he has his sights set on Erin.  It's always been a mystery to me how anyone can believe what they read in these ads. People lie. I mean you could be going out with a serial killer, as Darcy did, or with a rapist, or the very least, probably someone who is stepping out on his wife. Anyway, one thing is guaranteed for sure, if you read this book, you won't be answering any ads from the Sunday paper, or any other paper either. That said, I couldn't put this one down, it's a super thriller 
 I am a professional Christian Counselor.  I work primarily with children and their parents.  I use recommend this book for all divorced parents who wish to make things work between dad's house and mom's house.  It also gives practical, easy helps for parents who do not know how to respond to their children's anger, questions and pain.  I have found it very helpful and many of the families I work with have also 
 I had mixed feeling about this book. Content wise, it's incredible. It's full of real life stories, data, analyses, propositions of many so called market anomalies. However, I really find some of the chapters too long, especially those after chapter 5. The author had copied his style of thesis writing and actually many of his own theses (he's a renowed professor after all) into a book which has a big audience group of investors or traders who want quick fix or certain level of entertainment and personal improvement. In these respects, the "Psychology of Finance by Lars Tvede" and the "Devil take the hindmost by Edward Chancellor" are "easier" but not definitely better alternatives.   Anway, this is one of the very few "serious" books about behavioural finance that is relatively practical. If you are abound of time, go for it. Otherwise, you may try the two books I mentioned above.  p.s. I like the following the most: In April 1997 Financial Times ran a contest suggested by economist Richard Thaler. Readers were told to choose a whole number between 0 and 100. The winning entry would be the one closest to two thirds of the average entry. The winning choice is 13. The real point of this game is that playing sensibly requires you to have a sense of the magnitude of the other players' errors. Hope you got it right 
 I doubt if most kids would like this bar, but health food fanatics will love it. Subtle flavor mixed with chocolate. Bar is very filling. Dry, use with water 
 I have really enjoyed this CD by Glenn Frey.  All the songs are easy to listen to and I especially like the two that were part of the Miami Vice TV show.  It is a definite addition to any CD collection 
 They're well made, excellent sounding interconnects from a well known audiophile company --I own some of their more upscale/esoteric audio and video cables.  I purchased the 20 ft. run for connecting my DVD player to my Labtec Pulse 475 speaker sys. used with my laptop.  This enables me to play DVD audio or music CDs whether or not my laptop is on.  Please keep in mind that even though these wires were meant to channel a source signal from the mini plug to the RCA connectors and ultimately to your receiver (yep, the arrows near the RCA plugs is showing the intended direction of signal flow) one can use them in a way such that the signal is forced to flow in the opposite direction instead but consistently so, as I have. The penalty is small, and it disappears after the burn-in period, 3-4 mos.  Similarly, I've used their 2 meter Interlink 400 MK II version of this cable to connect my portable CD player to my Klipsch ProMedia 5.1 speakers used with my home workstation with outstanding results!  The only caveat:  in order to fully benefit from cable at this level (quality), all links in the audio chain must, at least, equal the cable's quality since the cable itself IS an audio component or device; otherwise, one may never hear a difference.  The chain is as good as its weekest link.  Benefits:  natural midrange, soundstaging and image details are believable, and bass has nice slam 
 I have an older edition of this book that was given to me, so maybe it's not the same with the new edition, but the times for the recipes are so far off.  Almost every recipe I have tried from this book (other than bread maker recipes or just the basic ideas for food) I have had to cook AT LEAST twice as long as it says.  My babies have all enjoyed the teething biscuits and everything we've made out of the book.  As far as the recipes not being "healthy" enough, I think we all know that making food at home is healthier than processed prepackaged food and I didn't find the recipes to be truly unhealthy.  In my edition of the book she warns off feeding uncooked honey to babies under 1 year and does suggest hot dogs sparingly.  It's not for people who want to go completely "whole foods" but for your average household I think it's a pretty realistic approach to feeding your child.  It would get 5 stars if the recipes were actually the proper cooking time 
 One of the very few stipulations my wife made after we learned we were going to have a child is that I read this book by the doyenne of natural childbirth in the U.S. While the tone of the book is much too touchy-feely/hippyish for me, I have to admit that it is well worth reading regardless of whether you're planning a natural childbirth or a fully tech'ed out hospital one. That said, it would be very easy to read it as gospel and get swept up in its giddy repudiation of modern medicine, so one should approach it with, if not a skeptical eye, at least with one's critical faculties fully engaged. There is also the potential that readers who are fully committed to a hospital birth may come away from this book feeling scolded, or as if their decision is somehow  "wrong".  The author is a superstar in the field of natural childbirth, largely as a result of her 35+ years work at "The Farm", a kind of birthing commune in Tennessee. The first half of the book is a compilation of natural childbirth stories written by mothers who've either done it at The Farm, or somehow in conjunction with the author. While these are certainly useful as illustrative examples of how it all goes down, they tend to get rather repetitive and could certainly stand to be scaled back a bit. And for those who know little about the birthing process, some of the terminology can be unclear. Finally, for those who might want to read this book on the subway (like me), be forewarned that there are some pretty graphic photos of childbirthing in this section.  The second half of the book walks the reader through the entire process, mostly with the aim of explaining why modern medical childbirthing procedures are not based on the mother's health and needs, but are designed for convenience of the medical establishment. Stuff like epidurals, amnios, fetal monitoring, pitocin, forceps, vacuum extractors, etc. all come under sustained assault. Gaskin makes a convincing case for most of her criticism, with plenty of good examples from historical texts and anthropological research. Perhaps the most striking and compelling examples come from studies of childbirthing in modern Scandinavia. Sometimes Gaskin stretches a little to far in her attempt to debunk every single medical procedure and doesn't always have the most current data. For example, Rhogham does not have any mercury whatsoever any more, and the danger from amniocentesis is vastly overstated. However, simply in terms of the debate over natural childbirth vs. hospital birth, it's awfully hard to argue with the data she's gathered from thousands of natural childbirths.  Ultimately the reality is that every mother's experience is different, and there's no technique, approach, or solution that works for everyone. That said, the book did a pretty good job of convincing me that the mother's mental approach to childbirthing and expectations for the experience are the single most important indicator of how it will all go 
 potential buyers: ok, this session is really awesome, but the 1990 remastering does not really help. (let us) hope for a new edition of this session.. 
 I haven't heard them on the radio. (++) Hip UK band with a good mix of talent being shown on the CD. (5*)  The Subways rock hard from start to finish, and they're live shows are astounding.  It's no surprise that the singer needs to temper singing before he explodes.  The bassist also at 110%, loaded with teenage energy.  A talented bunch of kids, the drummer gets me going with his hopping beats.  Everybody loves their energy but I'm soaring on the winds of She Sun, Somewhere, and Lines of Light every day.

 In Britain, retired civil servants are typified by life in rural cottages, pottering about in a rose garden and Sundays with The Times.  Tim Cranmer doesn't quite fulfill the picture.  His "rural cottage" is an inherited spot of land containing a chapel.  His rose garden is a struggling vineyard.  And Sundays are occupied by visits from his former protege.  Instead of a demure wife to complete the picture, Tim's resident lady is half his age and a composer.  Hardly the picture of a staid bureaucrat out to pasture.  Perhaps all these variations are due to Cranmer being other than a "retired civil servant" - he's a retired spook.    Spies never truly retire.  They may distance themselves somewhat from the sharp end, but there are always loose ends left over and old cases that resurrect themselves.  The dissolution of the Soviet Union was supposed to put ranks of spies from the West [and John Le Carre] out of work.  They were considered poorly adapted to the new conditions.  Le Carre and his literary creations have refuted that notion.  His "retired" spy becomes enmeshed in a conspiracy of stupendous scope.  It seems his protege, who was a double pretending to spy for the Soviets, is involved in an embezzlement - 37 billion BP, to be exact.  The money is to finance a war of "national liberation" - a little item of ethnic minorities having faith in their identity.  Their location is in the ramparts of the Caucasus Mountains, where loyalties are fierce, but the population scattered.  Lacking resources, they seem to have convinced Cranmer's double to help finance weapons' purchases.  Larry Pettifer, Cranmer's long-term protege, is an intellectual.  He changes ideologies like his socks.  A consummate wheeler-dealer, he duped his Soviet minders for many years.  What effect did his most recent case officer have to change him?  And where does Tim's resident consort, who disappears mysteriously, fit in to the picture?  Emma finds Larry charming, but his flighty personality and behaviour seem inconsistent for a woman yearning for stability.  Has she fled from security to embrace adventure?  What price will Tim pay to recover her?  The Western powers seek stability as well.  Le Carre imparts the view that once the Soviet Empire dissolved, capitalism sought but fresh opportunities for investment.  Justice and enterprise are often at odds, the more so when resources like oil or minerals are involved.  Le Carre has taken up the cause of justice in all his writings, but his more recent ones speak with a more strident voice.  Cranmer is portrayed as a voice of an older generation, quietly pleased that the Soviet Union is moribund.  The issues of the post-Soviet East seem remote.  Le Carre, with his usual skill, portrays a man drawn in by events beyond his control or his ken.  It is easy to sympathise with him.  But it is Pettifer's idealism that speaks for Le Carre.  Never an ideologue, Le Carre's finely wrought narrative confronts us with our own uncaring self-interest.  Capitalism may have triumphed, but the victory isn't without flaws.  An excellent read and a tribute to Le Carre's skills in plot and characterisation.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada 
 The author gives an in depth incisive analysis that shows in great detail how culture truly affects a societies prosperity. The western countries largely had firm beliefs in progress, private property, freedom, a work ethic, tenacity, thrift, and competition. These traits led to Europe's unprecedented innovations and technological advancements. Japan and Hong Kong are prime examples of non-European countries that have had fantastic success by adopting western style Capitalism. In my opinion their strong sense of family was just as crucial. His conclusion that until these traits are adopted by all nations, the CHASM between the rich and poor nations will continue to grow. His thesis proved logical enough for this skeptical reader to agree with him. 
 James Newton Howard, composer of the scores to films like Treasure Planet, Peter Pan, Atlantis, Dinosaur and of course The Fugitive wins again with the score to Hidalgo.  In a movie full of diverse situations and peoples, Howard manages to create an interesting and beautiful score that encompasses all aspects of the films.  He is not a grand scope composer like Williams, but Howard is able to capture perfectly the feel of a film and like his score for Peter Pan, write some great music.  I highly recommend it 
 It's amazing how many people have read this classic Peters and Waterman book. It's even more amazing then how most companies have simply ignored the lessons illustrated within, only to continue on their dismal path of mediocrity. The basic lesson to be learned is that if your company religiously follows the core tenets outlined in the book, then your company will be the leader in your industry, because you will be the only company to do so. So why is this circa 1980's book still relevant? Because the principles apply just as much today, and they apply equally well to business of any nature. If you read this book, absorb all of the lessons, and practice them in your daily activities, then you will have learned the most important lesson in your business life 
 Wonderful resource for the amp mechanic.  A great first book with all of the basics.  Great insights from a very experienced amp tech 
 Informative text The illustrations enhance the appeal of the book. Very useful when presetning to groups of students 
 I greatly dislike and resent reviewers who give away plots and endings.  Why do they do it?  This is one of my all-time favorite musicals.  It is not a flag-waver and it does not sugar-coat war (rah-rah-America!), though as one reviewer mentioned, there is a note at the ending saying that war bonds would be sold in the lobby.  War is hell.  Everyone in it was wonderful, Garland actually kept right up with Kelly in the dancing, and she came across strong, professional and abundantly talented, all of which she is.  (Incidentally, before Pal Joey, there was a straight play by Saroyan called The Time of Your Life which I think was Kelly's first big break (he danced), and before that a part in the chorus of a Porter musical called Leave It To Me, more than that I don't know.)  The movie is singing and dancing from stem to stern, all wonderful, all Garland and/or Kelly, and I loved every minute of it. The directing was also good, though I'm no judge of that kind of thing, but it struck me as inventive and original while I watched it. I totally abhored Murphy's bit in France when he makes a sap out of the poor dumb foreigner with the fake money.  And then his men have a good laugh.  I thought it stunk.  And on the subject of George Murphy (whose career in movies was about as stellar as Ronald Reagan's), Tom Lehrer said (sang, actually), "Gee it's great!  At last we've got a senator who can really sing and dance!"  That's about the size of it, folks.  And I didn't think he did either of those particularly well.  If he'd gotten the girl, I wouldn't have watched the movie a second time.  One last note.  I cried during this movie when Danny left for duty.  And I really cried at the end 
 This book is excellent for just carrying around as a field guide, probably one of the best there is. Good artwork and descriptions, kept short and simple, with all general identification features included. Large list of native trees with some exotic species as well, it doesn't leave any important ones out 
 Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book.  I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender.  I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side.  The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie.  In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen.  As an aside, I remain amazed and impressed that Iles can so effectively write a  novel in the first person in which the character speaking is a female sufferring from the effects of  sexual abuse.   Not a five star, but a solid four.   
 This DVD is beautiful. The high quality slow-zoom slideshow with the inspiring commentary of the artist was absolutely captivating.   Highly recommended 
 If you're ready for the bizzare, look no farther than this book. It is as bizzare as any form of Ripley's has ever been. The tv, the books, the museums, it's all as strange. 
 This movie is very worth seeing for the story and the performances.   Charlize Theron is one of our greatest actresses performing today.   Recommended highly....actually this is probably a 4.5 movie.  You'll like it! Email:boland7214@aol 
 I see a lot of negative reviews for this album and I just don't know why.  25 To Life is worthy of at least 4 stars.  Now I admit I was a little disappointed in the album but that's only because I had very high expectations for it.  With P$C being T.I.'s crew (right now he's the King Of The South...whether you like it or not!) and them dropping nothing but heaters from In Da Streetz Vol. 1-4 and P$C getting down on all three of T.I.'s album I just expected a classic album.  Although 25 To Life is not a classic album it is still a good album nonetheless.    P$C consists of Big Kuntry King, AK, MacBoney, CRod, and T.I.  Other than TIP, Big Kuntry King and MacBoney are the best members.  MacBoney definitely delivers on the album as he rips into almost every track he is on.  Big Kuntry King did disappoint a little bit though.  He doesn't have the same swagger and cockiness here that he had on his own mixtape My Turn To Eat.  That's the part where the album kinda lets up.  Its supposed to be The Big Three carrying the weight but with Kuntry King punching the clock you only have two to carry the torch.  Nonetheless the production on the album is that fie fie delish and guests CeeLo, Lloyd, and Young Dro all add something to each of the songs they are featured on.  As a matter of fact the collaboration with Cee-Lo WALK THIS WAY could possibly be the best song of 2005.  If not the best then top 5 at the least!  The song is just so smooth and soothing and T.I. & MacBoney straight up rip the song to shreds;  CeeLo also puts his all into the chorus and the beat is just straight up Pimp playa riding.  My favorite songs on the album are Lookin Shife, Westside, F Where You From, Do Ya Thing, Im A King, Walk This Way, Coming Down, Mess It Up, Murder Game, and Set It Out (Kuntry King shows flashes of his potential here).  P$C drops a very good album with 25 To Life.  If you like T.I. you will like this album.  P$C is much better than other buddy groups such as D12, The Old DTP (without Field Mob & Bobby Valentino), St. Lunatics, etc. Go ahead and drop them dollas on this album, it won't disappoint 
 or to at least give up the rights to Nickelodeon or some company with competent marketing staff who'll give proper treatment to this classic television sitcom.  It says more about the quality of Fox marketing staff than about Mary Tyler Moore that the first four seasons apparently were not big sellers. They did not effectively promote them (from the poorly designed covers to the almost total lack of extras). The MTM show is considered one of the top TV comedies of all time and has the number one ranked episode of all time in a TV Guide poll ("Chuckles Bites the Dust") in Season 6.  The MTM show is so enmeshed in culture that the theme song is in use in two commercials right now and the cast got a standing ovation at last year's Emmy Awards. But the Fox marketing "experts" dump the nearly bare bones first four seasons onto DVD with no promotion and then apparently kill the last three seasons because of "poor sales."  The quality of the actual video is very decent at least. The first four seasons are well worth buying here on Amazon. But people have been expecting some participation from Ms. Moore and other cast members, I think. There are also obviously people out there who will also wait and buy the whole set when it's released collectively.  Consider writing the editors of DVD review sites (there are many) and urge a petition to get Fox to relent and release the last three seasons or at least give up the rights to Nickelodeon or someone who knows how to do DVD correctly. Show some respect, Fox 
 this music is so vacuous it almost breaks you heart, but it sounds so F-ing good. "baby I dont care" is one of the most nihilistic bubble gum songs of the 1980's 
 This is another good story in the line of alphabet mysteries by Sue Grafton. Her few "detours" from great writing in previous "letters" seem to have been a minor bump in the road and she now returns to a good plot and strong characters.  I have to admit that one of my favorite characters in this series is Henry Pitt, Kinsey Millhone's landlord and friend. I enjoyed the Henry who wrote crossword puzzles and tried them out on Kinsey before he sent them in for publication. I enjoyed the Henry who always had something baking in his kitchen. And many times I have wondered why some sexy senior citizen hasn't snagged this wonderful catch of a man!  This story gives us a little more insight into Henry than we've seen in the past. Henry convinces Kinsey to help a friend of his on a simple matter - she needs to show that Henry's friend served in the military during World War II so he can be buried as a veteran. Such a simple request and it should have a simple solution, but as we've seen with Kinsey in the past, nothing is an easy task, so the plot thickens...   The family of the deceased is too busy fighting among themselves to be much help to Kinsey. Then an old friend shows up and gets attacked at the dead guy's apartment.  Once again we're on a race to see what's around the next corner for Kinsey and to find out why the government has no record of this veteran serving his country.   There's a little bit of mystery, but more suspense in this book. And more laughs than we've seen in the past with Grafton's other books. I'd recommend this easy read to anyone wanting a few hours of enjoyment as it's definitely one of Sue Grafton's better books in this series. I only hope she will continue with this quality and not hit any more bumps that throw her off to only mediocre writing!

 The book "Astrology, Psychology and the Four Elements" by Stephen Arroyo is an interesting viewpoint of astrology that emphasizes an individual's psychological make-up from an astrological perspective.  Published in 1975, Mr. Arroyo divided the book into two parts.  The first part he entitled "Astrology & Psychology", which contains eight chapters.  The second part he entitled "The Four Elements: An Energy Approach to Interpreting Birth Charts", which also contains eight chapters (numbered from nine to sixteen).  What differentiates this book from other typical astrology books is that it is not merely a look-up table for trying to interpret a person's birth chart.  In the first part, Mr. Arroyo compares the works of various psychologists (such C. G. Jung, Sigmund Freud and O. Hobart Mowrer), physicians (such as Alexander Ruperti), philosophers (such as L. L. White, Hans Stossel, Irving F. Laucks and Pascal), biologists (such as Père Tielhard de Chardin) and writers (such as Goethe) with various astrologers (such as Dane Rudhyar, David Hamblin and Marc E. Jones), mythological experts (such as Joseph Campbell) and people claiming clairvoyant abilities (such as Edgar Cayce).  From these (and many others whom I have not named), Mr. Arroyo creates a synthesis to describe a more humanistic and holistic approach to both psychology and astrology, and encourages psychological counselors interested in astrology to utilize tools from astrology to assist in understand their patients.  He also lays the foundation for viewing the zodiacal signs with regard to the seasons of the year in which they fall with their corresponding psychological meanings.  In the second part, Mr. Arroyo describes various astrological components, such as the signs of the zodiac (from a more elemental perspective), the planets (from an "energy regulator" perspective) and the houses.  He emphasizes that a simple mechanistic approach of chart interpretation often falls short when the impact of the elements themselves are not fully taken into account, as well as not taking into account how particular individuals may make decisions that overcome what might otherwise may be misinterpreted as "difficult" aspects, when they might actually be good.  His descriptions of the elements were well thought out, as were his discussions of elemental imbalances.  In the final two chapters, he touches briefly on chart comparisons between people and the houses.  Overall, I found "Astrology, Psychology and the Four Elements" to be a very interesting read.  I rate the book with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning some basics about astrology 
 Unlike "Small Island," this book sticks to big cities that are familiar to travelers.  Alternating the present trip with a years-ago trip with Katz makes this more interesting.  He has his rants and he sometimes whines, but he is always funny and the narrative moves right along.  This is not a travel guide but a series of essays.  
 James "D-Train" Williams was one of the 1980s very best male R&B singers yet he never really received the acclaim and recognition due him. This CD has most of the big hits from 1981-85 but it should have included the ORIGINAL version of "You're The One For Me" (not the 1985 remix!).This CD is nonetheless a great compilation and is indispensable for any 1980s urban R&B fan 
 This dvd is mostly just stretching but its very relaxing.  Her voice is calming and gentle but a little strange, takes some getting use to.  It kinda freaks me out for the first few minutes every time I put it in!  This is the dvd I like to use before I go to my yoga class for some reason.  I guess because of all the stretching it really loosens ya up. She uses different poses than most other dvds which is nice for a change. A great one to have in your library. Beautiful scenery also 
 If you love hardbop and/or Horace Silver and/or Art Blakey, you need this album.  It is just a joy to hear the band setting the course that so many others would follow over the years 
 Generally I don't read business books, but I picked The Rebel Rules up at the suggestion of a friend. I'm glad I did. I was so energized by the author's clear and palpable passion for his business and for life. Conley's focus on creativity, innovation and the esprit de corps of his employees was refreshing. Although I am in education and not business, I was struck by how many of his ideas could easily translate to the classroom. I highly recommend this book to those both in business and in other fields 
 There is a lot of information on the newer lilies,but I was disappointed there weren't more pictures of the lilies 
  Ah, The Blues Brother! A Cult Classic that tops the list! Our son owns a much viewed (and enjoyed) VHS tape of the Blues Brothers. One we have borrowed many times. When we saw this DVD and noted that it was a Collector's Edition, we knew we had to add it to our own DVD collection. Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were destined to star in this movie. Jake and Elwood are an 'Unholy Pair' on a 'Mission From God'. There will never be anyone like the Blues Brothers, again. Too cool for words! They speak in Jack Webb/Henry Morgan 'Dragnet' style, clipped and dour. They want 'action' and along the way they not only get it, they give it! You'll be in for one toe tappin', finger snappin', racin', chasin', shoot 'em up, bang 'em up, hell's a poppin' time! Enjoy the ride! ~ Mrs. B 
 What a breath of fresh air!  I loved reading this book!  It brings sanity to the insanity.  I love reading this because it makes me feel like I was not alone in all the craziness of being pregnant and a new mom.  I appreciate her realness!!!!!  Thanks Jenny for such a great book 
 This is an adorable love movie for anyone. It's witty humor and charming story combine into making it the perfect romantic-comedy! It's great for watching any time, or even when you're feeling blue!  It's sure to lift the spirits!!! 
 With characteristic wit, intellect and open-mindedness, Robert McNeil and William Cran explore the protean version of English used in America. Though they give ample time to the prescriptivist side of the argument (the side concerned with enforcing rules and determining standards of proper usage), they are clearly more in the descriptivist camp, fascinated by the way the language is actually used.  The times are on their side. Informal language, once kept out of dictionaries and standards guides by the educated elite, is rushing into normal use at breakneck speed. These days, a word is hardly coined before it has been snatched up by major media outlets and put into print. And rushed out of print almost as quickly. Last week, I heard the word "gnarly" used to described a snowstorm. My teenage son was appalled. "When was the last time you heard anyone say 'gnarly'?" he asked incredulously. Mind you, this word is all of 10 years old, and it is already considered passé.  McNeil and Cran describe the way American language standards are affected by the media, social trends, technology, the tastes of elites, regional accents, racial history and even civic pride. Yet they claim that accent leveling --the homogenizing of regional speech patterns -- is largely a myth. In spite of the disappearance of certain isolated regional accents and vocabulary -- like those of Down East Maine -- some accents are actually growing in strength. Pittsbughers, for instance, are consciously proud of their distinctive pronunciations, a fact that keeps them (the pronunciations) alive. Too, most people (including this writer) don't usually consider themselves to have accents at all. Our own speech is "normal"; it's those other folks who have accents!  Those wishing to build predictable, enduring rules for American English are bound to dislike this book. McNeil and Cran even demolish the idea that these rules have even been around for a long time. Many were decided, after long years of variation, in the last few decades by a single influential writer. The idea of taming the use of English, when it is being twisted and molded into new shapes almost daily, seems a fool's errand. Long-fought causes now seem lost -- restricting "hopefully" to mean "It is hoped that" rather than the more common, "filled with hope"; using "impact" only as a noun; using "indices" (rather than "indexes") as the plural of "index"; the unstoppable American habit of splitting infinitives. Yet McNeil and Cran urge us not to despair. We are witnessing not the degeneration of English, but its continual evolution. Though I personally would like to see people distinguish "ensure" (to make certain) from "insure" (to protect oneself with an insurance policy) such decisions are not in my hands 
 This series has always been something of a guilty pleasure for me.  Yes, there's still Roark, but he is less involved with the case than he once was.  I love the cast of characters, the crisp, witty dialogue, and Eve's constant battle with her cars and the chocolate thief.  But there were also scenes that brought tears to my eyes and others that made me catch my breath in suspense.  The books in this series are always good reads 
 I enjoyed this book very much.  It is an interesting and accessible discussion of the biological impact of invasive species.  More than strictly a scientific book, this book discusses the incredible diversity of life forms and how they can thrive and survive in the most harsh environments, including outer space.  A very pleasant read 
 Great looking and quite large. Easy to see from a distance, though the other two dials are correspondingly small. Updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate. I wish that I had a dozen of them. The price is very reasonable also. I certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually. 
 The 100 2-sided CD/DVD sleeves were a great buy.  They are fairly durable and make carrying/storing CDs/DVDs easier 
 Some people have criticized this book, saying Kurosawa does not go deep enough into his films, particularly his later ones, and why he did what he did. In all honesty, maybe the popularity over this book is poorly done - all the reviews on the front and back cover talk about it like Kurosawa will explain his movies in detail, and most often advertisements will talk about how if you like his movies you should read the book. But as Kurosawa himself says in the preface, he did it really out of encouragement from friends and in an effort perhaps to do what Jean Renoir did do and John Ford did not. As the title suggests, it is really a more personal, casual, reflection upon his life from his birth to the filming of "Rashomon," his first international success, in 1950. In a way, the personal route may be a humbling experience to the film guru or the Kurosawa fanatic. Too often directors or filmmakers are treated - as many artists are, in fact - more like a synopsis of their latest work. We constantly hear about how masterful Stanley Kubrick was and what his methods were, but who was he really? What school did he go to? Who were his friends? His teachers? What was his family like? What were his boyhood passions? Who is this man behind the camera?  Kurosawa tells us that in his story from his first memories as a child ("I was in a washtub naked," page 3) through his school years and through a tough young adulthood. It is all very well written, and actually quite interesting, particularly the segments on Mr. Tachikawa, who we can probably thank for Kurosawa's love of painting, his brother forcing him to face his fears, (not only of water, but of death as well) and two daring but stupid moments in a mountain village where he almost killed himself to impress the local children.  Kurosawa's growth is nearly coincidental with Japanese history. Just as Japan was constantly changing through out the 20th century, so to was Kurosawa. Forced to participate in a military program at his school, he takes every opportunity to belittle or make a fool of his army captain. His venture into art is like an odd adventure, going from joining a socialist art movement (nearly being captured by the Japanese secret police!) to living on his own to writing scripts and eventually joining Photo Chemical Laboratory. (later Toho Studios) He discusses marrying an actress because he was afraid of never being married before the "Honorable Death of the Hundred Million" many Japanese believed they would commit if invasion seemed immenant. This eventually goes on to his work as an Assistant Director, and later making his very own films through Toho and later Daiei after the Toho Studio strikes. These parts will be more to the liking of the film guru, as Kurosawa does give backstory to the inspirations behind his early work.  During this time period he speaks a lot of his family and the friends he got to know. His brother is such a remarkable and likeable character that when he commits suicide you really do feel sad. I took a particular love for Kurosawa's father: although some may see him as a bit harsh when he berates his wife for placing fish wrong or getting upset with his son for failing courses, one shouldn't dismiss him with the simple western stereotype of the tough father for he does have a heart. When Kurosawa's wife becomes pregnant and he pays a visit to his family, his father gives him a large bag of rice and says it is for his pregnant wife, not wanting her to go hungry in a time when food was scarce in Japan.  Perhaps, in the end, it is really fitting that Kurosawa focus so much on his personal feelings rather than his film. If you have watched his films and studied them, you will see the influences from his past life in those very films. "Something Like an Autobiography" was written long before Kurosawa made "Dreams," yet I found myself recalling the film reading this book. Besides his references to mountain climbing, he also talks about how in his father's village children would place flowers over a rock, and he learned that long ago a warrior had been killed and the villagers buried him there out of pity and placed the rock over his grave, so now children place flowers on it whenever they pass out of respect. Sound familiar? I also smiled at the section near the end when he discusses a Daiei studio executive - one who had been so steadfastly against making "Rashomon" - coming on TV and speaking for the film as if he was the mastermind behind it. I was thinking of the Deputy Mayor in "Ikiru," who is against the park project from the beginning yet after Watanabe's death takes all the credit. Maybe Kurosawa alludes to this kind of art reflecting life on page 163 when he mentions the oddly impeccable timing of "The Cuckoo Waltz" while dubbing "Drunken Angel."  This is a recommended read for any one interested in film or Akira Kurosawa's life - it is easy to read, full of wisdom, and is very frank and personal. As I said, it's not a 198 page thesis on his films, but as Kurosawa says in the book he does not enjoy explaining his films - he puts into his films what he has to say and leaves it at that. As the last line of the book says, "There is nothing that says more about its creator than the work itself. 
 SAINT RALPH is the perfect movie to have on hand for entertaining houseguests or cheering someone up, since most folks haven't already seen it, it's uplifting, and it has wide appeal (sports, coming-of-age, dramatic storyline, funny).  Much of this movie's humor is that of misunderstanding.  Ralph, a 9th grader, gets a lot wrong, perhaps since he has so little guidance, with his war hero father dead, his hospitalized Mom entering a coma, and living unsupervised at home by faking to the Headmaster that he's staying with grandparents.  Plus, he's got more typical 14-year-old problems, as he's the object of ridicule by classmates and can't control his hormones.  After a little pool incident, the Headmaster attempts to resolve Ralph's horny "energy surplus" problem by sentencing him to the cross-country team.  After his coach says, "let's go, 180 days left til the Boston Marathon," Ralph asks about running it, and the coach says he was kidding, that anyone from the team winning it would be "a miracle to rival the loaves and fishes."  Having taken literally a nurses statement that it'd take a miracle for his mom to recover, scrawny, smoker Ralph then sets out to win the Boston miracle, in defiance of opposition from the Headmaster.  Ralph gets misguided (and comedic) instruction from out-of-date books about how to train and from a fellow student (and aspiring nun/crush-interest) on the requirements for producing a miracle.  Despite the Catholic setting, this is not a religious movie, and secularists could easily point out that Ralph's theology is all confused and the movie's about hard work and good intentions, while a believers might see it as picturing God's responsiveness to sincere, crying hearts, even if our theology's not all formulated rightly.  Artistically, the movie is wonderful as well, the acting impeccable and music fitting.  Ebert & Roeper were right in applying what's usually a cliche, "beautiful gem."  Won awards from Toronto, Palm Springs, and Seatle.  (Brief poolhouse backside nudity, some taking of Lord's name in vain.  Neither gratuitous. 
 This book is great for the person who would like to know more about bigfoot.  It is broken down into sections where it describes certain aspects of what bigfoot is like, and why he is next to impossible to see.  It almost gives you a feeling of what bigfoots thought process might be.  It then gives a chronological description of encounters with bigfoot throughout recorded history.  I would defintely recommend this book 
 When I was a kid in the late 60's and early 70's, I read all eight books in the J.R. Tunis series in his Dodgers series.  Anyone who gets into the series MUST start with this one.    Roy Tucker is an integral part in  nearly all the books ("Young Razzle" being the exception), and  "The Kid From Tomkinsville" introduces him along with the other  characters.    While some of the dialogue is of the "gee whiz"  variety, the book and series are excellent.  I'm so glad they were  re-released, and I now have all of them.    Now, I want to get a Dodgers  replica jersey with the name "Tucker" above the number 34.  Any  kid between 9 and 90 who reads this book will know why 
 Many people would be more interested in Zarathustra but I bought if for Heldenleben. I heard it on a streaming radio station and it was spectacular. The sound quality is amazing not to mention the performance.   I recommend it to anyone who likes R. Strauss as I do (my favorite classical composer) 
 What originally turned my attension towards Sarah McLachlan was her terrific song "Building a Mystery" which opens the the "Lilith Fair" 1997 DVD concert. I bought the DVD because of the contributions from Sheryl Crow and Indigo Girls. I then discovered that Sarah was a singer and an artist that could not be ignored. Her performances there are simply outstanding. Her great songs, her unforgettable voice and charm; convinced me.  "Solace" was her second album; first released in 1991. There are some very fine songs here; especially in the first half on the CD; the CD loses a little steam towards the end.  My favourite track is "The Path of Thorns", but other songs like "Drawn to the Rhytm", "Into the Fire" and "Lost" are just as strong as most of her later recordings 
 I wish I'd had this book when my first marriage ran into trouble.  My counselor at that time told me the marriage could be saved only if both persons were willing to work on it and that one person could not save it alone.   The focus of this book is on developing fresh perspectives about the relationship, overcoming resentment, recapturing lost intimacy and solving major problems, one at a time.  Don't give up without first trying these techniques 
 A wonderful story about a family escaping slavery using astronomy and song. Beautifully illustrated 
 If you ever wondered what the down side of the twenties were read this. The excess was all a grand show, an escape from post war realities. A whole generation seemed to refuse to grow up, at least for awhile. Maturity was forced upon Scott and in these short confessions he reveals that all was not well in paradise. He lived in a haze of liquor, that was the dream preserving liquid illusion.  But reality was not to be fought off forever. This is as close to a biography as we have from Scott, and it is moving in the way it is moving to see an athlete we all wanted to believe would live forever come to his day of retirement. He had the ability or charisma compounded by artistic talent to embody not just his but a whole societies dreams. But his moment passed and by the time Scott wrote this his books were no longer the rage. What makes him such a tragic figure is that he never altogether let go of those first illusons, never went through a moment where he learned from them and let them go. And one senses just as he had the egotists ability to romanticize his life with his words he also had the ability to perhaps overdramatize his own demise. He was not a person to learn, become made of harder stuff, and continue. Still there is some good stuff in this book. His letters to his daughter( who also wished to become a writer) in which he urges her to read great authors including his own favorite Browning are touching and revealing 
 "Communication is key at every stage" the authors sensibly suggest, so I think I'll sound Marjorie out rather than simply giving her the book out-of-the-blue. It's a marvelous guide, either for those experienced in the joys of S&M like myself or beginners like I hope my wife will be. Practical tips are given matters such as toys and techniques, and guidance is even given for building and equipping your own dungeon. We might even explore that possibility when Jonathan's departure for college in October frees up a bedroom. All in all a fantastic guide 
 In this album Photek has shown that there is no limit for finding new ways to produce an experimental drum and bass compilation he is always breaking new grounds and is a constant inspiration 
 Usually I don't read huge novels such as this, feeling like every page was worth reading to the end. Of Human Bondage is an excellent novel full of heart, warmth, humor, romance, and depth, with characters that are so refreshing, real, and believable. Maugham eloquently made the style of the third-person omniscient narrator so modern that it was hard for me to believe that this book was published in 1915. I have to admit though that the only thing that kept me reading was the unique relationship between Philip and Mildred. At times the story was slow, and some chapters seemed more like filler, but still, this book was worth reading and I was impressed at the end. Definitely a classic. 
 Thirty years ago Tom Hopkins was a real estate "sales guru" who gave me a tape system at a one-day seminar in Montgomery County, Maryland. That night I listened to the tapes and the next day did exactly what he said to do...I listed and sold the same house myself in 24 hours!!!  His tapes are basic. You follow them, do the work, and you get paid! 
 I love this nouvelle.  As for the reader from New York below, their review can be summed up as follows,"I wish I could like this masterpiece of French literature, since I am such a fan, but I find it incredibly boring."  Since this doesn't make any sense, I would advise disregarding his/her review 
 I love reading these books aloud (I usually start with Wrinkle in Time and then the kids read the rest on their own because they are "hooked!").  My students groan when I say that I have to stop for the day!  Even though there are sophisticated ideas and words in these stories, the third and fourth graders in my class latch on to the plot and are carried along through the tougher concepts.  Every time I read Wrinkle I find that my students are sitting forward as we wind down towards the end waiting to see if Charles Wallace will be rescued and if the space travelers will return home to Earth safely.  I also love that I am able to share some positive qualities that human beings can seek to have and share with the rest of the world, universe, etc. while reading these "science fiction" novels.  Madeleine L'Engle is one of my favorite writers and I've read most of her books, both literature and those that speak about the spiritual life 
 I use to think Andrew Jackson was such a Great Man and leader of the American People and that the United States Government was the wisest and most powerful government in the world.  That is until I read this book back in the early 1970's.  The way I looked at this country and it's leaders was turned around from then on in my life.  I had already gone through the period where John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King were assassinated right on TV for the whole world to see, in broad daylight.  And then the cover ups!  And the American people bought into the lies, the deceit, that was told to us, hook, line, and sinker.  I had already done research on the Kennedy assassination and knew that it was a cover up. Lone assassin my butt!  So, when I read this book by Dee Brown the flood lights came on.  Watching TV as a little boy the "Red Savages" were always the bad guys and those programs were made to brainwash the American people into believing that lie as well.  And we did.  Until Dee Brown released this book.  The murderous atrocities, stealing their land for gold, rapes of young boys, women and men by United States Soldiers, were all allowed and committed by this white washed United States Government then and now, YES NOW, towards Native Americans should be put on trial and a shakedown of this so called Government "for the people" should be the least we as Americans should do.  But most Americans watch the six o' clock evening news and that is the only gospel they will ever know or believe.  Of course white America made excuses and perpetuated lies to try and discredit Dee Brown and the truth that was told in the pages of this explosive book, over 30 years ago now.  But, after selling 5 million copies and still climbing, it has stood the test of time and it's opposers.  If you never read another book besides this one, as long as you live, this should be the book.  You say, quit complaining and what can be done about it?  I just did, I wrote it down and you just read it and you now know how to find out more by buying this book.   
 Definitely, Season 4 of Columbo is a winner replete with a number of excellent episodes that will provide hours of enjoyment.    "An Exercise in Fatality" with Robert Conrad as an owner of a string of health clubs who murders his partner, and "By Dawn's Early Light," about a military school commandant (Patrick McGoohan) who murders a trustee who wants to convert the military school to a co-ed community college, are clearly the best of the lot. What is fascinating about Columbo is not only the quality of the writing and the pacing of the episodes, but the remarkable cadre of top tier actors that appeared on the show: Jack Cassidy, Robert Vaughn, Dean Stockwell, George Hamilton, John Cassavettes, Oscar Werner, Lesley Ann Warren, Robert Culp, Leslie Nielsen, Janet Leigh, and Gena Rowlands to name a few.   If you buy only one season of Columbo, make it Season 4. Unfortunately, the only extra is another dull and completely unnecessary episode of Ms. Columbo "Caviar with Everything." Still, no interviews or extras clearly leave Columbo fans disappointed with the hope that future boxed sets will have something more enticing to watch--even an episode of the ridiculous "A-Team" would be more welcome than Ms. Columbo.  To address the problems many other Amazon reviewers have been experiencing with their DVD sets, I can say my set works just fine with no malfunctions. I might suggest that keeping your DVDs in their plastic sleeves and refraining from using them as coasters when not in use might help. If that doesn't work, invest in a better DVD player. 
 When I read this book I have got the impression to communicate with a positive friend. M. Maltz offers a very different approach of the problems in the life. If you are neurotic, this book is for you 
 This is a fabulous book for the beginning witch, and one that you can grow with. It contains recipes for all purposes a beginner would want/need, and numerous recipes that I consider intermediate to advanced. (Please note that this consideration is from my viewpoint, and I am a beginner myself.) The section on substitutions by itself makes this book well worth the purchase price. Even though I am a relative beginner, my book is already dog-eared and well-worn from use 
 The late Robin Harris was on his way to superstardom when he died unexpectedly of a heart attack at age 36.  Sadly, very little material exists of this master.  His unique "down home" style paved the way for fellow Chi-Town comic Bernie Mac's eventual breakthrough and success. As the first commercially available DVD on Robin (sadly, his ***** HBO One Night Stand was announced a couple years back but never released)this is definitely a must own.  It is produced by Michael Willams, the founder of The Comedy Act Theater, the South Central nightspot where comedians like Harris, Martin Lawrence, Kym Whitley, Joe Torry and Chris Tucker first gained fame.  Essentially, it consists of a TV pilot filmed independently in 1989 at the CAT that until now, has never been seen.  In between segments featuring Robin (sometimes in drag), Myra J, Lewis Dix, Reynaldo Rey and Cheryl Lee Ralph, are recently shot interviews with Williams and other comedians and friends who knew Robin.  Tiny Lister and John Henton pop up in cameos.  For a casual viewer, the laughs will probably come more from the crazy late 80s wardrobe than actual jokes, but every moment Robin is onstage is magic. If the show had been produced, it would have fit in well next to the syndicated "Uptown Comedy Club" and "Apollo Comedy Hour," or the current "Tom Joyner Show,"  if not "In Living Color."  In a lot of ways, this is also a testament to Mr. Willams, a man who was also ahead of his time.  He recognized the need for an all-black comedy club in LA where comedians could experiment and be themselves.  His accomplishment clearly opened the door for Def Comedy Jam, BET Comicview, The Kings of Comedy Tour, the movies Friday and Topper Carew's Talkin' Dirty After Dark.  There's still plenty of room for a full-length retrospective of Robin Harris' legacy.  However, If you want a rare glimpse of the earliest days of what became a huge cultural phenomenon definitely order this dvd up today 
 I am happy to see this outstanding text in print once again.  This book is a must have for all who are interested in the subject of radiation-hydrodynamics 
 Someone should have pushed this book into the hands of the many leaders of nations around the world, who remain oblivious to the power of nature and of the impact we not only have on it, but the impact it can have on us. The fact that within two years of publishing this book, Winchester's unwitting prophecy that that part of the world would explode once again with immense loss of life and of ability to care for life due to the plate tectonics of that area, is nearly awesome in it's correctness. Yes, there are numerous mistakes and flaws in the book, both scientific and literature related, but of the three books I've read of Winchester's, this book grabbed and held my attention with the sheer writing and momentum. As a deaf person, I always would love to have more pictures, more maps (I enjoy being able to trace the happenings of such an occurrence), but with or without the few graphic media provided, the book draws a moving timeline, and the use of diary and journal entries from those who saw this happening provide us with more than enough information to guage how 'bad' this must have been in comparison to Katrina of 2005, and the tsunami of 2004. The one written statement of pumice stone gathered in knots that ships had to go through that was laced with the leftover debris of Krakatoa including palm trees, plants, animals, and people who are whole but are without clothes on (they had been blasted off of them by the force of the surf most probably) is as good as a photographic journal. I am not into the gruesome, I am into the history.  I also agree with the author's realization that this horrific catastrophe merely provided the exclamation point of political and religious change that was already in the works against the colonial imperialism of that time. The argument of whether the change to a more fanatical form of Islamic faith was an answer to the prayers of the native people of this area, could be a loud and long debate. But the fact of the matter was, that the egotism and paternalism of white man's colonialistic endeavors needed to end. And yet, we still seem to fall into old patterns, thinking that our political and religious answers can 'fit all' continues to resonate; and as long as it does, we will continue to face rebellion from those we push our beliefs on. It is one thing when someone seeks for something different and finds it on their own. It's another thing when Western Civilization waltzes in and states 'this is what's best for you, do what I tell you (and somehow make us a profit that rightfully belongs to your people) and we will babysit you guys!  People of various nations are made up of individuals. Individuals decide for themselves where they want to go, what they want to do with their land. True benevolence means providing assistance needed, then backing off...yet this concept seems to escape the minds of our politicians and militarists.  A wonderful history, that approaches an incident from all directions. A wonderful book, in that it really makes  you stop and think. Hope I find more of his books are like this.  Karen SAdle 
 Excellent resource for Biblical studies, informative and concise. Recommended to congregation by Dr. Gene Scott, pastor of the University Cathedral in Los. Angeles, California 
 I love my new Samsung 225BW ,22in. wide screen monitor.Its so EZ to research and see so nice and bug.I play POGO games and its great.The price is right ,quality awesome,simple hook up and use. Love I 
 This book was everything I could have wanted; it is comprehensive in its listing of genres, forms, poetry devices and history, and has some good psychological pointers about the writer's life and the need to allow yourself solitude and time away from workshop madness.  Its lists of books to read while writing, before writing and just plain writing literacy are superb, and its "writing challenges" (exercises for writing poems when you're stumped) are super.  I'm working my way through them, day by day 
 In working with clients who have compulsive hoarding issues, this book is truly one of my "bibles." I'm on my second reading, and plan to re-read it every year or so, to keep fresh on the valuable information and insights. The text is easy to read and understand, whether you have hoarding issues or live/work with someone who does. This is an extremely valuable resource and I would recommend it to both groups 
 Liz Greene explodes the caricature of Saturn as the gloomy cynical taskmaster who only joy is making people miserable. Please remember that Liz Greene does not write for the casual dilletante. Read the book deeply or do not read it at all 
 I read this book for a summer reading program at my high school last summer.  It was interesting and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys science textbook-like books.  It was "very non-fiction" w/ stats and  facts.  Therefore, if you like things that way, and you are also interested  in the subject, it's very helpful; a learning experience.  The book is  informative and helpful, some backing to common myths, some scientific  backing to rumors floating around.  The downfall is that it CAN get boring  and takes forever to read. It's to be read in multiple sittings.  In  conclusion, it is either great or terrible, depending on your interests 
 Former Wall Street tech investor and electrical engineer Kessler is trying to find the next big thing that Silicon Valley can bring its economies of scale to in the form of ever increasing processing power at ever lower cost. He believes that computing (hardware and software) can do for medicine what it has done for banking and retail - replace people with automation, save lots of money and improve results. As a technical, but not medical, person I find his vision of a medical revolution in the next decade or so is fairly compelling.  The shift he envisages is from one from often futile, expensive and invasive treatment of advanced congestive heart disease, stroke and cancer to one of early detection leading to less invasive, less costly and more effective treatment. The exciting thing about his vision is that it seems to rely less on speculative technologies like nanobots and futuristic drugs, that may be viable in a couple of decades, and more on technologies that already exist and are in use but need to be improved upon to be more cost effective and more precise. Imaging and detection of specific protein markers for various cancers feature large in his vision.   The book is full of amusing anecdotes and characterizations and is a narrative reminiscent of Hiaasen's novels of his quest to try and understand how the technologies of Silicon Valley can be applied to medicine, a quest that covers trade shows, conversations with medical researchers, venture capitalists and so on. This book may not be for the prudish, politically correct or for those that just want the facts. Otherwise you'll find it a surprisingly entertaining read given the subject matter, the coverage of which did not disappoint either.  
 Friedman's writing is consistently thoughtful, and this book is no exception. I appreciate deeply the care with which this book has been prepared. It belongs in every thinking person's library 
 I had been wanting to read this book for many years. Now that I actually read it, it doesn't completely live up to my expectations. The book is a little outdated in some ways, and the writing skills of Stephen King improved in later work. It's not the greatest vampire novel ever written. However, it is still very good. The story is original, not really scary but certainly macabre, and there's a lot of social critisism in the book as well (sometimes a bit too much). 
 Combines the right mix of imagery, character building, ... everthing.  Descriptions of arson fires is spooky.  A great ending.  This is my first book by Jeffery Deaver, or William Jefferies - whoever he is.  It won't be my last 
 Every CD that I own of Bon Jovi's is a hit, and this one is no exception.  Bon Jovi just keeps pouring the music out without disappointment.  It's a must have for the die hard Bon Jovi fans!! 
 This video delves into the people and the events of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, John Berendt's wildly popular non-fiction novel about the sleepy, isolated city of Savannah, Georgia.  It was great to finally see the video, and found it quite informative and interesting.  Particularly interesting, was the interview with the crime scene photographer, who has with him some of the pictures he took that day--most notably that of Hansford's over the gun he was supposedly going to fire.  The video also does well in documenting the varying opinions of other Savannians towards the whole Midnight phenomena.  Missing from the video, for obvious reasons, is refence to Lee Adler and Luther Driggers.  Also, the video does not go into the issue of race, which Berendt readily discussed in the book.  
 A thoroughly satisfying sequel to a book I grew up loving.  It took me forever to get to Good Wives, but when I did, it was like coming home.  What a treat to meet up with my favorite childhood characters in this delicious heartwarming book 
 When I was growing up in the Sunshine Housing up Big Creek, my Dad was a shift boss at the mine.  From the time I was a little girl I always wanted to go underground to see what it was like, but never got the chance.  Dad retired from the Sunshine (with emphysema from the rock dust) in 1971 and then a few months later my Mom passed away - exactly one month before the fire.  So many of those names in the back of the book are familiar to me.  Dad lost a lot of good friends on May 2 and now I know why his life really ended right then - it just took him 7 years to lay down. I had moved away from the Silver Valley long before the fire so I really appreciate Gregg Olsen for bringing that period of my life back and opening my eyes to exactly what my Dad and his friends faced every day.  I highly recommend this book to anyone (like me) who ever wondered about what it's like underground....   Thanks for taking me there at last Gregg, it was quite a journey 
 For the parents who are interested in the child development and want to follow the ebb and flow of the child development, as the family grows togeather in to the loving unit of the society. 
 As a lifetime sufferer of severe IBS, I recommend this book to all my fellow IBSers nationwide.  My IBS doc in Dallas (Dr. John Hyatt) recently had me try Pimentel's treatment methodology (Xifaxan followed by Zelnorm) with incredible results.  Read this book, talk to your doctor about it, and if all else fails, go see Hyatt 
 Be a person that adores cats and dogs, I found these stories to be wonderful! 
 McCain et al write very well and I was impressed by his style.  The writing was not the only style with which I became familiar but the "style" of the man himself, John McCain.  This was a truthful, revealing account of a man of honor who is presently in an oft less-than-honorable profession.  We can only hope the remainder of his career echoes with laud that of his grandfather and father.  I believe this read is one to add to one's readings of autobiographies / biographies. 
 This movie is the funniest, cutest, most inspiring movie I've seen in a long time! The movie is done so purely and simply. This instantly sets you back to the fourth grade sock-hop when ballroom classes would've done you a lot of good. After having seen this, I'm definately putting my kids in ballroom classes. 
 I was surprised to learn about the families and subjects depictured in this book. All looks so natural and uninhibited 
 Thea's Halo book is about the unknown, to most people, genocide of the Greeks of Pontus (Black Sea region of present day Turkey), committed by the Movement of the New Turks and its leader Mustapha Kemal, later known as Ataturk, whose aim was to create a "Turkey for the Turks". Greeks had settled to the area of Minor Asia (nowadays Turkey) since 1000 BC, where they created civilization and Christianity flourished, until Turkish warrior tribes came to the area at the end of the 10th century AC.  Mrs Themia-Sano gives to all of us a great lesson of courage, faith and will to live. Thank you Mrs Thea Halo for writing this book so that more people all over the world are able to learn the truth.   Unfortunately, MODERN TURKISH STATE not only has never recognized these crimes committed by Ottoman Turks under official orders, but FOLLOWED THE SAME POLICY on the Greek Christian minority of Istanbul and the 2 islands of Imvros (Gokceada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada). This is a minority Turkey was obliged to protect after having signed the International Treaty of Lausanne in1923, the treaty that creates the Turkish Republic. From 120.000 Greeks in 1924 less than 1700 remain today in Turkey, due to SEVERE PERSECUTIONS-violations of Lausanne Treaty, such as illegal heavy taxation, deportations, confiscations of property (houses, schools, churches and other buildings of the Greek community). A pogrom in 1955 and deportations in 1964 were decisive actions for the elimination of the Christian minority from Turkey.   I WONDER why most Turks refuse to admit that some of their ancestors, under state orders, committed these genocides, as EVEN TODAY Turkey is heavily criticized on human rights' issues regarding the Kurds, the few remaining Christians of the country but ALSO the Turks themselves (e.g. journalists).  The ONLY WAY for Turkey to become a true democratic state is to confront its past and accept its responsibilities against non-Turks and non-Muslims indigenous people of the place today  called Turkey. The sooner Turks realize this necessity, the better for their country, themselves and their children. THIS BOOK can be a first step for them to know REAL facts that REAL people lived. 
 its hard to have a personal favorite song. i would have preferred a DVD of matching vidios. 
 This book offers solid insight into the complexities of organizational staffing. While other reviewers have commented that merit pay and job evaluation have little place in today's business world, my company uses these tools very successfully.  The authors offer theoretical support for these concepts, but do not offer sufficient "real world" examples to provide guidance for those who have no prior experience in staffing. The academic approach that the book takes in dealing with these issues is to be expected from a textbook, but additional examples, possibly case studies, would be valuable for those who do not have the benefit of a course instructor 
 Excellent machine but be ware you MUST keep this machine clean at the steam/hot water nozzle.    If it gets blocked the first thing it will do is ask to be ventilated .. then the pressure cut off switch may 'pop' and the machine may seem to lock up - there is no autoreset and the pressure switch must be manually reset inside. It's not worth £s sending for repair - but not really a user fix. so be warned - keep your nozzles clean 
 Probably the most energetic album in a decade from this prolific songwriter whom I will not hesitate to call a genius. That energy no doubt is due to the presence of longtime pals Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey, among others, who bring the Rock to Hitchcock's game. As a result, songs like "Adventure Rocketship," and "Ole Tarantula" take us back to the Soft Boys universe. "Belltown Ramble" is a guided tour through a typically Hitchcockian landscape that is somewhere between the steppes of Uzbekistan and the streets of San Francisco. Fans who lost interest in his work after the Egyptians broke up will find much to enjoy here.  
 My Book Review  The book My Louisiana Sky is about a young girl named Tiger, she has a very rough life. Both of her parents are slow. So her grandma takes care of them most of the time. But one day something horrible happens. I recommend this book because it is sad and interesting, and if you want to know what the horrible thing is then read the book.         In the sad and interesting book you will find the themes of love, friendship, and caring. Tiger and James show friendship when he stays with her instead of going to play base ball with all of his guy friends. The book shows love when Tiger helps her grandma make dinner for her parents. It also shows love when Tiger helps her parents because they are slow. It shows caring when Aunt Dorrie Kay comes to take care of Tigers mom and dad.         The characters in the book are sweet and kind. Aunt Dorrie Kay is sweet when she helps out grandma with house work. Tiger is kind when she takes her mom to the book mobile so she can get some books. Even though her parents are slow they are still very sweet to her, they try. Aunt dorrie kay is sweet to take her to the movies.       The setting is in Louisiana where mom, dad, grandma, and Tiger live it's a small house. Aunt dorrie Kay lives in Botun Rouge in a huge house. Tiger goes to live there for a little bit but then she comes back to live with her mom and dad. That's all im going to tell you about the book so if you want to know more about the book then read the book My Louisiana Sky.  
 (I am slightly confused about why this movie is called "Badge" on Amazon and "The Badge" on IMDb and the rental site Netflix.)  That being said...The Badge is a movie about small-town Louisiana politics, about family struggles, about coming to terms with suicidal mothers and homosexual brothers, and about the life-long struggle for justice in crimes against strippers and transsexuals.  The plot focuses on the murders of a New Orleans transsexual within the conservative LaSalle parish.  The reigning politicos of the parish don't want the alcoholic, local-boy sheriff (played by Billy Bob Thornton) to investigate the matter _too_ seriously and draw too much negative attention to the parish.  Sheriff Billy Bob is willing to play along with the game until his party tries to run him off the ticket for the next election.  The action is truly about Billy Bob's sheriff character finding his own true self among the corrupt local and state politicians.  He manages both to find himself and to serve justice to the underground sex community (which serves the state politicians in a no-questions-asked deal).  The filmmakers perfectly portray the atmosphere of lose parishes in Louisiana.  The viewer will be absorbed into the good-old-boy network  of doing business, as well as the desperation of anyone who tries to buck the system or hurt Louisiana's political advancement.  Anyone who enjoys this movie should check out Billy Bob Thornton in the sleeper Chyrstal. 
 These are well worth the money for your Nextel Phone!  Although it may not list it, from Experience, these batteries fit 95% of all the Nextel phones.  Take a look at your phone battery to see if it's the same shape.  The color will be different as these have a white cover.    They are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store.  Plus these were NEVER used before!  Unlike the celluar store battery, these batteries come in a box, with the battery in shrink wrap, so you know the battery has not been used.  When you buy then in the cellular store, they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed (and you'd never know it) plus there is no shrink wrap!  Ever buy a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months?  Hmmm, I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one?  Would you know????  These batteries are well worth it!  Buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days

 I would first like to state that I am not a member of the Mormon church, however, I have studied western US history and am quite familiar with the church and its beliefs. That said, it would seem that there is some venting going on in the review section! From what I can gather there are a few "anti-mormons" out to besmudge the reputation of a great and God-fearing man, and quite a few members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who are trying to strike back. May I remind you that this is a book review, not a religion review? Ok, so my review of this book.  I found it to be, as many others have, a simple and delightful read outlining what Mr. Hinckley believes to be the virtues most lacking in society today.  I have to agree with Mr. Hinckley in that those virtues are sorely needed in our world.  I did not feel that it was PR fodder or that it is to be respected more than a book by Rev. Billy Graham simply because of who wrote it.  I am sure that in some circles, most notably the Mormon community, it will be revered for that very reason, but I feel that the rest of Christendom should respect it as much as any book written by a good, upstanding, pious, self-respecting individual.  I also feel that people of other, non-Christian faiths or creeds should find most or all of this book to be applicable in daily-living.   In response to some of the attacks on the character of Gordon Bitner Hinckley, his beliefs and actions, I will say this: I truly believe that Mr. Hinckley "stands for something," that which he believes.  I truly think that he believes that he speaks with God, I believe that sometimes I do as well.  As an example, I feel that when I pray with a concern about somethin in my life, I feel God telling me that all will be well, even if it is not the way I planned or would prefer.  As for the question of blacks and the priesthood, I have read accounts and interviews with Mr. Hinckley in which he expresses the anguish he felt in earlier days when this was the practice.  He tells of Spencer Kimball praying over and over for it to be time to include all.  I can see where this practice may have begun.  In early days of the Mormon church, members suffered great persecution.  They were accused of stirring up slaves against their "masters" on more than one occasion.  I feel it is possible that intense persecution could have led to this policy.   As regards the financial accusations against Gordon Hinckley and the church he leads, he lives on a very modest stipend.  The money from the book would not be lining pockets already heavy from tithes collected from the members.  I would remind you of the great humanitarian aid contributions made by the church to the rest of the world.  I personally have met with many recipients of this aid including hurricaine refugees, families in poor countries who have been helped by the Benson Institue, and indiviuals down on their luck needing aid here in the USA.  None of these people were members of the church that so willingly helped them.   I have met members of the Mormon church who I didn't like.  Some I REALLY didn't like, but in my work and studies I have met people of all faiths that were crass or rude to me or my associates.  I feel that many churches have great values and that when the members live by them they are wonderful people, caring and kind, and that there are members of all of those churches who do not and are difficult to be around.  I think that Gordon Hinckley understands that.  I also know that he knows that his book is about an ideal that would be hard to achieve as a society.  I don't think it would be possible for a man to live for 95 years and not know that there are unethical people out there, of all faiths and creeds, and that to expect everyone to live by the virtues he outlines in his book is unreasonable.  
 Whenever we take this bike to the park, boys and men of every description crown around it in awe.  My son, who is seven and so far not athletic at all, loves the recognition, not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching.  We just wish it came in an adult size 
 I was so suprised how fast I received the Dome Tent. I have not had a chance to hook it up to my car yet because it has been snowing here, but I am really excited to use it this summer.  Thank you!!! :- 
 This book was extremely helpful to me, covered everything I needed and more, thoroughly recommend it 
 First of all, this book is an easy read. Now, don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean the book is not worth reading it, this means just that the author uses a lay language, not much profundity, and this is a short book (specially short for a history of medicine). Anyway, Porter's book treats every epoch in medicine history, if you don't intend to spend much time reading about medicine history, well, this is your book, it's complete, concise and comprehensibly 
 Danny Briere, a friend, is a top industry consultant who built Telechoice into an industry leader.  I also write about technology, so I know his professionial work. The book shows another side to him - playful and joyous. This stuff is fun - and it ain't worth a darn if you can't make it work. Briere and Hurley help you choose, plan, and solve the inevitable problems with a sense of humor. Very well done 
 This music collection is superb. I first obtained it on vinyl, and then on CD. It is one of my top three favorite Christmas albums, and I have over 75. This is an instrumental album that cannot grow tiring. It is a must-have.  
 I do not know how I would have gotten through my first experience having to use the DSM as a diagnostic tool for my graduate work in psychopathology without this book. I used it to work up all my case presentations, and they were always accurate. Thank you, James Morrison 
 good bang for the buck, fun, lightweight, escapist reading: just right a warm day, a shady tree and a crisp appl 
 This is not the "simple" version, though with practice, it's not too difficult.  I would not recommend this book for a beginner; but for an occasional player, the music is easy enough to call up on occasion.  The songs don't have that 'empty' sound like many songs transposed from orchestra to piano and, in my opinion, you could play them for an audience and receive applause 
 I ordered IZ's cd, "Facing Future" for his song, Over the Rainbow, to add to our Hawaii family vedio that I will be putting together when we go this summer. My kids loved his song! They make me play it everytime we ride with the top down! I guess they felt sorry for him once I shared IZ's past life and how he died. But over all we are enjoying it now and will enjoy it on our trip to Hawaii in June! I know when I am old and gry my children will remember me with this song!   
 The title of the book OXY is a misgnomer, because the book talks about all opium alkaloids, not just the semisynthetic narcotic Oxycodone (OxyContin TM-Purdue). The good: this book is an excellent revue of the opiate literature and includes the original pharmacologic and organic chemistry papers with their cited references. Also, there are various DEA and USDA reports on cultivation of poppies, the Golden Triangle of Laos, Myamar, China, Vietnam, etc. where illicit opium, morphine, and heroin are produced, as well as all the backyard processes of producing heroin. The bad: the introduction and opening chapter perpetuates some of the common myths about opiates, such as attributing "soldiers disease" (civil-war veterans hooked on opiates) to heroin. Heroin wasn't synthsized until 1873 and was only commercially distributed by Bayer in the 1890s. Also, the author referes to opiates as "poisons" which is a bit of hysteria. The ugly: in the first chapter there is a bit of ranting about "script doctors" and medicare fraud that has no place in the book. Indications for the use of the narcotics are mentioned, but without citing medical research or offering medical credentials by the author. But in summary, despite the bad and the ugly, this is an excellent book if you are an organic chemist, pharmacist, chemical engineer, practioner, pain patient, or heroin user to educate yourself about opiates. THIS BOOK NOR THIS REVIEW ADVOCATES THE USE, ABUSE, POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE, etc. etc. of the substances, plants, precursor chemicals, or laboratory apparatus mentioned in the book, most of which are illegal in the U.S. 
 It's easy to discount a book like Permission Marketing as being a book for...well, marketers. However, like all of Godin's books, the underlying message of this book is for anyone in management.   I won't try to summarize the contents of the book -- others have already done that. What I want to point out are what Godin identifies as the biggest stumbling blocks companies face in trying to implement the concepts in this book ('concepts' is not the right word -- 'truths' is a better fit). These stumbling blocks are: organizational problems, greed, and lack of foresight.   People read books like this and generally recognize the values they impart, but taking the nest step and implementing some of the changes necessary in an organization to reach these ideals is sometimes too difficult a task for a single person - and so changes are not implemented. Sometimes bureaucracy limits your company's ability to change, and only crashing and burning opens the door to change (if the company survives). Greed drives other companies to cut short long-term changes over short-term revenue. And as for foresight - if your company is focused on short-term revenue over long-term planning and building discipline around your strategy, your seeds of change will not be able to take root.  Ok, that last part sounded a bit preachy.  Ok, so what is the core of this book? My take is that it's all about loyalty and retention. Permission marketing is nothing more than building honest relationships with your customers, and doing what is necessary to keep them as customers.   As usual, Godin's delivery of these concepts is warm and fresh, and includes many examples from his own professional experience and from the fascinating world of Silicon Valley startups. To get the real value out of this book, however, it all goes back to those corporate stumbling blocks: readers need to recognize the stumbling blocks at their own companies, and take steps to remedy them. Like any 12-step recovery program, the first step is to admit there's a problem. If your company can do that, you're on your way 
 Man this album is the best. I found old out of print albums years ago at a library and have been looking for compilations ever since. This is not the same album set I found, but it opened me up to even more funk from the Motherland. This album is so funky you'd have to air out your house. Get it out of curiousity. Get it for pure afrofunk pleasure. For DJs- this is sample supreme 
 This book was purchased as a gift for my sister. She is a very busy mother of two and has told me that she was pleasantly surprised by how informative and helpful this book is. For someone who admittedly thought she had enough strategies and solutions of her own, she agrees that she learned more than a few new helpful tips from this book. She's already recommended it to friends.   
 This movie is awesome!  Basically, it talks about a startup dot com and takes you through the company timeline from the day the name was chosen until they had to close the doors.  A lot of interesting things happened along the way like a break-in, and  . . .well, I dont want to spoil it for you.  If you are thinking about owning your own business, you MUST watch this movie 
 This is perfect for working out, its small, has spiral, and very durable. Very durable, I've routinely tested it, unintentionally. The major reason this log is great is the fact you write in most of your information. The days aren't already printed in the log, so you can be even more accruate of how you workout.  One page consists of the following: three different rows to record your cardio activity, about 16 excercise rows where you would record the name of the particular excercise that you'll be dong, you heard right sixteen! Each row has 6 columns to record your sets, with boxes labled "Reps" and "Weight". And to top it all off, a notes section on the bottom. Belive me when I tell you, you will soon be giving this log 5 stars as well, when you see all the other garbage logs out there. Have a great workout 
 This book is amazing! It is a very engaging read and never gets stale. The knowledge you get out of it is priceless. The tactics I learned in this book were very successful when applied to swing trading for me. Highly Recommend 
 I really enjoyed this book. I checked it out at my local library. I will be sure to use it again, again. Hope you enjoy it as well 
 It does sound like the people that had technical problems didn't slow down and follow the directions. I moved a few exits down the highway and found my new water supply to be very hard. Sticky, brown scum that I had to scrub off at least weekly. This product saves me from all that; I've now gone 3 months without seeing any of this scum. Also, I hadn't used a versatile head like this before which provided a nice rhythm on my stiff neck. I was skeptical with the price initially, now I'm signing up for regular replacements. 
 Chapter 1 has extra relevance at present, as its subject, Omar Bakri Mohammed has been splashed over the front pages of British newspapers recently for supporting suicide bombers and apparently describing the London bombers as the "fantastic four". It seems he has now been kicked out of the country because his presence, according to the Home Secretary is "not conducive to the public good". So, it's interesting to see that back in 1999 he was calling for a holy war in the UK and for the black flag of Islam to be raised over the Prime Minister's residence. There have been newspaper reports that he may return to have a free heart operation in the UK later this year.  I enjoyed this book, but It's a shame that the "Secret Rulers of the World" TV series that accompanied it isn't more widely available. 
  This is an in-depth analysis about the many problems in the public school system in America.  While reading it I often thought of Thomas Sowell's damming account of the public school system as detailed in his book "Inside American Education."  John Stormer covers many of the same areas and expresses many of the same concerns, but John Stormer does it from a religious standpoint.  Both books are very concerned about the declining academic standards in the public school system, both books are explore how children are being brainwashed in public schools, and both books are very concerned with the political agenda of the NEA.    John Stormer starts off by saying that before you can decide on what is the purpose of an education, you have to think about:  1) What is the nature of man? 2) What is his purpose?  Most public school officials have a humanist point of view about the nature and purpose of man.  John Stormer points out this leads them in fundamentally different directions than most Christian want to go.  John Stormer quotes a number of professional educators who over the years have declared their intent to remake society, to "fix it up."  His opposition to this appears to be what drove him to write this book.  He is concerned about the declining academic standards, and the first chapter documents how each year students are performing worse and worse in math, spelling, reading, history, and so on.  Most of the rest of the book focuses how in different ways public schools are trying to remake society.  There were a number of interesting points made in the book.  For example John Stormer points out that it doesn't take years to teach Sex Education, the basics can be taught in an hour, maybe a couple hours if you really take your time.  The reason Sex Education is taught for so long is to wear down the values being taught at home.  Many at public schools are looking to have schools replace the family.    If you are concerned about the decline in American Education over the last fifty years, but you aren't interested in a religious point of view, check out "Inside American Education."  If you are a Christian, and want more information on what is happening in public schools, this book is a good one to check out.  "None Dare Call It Education" is well written and well documented.  
 Upon reading the glowing recommendations of these glasses,we promptly ordered them and now use them almost daily!Excellent for all types of wine,a nice value and a great "beginner" set.A word of caution;they DO scratch easily,treat them with TLC 
 We have struggled to fing girls jeans that are not tight fitting and imbelished with this and that. These are the jeans. They are just a nice pair of plain well made jeans. We were very happy to find them--Finally!! 
 A murder mystery set in 1500s Istanbul, one of the most exotic cities in the world.  Each chapter is a first person narrative from a different character, the very first from the man who has just been killed, catching your attention immediately.  The murderer has 2 voices, one his real identity not revealed as the culprit, and one as the killer.  Dogs, trees, paintings and the devil all have a chapter or two as well making the story move along in a strong quick fascinating way, like going down a path of stepping stones towards the finish.  There is a love story, and a story of the forces of traditional Islamic art facing the beginning of an invasion of Western art ideals (the angst and reactions of the characters is insight into some aspects of the depth and manner of the religion of Islam).  This book is operating on many levels, all of them great.  A unusual style and a great multi-level story, as if the dense intricate beautiful tile-work of the Ottomans became literature.  Highest recommendations. 
 For those interested in awakening, this book will be invaluable.  I read it as soon as I received it, and am now reading it a second time.  There is so much in it and each time I have found it calming.  
 having read many of koontz's works, i have found this to be one of his best. i am biased, though, in that i appreciate koontz's use of psychology in his works. while many if not most of his writings could be classified as psychological thrillers, this work goes beyond in my opinion. koontz has done his research and depicts, in a very real way, the fear and debilitation that a psychological disorder can cause. that being said, this book is not recommended for those with a tendency toward anxiety or excessive fear. koontz's writing is very powerful and very real 
 I am just about to finish this translation of Tasso's venerable crusade and I just had to express how wonderful I think it is.  I have to admit I experienced a slight bit of trepidation before beginning this work, but I was found to be foolish.  Not only is the work readable, it loses none of its beauty in the translation.  I have found myself reading page to page hungrily.  Who needs mass market paperback best sellers when oen has such a unique and beautifully translated work at one's fingertips.  I wholeheartedly recommend this translation 
 Gary has done all of us who find ourselves disenchanted with the structure and purpose of involuntary and (sadly)unavoidable organizational membership a tremendous service. I can't say much more than has been said in the other reviews but let me just add that this book cuts across the public and private sector and gets to the root of how identity issues are endoctrinated in our most basic educational experiences. I work at the cross section between private business and public ed. and the advent of No Child Left Behind has created organizational system wrought with the problems Gary adresses. What's worse is that present students are by products of these organizational ills and the sytemic issues they are subject to during these formative years will infect at least the next generation of leaders and citizens. Change can come from the bottom up or the top down but in either case this book provides the architectural design for rebuilding what needs demolition 
 movie. You are almost tired by the time it is over. All actors were superb. Will Smith is perfect for these types of movies because of his wit and seriousness. He just brings this character to life and we are routing for him until the end 
 Michael Ondaatje is a wonder. His Toronto is a place of mystery and magic: nuns falling out of the sky, midnight puppet shows and self-disappeared tycoons. It was a pleasure to read - each word is perfect, and paints a picture of love, despair, and what it means to find yourself.  This should appeal to people who liked Jonathan Safran Foer's sparkler "Everything Is Illuminated", although this novel is not as humorous. Both books, however, are examinations of how a person finds himself and what it means to have a history. Lovely, lovely work 
 I picked up this book at a library sale and had it for two years before I read it.  I now want to read all of Anya Seton's books. My copy was issued in 1965, I was 3 years old at the time.  I am an avid book reader and I am especially fond of historical fiction, (learn and be entertained at the same time).  I agree with the other reviewer's.  A newly re-published boxed set of Seton's works would be high on my list 
  The book that I read was about this little girl who used to love when her mom used to read to her. When she got to kindergarden every body was learning how to pronounce the words. She was always behing. when she got to second grade every body used to know how to read, but she was the only one who was still pronouncing the words.Then she move and thought everything was going to be better. Then every one teasted her. She med a teacher who help her after school. She started to learn how to read. The little girl was the asthur 
 You don't have to be a fan of Ike to enjoy this book.  You'll learn a lot about Mike and tournament fishing reading this book.  I read this book in one sitting and have thought about picking it up for another round on several ocassions 
 As For Me and My House provides a descriptive tale about a preacher and his wife during the depression.  Written by the hand of the wife, who remains nameless, the book incorporates vast imagery to help portray the feeble lifestyle they were trapped within.  Mr. Bentley, unable to motivate himself to move beyond his unsatisfying profession as a preacher, lives in unhappiness, bringing his wife into oppression with him.  Animal imagery is prevalent, as the town and its people are described in such terms.  They all cower and protect themselves; with the exception of Judith, who "scales the wind" at the beginning until she discovers her own sexuality and becomes the earth....Can air continue to have 'life' when submersed into the ground 
 I don't even know how to describe this book, because it gives me the chills, in a good way though. I only started casting spells recently. I am a beginner too. So far I have done 2 spells from the book and they both worked!!! I am not even a Wiccan and honestly before buying this book I never believed in any of this until I saw the reviews and bought the book. The spells are pretty easy to follow and the ingredients are easy to find too. I highly recommend it!!!!! 
 When I first heard of this project, which had John Denver's blessing before his death, I was excited, but unsure that any illustrator could do justice to John's songs.  Christopher Canyon has perfectly incorporated the love of children and of nature that John Denver shared in his music. Now I'm looking forward to all the books in this series.  Great work, Dawn Publications.I was so overwhelmed by the copies I'd bought for my grandchildren, I turned around and bought one for my friend who, like me, remembers John Denver's lessons daily, and misses his voice always.. 
 Carl Hiaasen sure does like to dramatically kill people off in his books.... still they are some of the funniest, wharped moments I've ever experienced.  Quirky, Comic Genius.  The audio version is masterfully read by George Wilson 
 that is no exaggeration, and i have no affiliation with weber!  i use this book and "weber's real grilling" 4 to 5 times a week, every week.  all these great recipes may be done indoors as well (stovetop grill pan or broiling) with nearly equal success, so don't be dissuaded by winter, or even by not owning a grill.  i don't use any other cookbooks at all, although i plan to get "weber's art of the grill".  the key here, i believe, is jamie purviance.  these recipes are phenomenally impressive, and while some are time-consuming (but well worth the effort!), most are less than an hour from start to finish.  many are ridiculouly easy.  i recommended this book to everyone i know, and all have raved about it.  i owe it to jamie to give him a plug...after all, he changed my life!  the writing and photography are top notch as well 
 Burr Leonard, the instructor of the workouts, freely admits she's in her late 50s and I just want to say that when I'm her age, I want her body! With her long, lean physique, she looks incredible. I don't know if the Bar Method is all she does to stay in shape, but judging from this DVD set, it must help. The approach is part Lotte Berk, part dance-inspired (Leonard, in fact, studed the Lotte Berk method in the 1980s), and the workouts are way tougher than they look. This exercise style relies a lot on small, subtle movements that, if done properly, are highly effective. I really enjoy my heavier weight workouts, but these routines are a nice change, and they work my muscles nearly as hard, but in a different way 
 "All my life, as a girl, as a professional consultant and now as a retired elder I have shaped myself to be able to answer the internal question:  'Am I truly making a difference in the world? Am I truly living my beliefs through the contributions?'  And one day, some years ago I found Geoff Bellman and The Consultant's Calling.  I wanted to shout out loud in my room, " Yes, that's it!  That's what it's all about!" It affirmed for me everything I believed... and we need affirmation with regularity, because it's often lonely out there.  This book has been an inspiration for me and the most important part of reading it over and over is that it affirms what's best in me and my work.  It was relevant and spoke to me then as it does now. Reaquaint yourself with the new edition of Consultant's Calling.  It's a gem.&quot 
 For people interested in the theory and psychology of cinema, this is a great starting point and is a must have in any collection. J. Dudley Andrew breaks down the theories of Mitry, Metz, Arheim, and Bazin, among others, into easy to understand chapters without losing the essense of the theories.  This book and the material are both so interesting that this will have you hooked on film theory.  Instead of purchasing the individual books by each theorist, Andrew's book is the way to go in more ways than one. It is very easy to understand, which some books on film theory aren't, and he uses great quotes from each of the theorists. Andrew followed this up with "Concepts in Film Theory" which is the opposite of this book. It is much more difficult to understand and follow so beware 
 This is the kind of mystery that you look forward to getting back to and that will get read quickly but will not keep you up until 3 in the morning because you can't bear to put it down.  That's not such a bad thing -- sometimes those keep-you-up-all-night books aren't such a good idea.  I've read quite a few in this mystery series and character Sharon McCone feels like an old friend.  In this book, there are a number of references to events and people in previous books that might make parts of this book less accessible to new readers, although they really don't have much to do with the plot.  The plot involves the arrest of Jules, one of Sharon's employees (Sharon runs a very successful detective agency in San Francisco).  Jules is accused of stealing and using a credit card from the client in a case she was assigned to, and for reasons that aren't very convincing, even before Jules is even arraigned, Sharon's agency is being threatened with losing its license to operate because she is responsible for her employees' actions on the job.  Sharon has to prove that Jules didn't do it in order to save the agency.  Although Jules has a colorful background, Sharon believes in her innocence, and it quickly becomes apparent that this is a frame with Sharon's agency as the real target.  The plot then becomes Sharon trying to find out who is framing Jules, which involves finding out who has a grudge against her that is motivating this frame.  I wouldn't describe this as one of those mysteries that you ought to be able to solve if you read the clues correctly -- it's more of a procedural, where you follow along with Sharon as she tries to solve the case.  The real strength of the book is Sharon's likeability -- she's someone you enjoy spending time with in a book -- and Muller's writing skills, which create a whole exciting San Francisco world. 
 Anyone who is interested in philosophy's great relics but mainly reads books in English should see the Cambridge University Press translation of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood published in 1997 sometime to check the Table of Contents on pages 85-90, and compare it with Kant's original Table of Contents from 1781 on page 125, to observe how many parts of this book have become so well known that scholars consulting this monument to philosophical thought feel a need for 132 page references to find whatever interest in Kant they might have at a particular moment.  Such a summary might have been open before Nietzsche when he wrote in section 110 of THE GAY SCIENCE that "Over immense periods of time the intellect produced nothing but errors. . . .  Such erroneous articles of faith, which were continually inherited, until they became almost part of the basic endowment of the species, include the following:  that there are enduring things; that there are equal things; that there are things, substances, bodies; that a thing is what it appears to be; that our will is free; that what is good for me is also good in itself."  Kant was concerned with transcendental philosophy, the general problem of pure reason, but in I, Transcendental doctrine of elements, Division one, Book II, Chapter II, Section III, 3, A on "principle of persistence of substance" can be found on page 299;  Division two, Book II, Chapter II, Section IX, III, "The possibility of causality through freedom" can be found on page 535; and in II, Transcendental doctrine of method, Chapter II, Section II, "On the ideal of the highest good" can be found on page 676.  Kant's practice of using large heavy type in the text for key terms makes his points much easier to locate in the Cambridge University Press edition, which features some of the heaviest type I ever saw in a book.  Page numbers for the A (1781) and B (1787) editions are located in the outer margins, making it easy to locate quotations by later philosophers who frequently invite their students to read the original work.  Schopenhauer, in particular, was adamant that Kant spoiled the 1781 edition when he removed pages 348 to 392 and "introduced a number of remarks that controverted it" (THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION, translated by E. F. J. Payne, Vol. 1, p. 435) in 1787.  This part of the Second Book of the Transcendental Dialectic, First Chapter, The paralogisms of pure reason, was originally intended by Kant to illustrate forms of reason which imitate logical thought, and appealed strongly to Schopenhauer as a basis for his own philosophy, which he declared had placed Will in place of Kant's thing-in-itself as claimed in the 22nd chapter in the second book of WWR, vol. 1, pp. 110-112.  Kant was not trying to make things easier for the philosophers who followed him by providing an easy platform they could use to proclaim their own views, as even Schopenhauer discerned when he complained that Fichte had "succeeded in turning the public's attention from Kant to himself, and in giving to German philosophy the direction in which it was afterwards carried further by Schelling, finally reaching its goal in the senseless sham wisdom of Hegel."  (WWR, Vol. 1, pp. 436-437).  Schopenhauer does not appear in the index of the Cambridge University Press edition of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, but the index can be used to locate a few notes on Swedenborg.  In Gregory R. Johnson's Introduction for KANT ON SWEDENBORG, Kant's knowledge of Swedenborg's writings are linked to some of the key ideas in Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON.  "Finally, Swedenborg claims that his visions of the spiritual world do not show the spirit world as it is in itself.  Instead, his visions are spatio-temporal representations of a non-spatio-temporal reality.  Spiritual realities take on this spatio-temporal garb to accommodate themselves to the requirements of a finite intellect.  These teachings presage such central tenets of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON (1781, 1787) as transcendental idealism and the ideality of space and time."  (KANT ON SWEDENBORG, p. xviii).  The notes about Swedenborg on pages 731 and 753 of Kant's CRITIQUE call attention to his "ironic attack on Swedenborgian spiritualism in DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER (1766)" and spiritual qualities lampooned then which reappear in Kant's elucidation of the limits imposed by the general conditions of experience:  " . . . or a special fundamental power of our mind to intuit the future (not merely, say, to deduce it), or, finally, a faculty of our minds to stand in a community of thoughts with other men (no matter how distant they may be) -- these are concepts the possibility of which is entirely groundless, because it cannot be grounded in experience and its known laws, and without this it is an arbitrary combination of thoughts that, although it contains no contradiction, still can make no claim to objective reality, thus to the possibility of the sort of object that one would here think.  As far as reality is concerned, it is evidently intrinsically forbidden to think it in concreto without getting help from experience, because it can only pertain to sensation, as the matter of experience, and does not concern the form of the relation that one can always play with in fictions."  (CPR, A 222-223, B 270, p. 324).  For example of Kant's always already unthink fictions, I would like to suggest the experience of a rock concert, in which a crowd knows the most popular song of the evening.  It could be Liz Phair, doing a recent song, `stars and planets' in which "You know it's just the same old story.  Stars rise and stars fall.  But the ones that shine the brightest aren't stars at all.  They're the planets just like us. . . .  They're the planets that unite us.  And from big to small.  We all shine shine shine."  So we are 
 In this book, Tesla himslef explains the inner workings of his mind. To me, knowing how he actually came up with his inventions is the best any Tesla book could possibly get 
 A must for participants in math contests and  their trainers, and a real  treasure for all math lovers and  problem-solving fans. The author focuses  on the main ideas,  techniques and strategies needed to solve the kind of  problems  found at "elementary" math competitions, up to the IMO  level.  With more than 1300 problems and examples, it is also an  excellent  source for teachers in search of interesting,  non-routine problems to  challenge their students, stimulate  their creativity or even to motivate  the study of some subjects. My only concern is that, at the sight of such  abundance of  material, some students might be overwhelmed or discouraged.   Ideally, a qualified teacher should select the problems and  assign them in  adequate doses to the math strength of their students 
 Their last effort, Everything You Thought ...etc., was a little slice of alt country roots rock perfection. So at first listen to Slippage, the absence of banjo and mandolin behind that viscous electric guitar is disconcerting. But once you realize that the goal here was to make a similarly definitive ROCK record, you see that they nailed it. The songwriting is a notch better, if that is even possible. There is only one song on here I skip, and I know many others love that one. This CD hasn't left my player in 2 weeks. "Find The Out" alone is worth the price. Buy it. You will love it 
 I really enjoy this album.  Has pretty good variety.  I love "Hear me Out".  That song just resonates with me somehow.  Great album, smooth as silk voice, nice beats.  
 The film (one of my favorites) inspired me to acquire the book and as usual I found the book to be far superior to the film. The norm since converting a book to film is similiar to condensing.   The book did lack in factual detail which would have made it longer and far more interesting, as a factual historical novel. As a piece on racial discrimination and women's fight for equality it is the best of reading.  For those interested in the subject the book and film are well worth adding to your collection.     
  Hello Nasty, the Beastie Boys' fifth album, is a head-spinning listen loaded with analog synthesizers, old drum machines, call-and-response vocals, freestyle rhyming, futuristic sound effects, and virtuoso turntable scratching. The Beasties have long been notorious for their dense, multi-layered explosions, but Hello Nasty is their first record to build on the multi-ethnic junk culture breakthrough of Check Your Head, instead of merely replicating it.   Moving from electro-funk breakdowns to Latin-soul jams to spacey pop, Hello Nasty covers as much ground as Check Your Head or Ill Communication, but the flow is natural, like Paul's Boutique, even if the finish is retro-stylized. Hiring DJ Mixmaster Mike (one of the Invisibl Skratch Piklz) turned out to be a masterstroke; he and the Beasties created a sound that strongly recalls the spare electronic funk of the early '80s, but spiked with the samples and post-modern absurdist wit that have become their trademarks. On the surface, the sonic collages of Hello Nasty don't appear as dense as Paul's Boutique, nor is there a single as grabbing as "Sabotage," but given time, little details emerge, and each song forms its own identity.   A few stray from the course, and the ending is a little anticlimactic, but that doesn't erase the riches of Hello Nasty - the old-school kick of "Super Disco Breakin'" and "The Move"; Adam Yauch's crooning on "I Don't Know"; Lee "Scratch" Perry's cameo; and the recurring video game samples, to name just a few. The sonic adventures alone make the album noteworthy, but what makes it remarkable is how it looks to the future by looking to the past. There's no question that Hello Nasty is saturated in old-school sounds and styles, but by reviving the future-shock rock of the early '80s, the Beasties have shrewdly set themselves up for the new millennium.  
 If you thought Jon Heder was a good actor in "Napoleon Dynamite", you love his acting in this movie!   This movie is not only funny, wacky and fairly original in terms of plot line, but the actors also do a terrific job in playing their roles. The storyline keeps you guessing as to what will happen next..... So, I'd say this movie has a nice mix of both humor and storyline 
 Atomic Physics is based upon a series of lectures on physics that Born gave in Germany in 1933.  Since then it has been translated into English updated significantly as physics developed.  This means that the book represents sound physics, and not the relatively undeveloped 1933 picture of the physics.  I should note that the title of the book is slightly misleading. The original German edition was called modern physics. However, the publisher of the English version already had a book called modern physics, so the English version was renamed Atomic Physics.    Born covers a wide range of topics dealing with the gasses, elementary particles, the structure of the nucleus, atoms, molecules.  He has written the book in the context of describing the historical development of each topic.  This is done in a flowing style by only including important equations in the text.  Derivations and so fourth are placed in the 130 pages of appendices in the back of the book.  This allows the text to tell a story without the burden of constant discontinuities due to equations.   If you want to see the maths, just flip to the back of the book.  I would classify this book somewhere between popular science and a textbook.  Like a popular science it tells a story, it flows and readable.  People with some knowledge of physics can read this book and learn a lot form it.  Even without the appendices.  On the other hand, like a text it doesn't give hand wavy, simplified descriptions of the physics.  This is good hard physics.  While I wouldn't call this book a text, it is far too general for that, it does give an excellent overview of the development and character of modern physics from one of the people who was there in the thick of it.  I highly recommend it to any person that is acquainted with physics.  Non-scientists would probably benefit more from reading something like Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe.    This is a great book, it is well written, structure and relevant.  It fully deserves five stars.  To reiterate what other reviewers have said, I wish present-day textbooks were written this well.  
 With the companion books Sarah, plain and tall skylark represents acceptance for love, tradition, value and companionship for other as well as yourself. As student read this book it will deal and discussion separation, love of ones illness, plant history, and cultural values of others and they deal with real life situations.   
 This was a very informative and entertaining book. From one who has suffers from SLEEP PARALYSIS, it was an eye opener to know that if I had gone to one of these therapists, they would have labeled me either"an Alien Abductee or Satanic Abuse Victim". I recommend it for anyone who  is thinking about seeing an Alien Abductions Therapists, to read the book  first. It is a MUST READ 
 I first rented this movie in the 1980s from Blockbuster. It was so different, such a surprising delight, I watched it again about 10 years later. Different from anything I saw before or since.   I would like to see this on DVD, then I would purchase a copy. I discovered Sonia Braga in this movie. She was demure, then glowing with repressed eroticism, very sexy and then naked with her two husbands. Definitely not for those who cannot deal with open expressions of multidimensions of the sensual - music, samba, touch, dance, food, color, pastels, alleys, crooked walls etcetera.   Someone said it is amateurish etcetera. Definitely not 21st century production values, but it is a work of art. 
 Spiritual wisdom of the heart whose root is compassion. The Dalai Lama is so generous in sharing his thought process on why an expansion of love is valuable to everyone. Love heals in a way nothing else can. It is the force that turned around a Jewish zealot who arrested Christians from Saul to Disciple Paul on the road to Damascus, turned a tax collector into a Apostle, and conquered the once pagan Roman Empire into the Holy Sea. Buddhism has grown into popularity in the West as its approach to love concentrates on compassion to such a high extent that there can only be love left in its wake. A brilliant illumination on the nature of love. This book is for Buddhists and non-Buddhists. We are affected by the thoughts we expose ourselves to, in whatever media they appear, do your dharma and karma a universe of good .... and open your heart and head to the Dalai Lama's teachings on expanding love 
 This is one of the greatest classic in literature, the only downside is that it is a little long. You will really need some time to get through this one 
 Those who deny or attempt to "revise" the history of the holocaust like us to believe that there is a vast conspiracy. As Lipstadt shows in this book, they commonly discount evidence discordant with their views as the product of a vast conspiracy of Jews and their minions. Eye witnesses lied. Documents were forged. It was a conspiracy of Jews (unless the evidence confirms their viewpoint, and then they don't question its legitimacy!) So Lipstadt's book is an exercise in irony. It takes those who cry, "conspiracy," and shows that it is actually they, rather than those they accuse, of perpetrating a conspiracy.   Thus, let me stress at the outset that this book is not an attempt to historically rebut the 'revisionists.' (That has been done so many times it is sad!) This book is literally an attempt to expose those revisionists who claim neutrality ("I'm just interested in historical scholarship.") and shows their true motives.   Just like "intelligent design theorists" who are trying to inject a bit of old-time religion into biology by claiming the scientific impartiality of their God hypothesis, Holocuast revisionists have been bombarding the general public with a revamped, quasi-intellectual image designed to make them look credible. But, as Lipstadt shows through some serious detective work, hardly any (if any at all) of these 'thinkers' are neutral at all.   Some are smart but have ill motives (like Ernst Zundel, who has a very blatant history of being a neo-nazi). Others might not have ulterior motives, but practice shoddy scholarship (like Fred Leuchter, who's "scholarship" and credibility brought to nill here.) Otheres are both, like Arhtur Butz, who expresses much anti-Jewish sentiment, writes as a historian, but teaches only electrical engineering! Hmm.)  To be sure, this book is quite literally a two hundred page ad hominem attack. As mentioned, Lipstadt doesn't delve into very much historical debunking of these revisionists. This book attacks their character and (lack of) methodology. It is an attempt to show that, contrary to their protestations, these scholars are very little interested in objective historical truth. They are phonies at worst and neo-nazis operating under a lame subterfuge at best.   And this is why I deduct a star. As interesting as this book is, it is easy to see that Lipstadt has every bit as much of an agenda as do her subjects. She is just as passionate as they. And it is hard to see this book as always fighting fair: it is, after all, a continued attack not on deniers' history, but on their character. (And as others have pointed out, Lipstadt hypocritically chastizes these 'historians' for not having training in history, even though she holds no PhD in the subject either.)  Be that as it may, I can only deduct one star becasue as whiny as Lipstadt can occasionally be, her subjects deserve what they are getting here, as they play the character assault game as much, if not more, than she does. (Remember how historians and eye-witnesses are frequently dismissed in their work as biased towards the Jewish conspiracy!)  To close, I should note that a great companion work to this one - that does tackle the 'revisionist' history - is Richard Evans' "Hitler on Trial." For those who don't know, Evans served as a historian in defense of Lipstadt when she was sued by 'revisionist,' David Irving. He was charged with going through Irving's works and debunking them point by point, which he did easily and well. As shown is Lipstadt's subsequent book detailing the trial, Evans was unbiased going into the trial, and thus, cannot be accused of having motives other than accurate history. (He told Lipstadt that he would review Irving's work, but could not garauntee that his history was bad, until or unless he found evidence that it was.) Where Lipstadt's book takes on the motives, Evans' book is a fascinating look at their (mis)use of history.   Buy both. And if you want, buy some books by revisionists, but I think you will be wasting as much time as buying a book on biology by a theologian.   
 This is a great book overall on the topic of global warming. Flannery does a great job explaining the science behind global warming, and he also offers solutions for what we can do to stop it. Anyone who cares about the great Earth that we live on should read this book. Please do whatever you can to fight global warming before it's too late. 
 I am actually 28 but I bought this book as it was my favourite book as a child. It is such a lovely story and I would recommend it to all children (and parents) 
 ______________________________________________ The Strunk & White classic, in a classy new hardbound edition, with sprightly illustrations by Maira Kalman. The book designer is uncredited, more's the pity, since it's very nicely laid out.  Ten million customers can't be wrong, and millions of writers would write better by heeding these simple rules: Write clearly. Be brief. Never call a spade an agricultural implement. Revise, shorten, proofread! Sergeant Strunk snaps his orders to the recruits.  I've worn out a couple of copies of this. One could quibble with some of Sergeant Strunk's and Corporal White's marching orders, but considering that the junior author has been dead for twenty years, their little book is holding up remarkably well.  There are a number of complaints below about Amazon withholding samples of the art. So here are some: http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,0_1594200696_PSP,00.html?sym=PSP  Happy writing-- Peter D. Tillma 
 I have waited 33 years to read this book ... and 'Return to the Moon' has been well worth the wait!  Shortly after midnight on December 7, 1972, I witnessed the launch of Apollo 17 from the Kennedy Space Center.  It was an incredible sight -- one I will never forget.  It was also the last Apollo Moon Mission.  And one of the three astronauts atop that mighty Saturn V rocket was destined to become the first geologist to leave his footprints in the lunar soil.  As such, I have always wondered what Harrison H. Schmitt might write about his three -day field trip to the Valley of Taurus-Littrow.  But 'Return to the Moon' is not a look back at Schmitt's remarkable lunar voyage.  Rather, it is a careful examination of what scientists have learned about the Moon as a result of their studying the samples that Schmitt and the eleven other moonwalkers brought back to Earth.  Specifically, it describes the discovery of helium-3 in the lunar topsoil -- and the tremendous potential of that isotope as a fuel for fusion reactors.  In fact, as the title implies, 'Return to the Moon' is about the future!  Dr. Schmitt, who was also the only moonwalker to serve in the U.S. Senate, offers a detailed blueprint of why and how humankind should and can return to the Moon in order to utilize helium-3 in terrestrial powerplants -- providing a radiation-free, environment-friendly alternative to fossil fuels and fission reactors for the production of electricity.  As Neil Armstrong writes in his thoughtful foreword, "Dr. Schmitt builds his persuasive case with a plethora of detail."  Indeed, he does.  Schmitt covers not only the scientific aspects of the private sector enterprise he proposes in the book, but he also discusses the economic, managerial and geopolitical factors that would affect our 'Return to the Moon.'  This is a scientific book.  Yet, Dr. Schmitt writes clearly and concisely.  He appeals to the average reader, as well as to the more scientifically-inclined.  After all, he is trying to persuade the general public that a 'Return to the Moon' is both feasible and necessary.  Schmitt's visionary ideas are both fascinating and captivating.  I could not put the book down.  'Return to the Moon' is destined to become an instant classic.  Much as past generations were inspired by Jules Verne's fictional account of space travel, 'Return to the Moon' will inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and space explorers.  It is a 'must read' for anyone who believes in our future in space, as well as anyone who is concerned about our future on Earth.  Harrison Schmitt did not write another astronaut memoir.  Instead, he has given us something far more important.  He has provided us with a guidebook to the future.  Thank you, Dr. Schmitt.  It is obvious that humankind was well-served when you took your place aboard Apollo 17 and caught the 'last seat' to the Moon.  The manner in which you weaved the lessons of the past with the challenges of the future makes this book a real treasure.  
 The Discovery of Poetry is not only an excellent reference for various forms and styles, it is an excellent anthology for the person who has an interest in poetry, but who is unsure of what to buy.  If you could only afford to buy two books on poetry, this should be one of them 
 This record is amazing.  It is raw.  It is emotional.  It is Rock.  From the first track, 5-8-10, to Parking Lot, this is the standard for emo's heyday 
 Originally published in 1972, Saul Kripke's Naming and Necessity is a compilation of three lectures given by the author in January 1970 at Princeton University.  Aside from transcripts of the lectures (with minor editing), the text includes a brief preface and postscript (or agenda as Kripke calls it) with some helpful points of clarification.  Kripke is regarded by many as the pre-eminent philosopher of recent times- while Naming and Necessity is widely viewed as the most significant piece of post-Wittgenstein analytic philosophy.  In the book Kripke discussion of a range of issues and questions that has altered the trajectory of modern philosophy including:  *	Accidental and essential properties, *	Theories of reference (direct reference v. descriptivist) *	Epistemic and metaphysical necessity (he poses the possibility of necessary a posteriori truth and contingent a priori truth)  Readers unfamiliar (or rusty) with Kripke may find the pertinent chapters in Scott Soames' excellent Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 2: The Age of Meaning helpful in preparing to engage Naming and Necessity.  The small text `On Kripke' in the Wadsworth series is also useful and even more introductory.  Overall, this is an important work in analytic philosophy that would make a valuable addition to any collection.  As with much modern philosophy in the analytic tradition familiarity with the genre and subject matter is a perquisite to fully understanding and appreciating the discussion (that said this book has a nice flow).  My comments pertain to the 2005 reprint by Harvard.   
 Mr. Minter comes through again with a hard hitting reporting style that comes up with stories that aren't reported adequately elsewhere in the media. Taking investigative journalism to places that other pontificators only dream about Richard Minter tells more stories about the War On Terror that Americans need to read. In a style somewhere between Tom Clancy and Bill Gertz, Minter delivers style and prose that is easy on the brain, flowing and captivating. I was glued to the pages. It was an enjoyable read that provided a great perspective into many under-reported aspects of the war.  His bias leaks through as a conservative and hawkish but the prose doesn't come across as an ideologue. He backs his information up with interviews and facts and provides supportive information that I found to be entirely persuasive. The material is well researched and he presents an exceptional bibliography for further reading. This is a book that everyone should read, conservatives and democrats alike. Minter finds pieces and interviews that no one else has and this niche makes for great exploration of the subject materials at hand.  
 I actually bought this for my husband. He loves it, it  has a lot of great features. The only thing that we found was that you had to really wet the device in order to get it to read the heartrate. 
 Sawhney's album is one of the best sample-drum machine compilations I've ever heard. In a world where electronic music is a clone from CD to CD, Sawhney throws in very organic mixes that bring out the beauty of digital artistry. The album shows a very acoustic brilliance to 1's and 0's. Recommendation off this album: Track 8: Breathing Light 
  What makes this book so interesting is it's method of describing churh history by describing the hereseys the Christian faith has faced over the centuries. The focus is on theology and the development of doctrines, with political and historical events as a backdrop. This approach is refreshing especially for someone who is already familiar with the history of western civilization's events and characters.  The text is very well written and easy to follow, even for a laymen; however, theological nomenclature is a stretch for me. The author does a superb job in conveying the differences, some very slight and technical, in various theological doctrines, and shows how they exist, fade away, and sometimes reemerge under a new age moniker. It's interesting to see how modern man really isn't so modern after all.  I think the most beneficial lesson I take from this book is to understand how orthodoxy is in the original Scripture, and in the beliefs and practices of the Apostles. I am confident the early church fathers passed on the true gospel, and successive generations have defended it sufficiently to be able to discern orthodoxy from heresey. The conclusion that tradition is valid won't sit too well with those inclined toward heresy, no matter what the flavor, and resent being told that the truth is plain and commonly held, not an esoteric knowlege of an elect minority or a grand conspiracy.  An indirect benefit I gained from reading this book is some insight into why there is such distrust amoung some Christians of Alexandrian manuscripts, and Bible translations taken from them. This book shows where heresy tended to flourish in the old empire and where it was staunchly defended. It also shows the subtlety of false doctrine, in case your interested in the perspective of the invisible war.  Lastly, I'm left with the conviction that a simple person of simple faith who lives out the gospel is just as saved as a complicated theologian who spends his time contemplating the mysteries of God. 
 I saw this film a few years back on TV and really enjoyed it, but I notice it is presented in full screen format. Is this the correct aspect ratio? I hate to buy a botched pan/scan version....can anyone help me out?????? 
 Pretty good, but not as good as some of their earlier albums, in my opinion 
 Once again, Criterion does a classic movie justice.  The digital transfer is 100x better than previous versions available on dvd and the extras are strong, as usual 
 Although a pessimist could say that this is a low key ad for Dr. Whitaker's Wellness Institute, which in small part it is, the book provides a balanced view of just what causes heart disease and provides sobering thoughts on the fact that there is no "magic pill" or clear cut way to attack the problem.  Differing views are presented and the background for such, although not clearly articulated in the book itself, is provided via the references so that the reader can further explore if more details are desired.  The recipes section is somewhat of a waste of print but other than that I found the book very helpful in aiding in an understanding of heart disease and the array of possibilities for treating it.  The book also pretty clearly delineates between a "preventative" program and a "reversal" program, dependent on one's personal situation and goals 
 This book is absolutely peerless. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Tim Harrower presents the basics of newspaper design in a natural, informative, and entertaining manner. It's the type of book that, while each chapter may build on concepts in previous chapters, one can open up the book to any page and learn an important facet of layout and design. Whenever you open the book, you will learn something. The way Harrower presents his lessons, you have to be actively ignoring them not to be educated.  The negative comments about the spiral binding are completely off the mark. It's one of my favorite practical aspects of the book. You can sit down at your computer, open up the book to the lesson you need, and lay it flat down on the table or on a document stand. With standard binding, you would not be able to do this. The spiral binding is a conscious decision on the part of the publisher and author, and I'm sure it was made for this reason.  Every aspiring designer should read this seminal text; it is perfect for the entry- and intermediate-level layout artist. Tim is a great teacher with a good eye and keen sense for tasteful newspaper design 
 Nancy Wilson is pure class. Just listening to her simply puts a smile on my face and listening to this cd is no exception. The standout songs are: Save Your Love for Me, Happy Talk and Never Will I Marry. Ms. Wilson's vocals simply luminates 
 Fascinating book, I am reading it from cover to cover 
 I bought this cd in Febuary of this year because I wanted a good cd to listen to on a long car trip that I was going on.  I purchased this and Word of Mouf.  This cd is amazing.  The beats are awesome, but that is not even the best part.  In every song, Luda is off the freaking chain.  He flows so well throughout the whole album that it is almost unbelievable.  He also has an instantly recognizable voice and he has tons of punchlines in every song.  Each song has a great hook (something that Luda has become known for) and has funny lyrics.  My favorite song would have to be Game Got Switched, Phat Rabbit, or Southern Hospitality.  I highly recommend this cd to everyone because it is a dirty south classic 
 L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is one of the most riveting movies I have seen in years and was more than deserving of its Best Picture nomination (another one that bit the dust because of a sinking ship). The movie is really fast-paced and it is easy to miss things. Even after repeated viewings there are lines that you don't quite understand and clues here and there you don't pick up.  After reading the screenplay, everything comes together and one can find the missing pieces in this murder mystery modern film noir. An excellent screenplay to compliment an superb movie 
 The book is really good and well worth the money.New Zealand is a wonder to cycle thru, like Yosmite Valley on a nation scale. But be fore warned! Amazingly, the New Zealand roads are anti-cycle,and you put yourself there at your own risk. 99% of the roads are single lane on each side, they are very skinny lanes. Designed for small cars. Full sized transport semis use these roads with a clearance of inches on each side of their lane. .The roads twist and wind like mountain roads do. There are very few straight stretches of road as you  may see in the US. There are no bike lanes,few passing lanes, and no emergency lanes,you are in the path with traffic. Kiwis know their roads and consistently drive fast, 100-120kmph. The problem you are going to have over and over is cycling thru all this beauty in the same lane as cars and trucks...they barrel around a blind curve at 65mph  only to find you in front of their windshield going 15mph and no safety margin for anyone. On my recent trip there, I can't tell you how many times I saw this scenario played out and how many near misses I witnessed. Local drivers, particularly commercial tdrivers have real contempt for cyclists. Get the book and dream, but I think I'd look into renting a convertible and live to cycle another day 
 Very informative must read for anybody starting/working at an internet startup company 
 Matthew Bourne's rendition of swan lake was wonderful.  The movement of the swans was wonderfully birdlake yet still very graceful 
 I got this to use in my truck when I'm out in the country, going off road, or just need to find a new destination in the city. It has 2 points of adjustment so you will always be able to get it in just the right spot for you to see. also the suction cup works great. good product 
 I recently spent nine days in Prague, including a day and a half of a group tour, and about five full days of touring on my own.  I found all of the information in the guide to be accurate and up-to-date, and to be at an appropriate level of depth and detail.  I was able to prioritize and choose what I wanted to see, and get to everywhere.  The information on public transit (metro and trams) was very helpful.  I traveled to and through all the primary areas of interest without any additional maps or guidance.  Because I went with a group, the hotel was pre-selected (and not one that was in the guide), so I cannot comment on that aspect of the guide.  Others on our tour (which was a community college jazz band with several parents) had guides by other publishers, which by comparison we all agreed were markedly inferior to this guide.  Overall, this was an excellent guide, and I would definitely select DK's guides for my next trip 
 In this 300-page paperback you can find an overview of major areas of the law, from driving infractions to estate planning to the structure and rules of CA legal system. Most importantly, the book is written in a very simple and easy to undrestand language and has references to specific sections of the law if you want to go into details on your own. 
 Get the video. Great. I did not read the book but I can say the video, it is wonderful. Worth 6 Stars 
 This B+W folio contains 100s of photos and stories of the Appalachians, most written by the young adults who did the photography! It's a rare glimpse into family life in the hills! The photos are well done, and convey a sense of innocence and reality. The text is written on an adult level; interesting and relavant. This book has aged well, and is still representative of this locality. Worthwhile, very special, and rare with more than a touch of real magic 
 Bogle provides an excellent guide to the world of mutual funds. He begins with an introduction to three primary classes of investments namely stocks, bonds and cash reserves and goes on to provide an excellent insight into analysing and selecting a mutual fund. A must read for anyone who has invested or is planning to invest in mutual funds 
 Yes, it's warped! I feel like such an utter sociopathic evil human being for thinking this sick creation is completely hysterical. Oh, gosh, I mean, what's wrong with me that I break out laughing over what sounds in description the most demented thing ever drawn?  For those who may not know, The Gashlycrumb Tinies, by the legendary Edward Gorey, is a series of pen and ink illustrations that concern the ghastly, serial deaths of twenty-six small children (yes I feel awful just typing that knowing it's being read) all of whom have a name beginning with one consecutive letter of the alphabet, A,B, C, etc. and all of whom are depicted meeting singularly gruesome fates, each of the incidents set merrily to rhyme.  The children are Victorian or Edwardian, as are nearly all characters Gorey drew, and they meet their demises in astonishingly horrid ways. One is devoured by mice, another is eaten by bears. Another is sucked dry by a leech, yet another unfortunate meets her fate under a rug. One child even manages to perish from ennui!   Oh, dear Lord, this is insanity, and yet as penned by Gorey, this is so sick it's funny.  I'm stopping here.   Before anyone tracks me down to stone me at a crossroads under a full moon while chanting from the Book of Common Prayer, try reading this disgustingly hilarious little collection and see if you don't agree it reaches in and finds some twisted avenue in your soul and tickles till your inner sadist erupts with laughter.  I like children. I swear I do.  "M is for Maud who was swept out to sea..."  Help! I'm not a bad person for laughing, honestly! Sick! Sick! SICK 
    The only book I recommend. It is the best 
 This is a must have for any fan of Irish Literatur 
 I have read most of Sandra Hill's books.  She is very funny and I laugh out loud when reading her books.  In this book, she combines Vikings and Navy Seals.  It works 
 Except for 3 or 4 tracks this album is sick. I'm glad I bought it just for the exclusive technical itch track ...("The Real")which  samples a " Ready to die ? " from my favourite character the Merovingian just as an untertone to the industrial futuristic basslines and assasin like drums that Tech Itch is capable of producing. Other Tracks like " Hands around my throat" by  Death in Vegas , Free Land*'s "Big Wednesday" ,Junkie XL's "Beauty never fades" and Layo and Bushwackas "Blind Tiger" are also as a tekno fan a sublime pleasure of sound to the mind. For once the matrix producers had some good music backin up the visuals. Although I'm a big fan of the original matrix and reloaded ...lets admit it Revolutions sucked !!! The Animatrix with the original Matrix are together one of the best pieces of sci-fi ever thought up 
 I won't waste your time recounting the episodes. Instead, let's look at the execution:  Impressive visualization. Thin, precise lines, balancing straight (futuristic) against curved (human); nothing muddy. Carefully chosen colors, nothing garish, but nothing mundane. Lots of flat, one-color surfaces: no attempt to be realistic (face it: reality is dusty, dirty, messy). Style convincingly Americanizes anime.  Setting has some overtones of Akira or William Gibson's cyberpunk Tokyo, but hardly a slavish imitation, and no worship of futurific technology.  Stories are imaginative, well written, with a generous share of telling one-liners. Example: in "Dead Man's Hand," a society blonde protests being robbed of her jewels, and Jack, one of the robbers, comments, "She probably got them the old-fashioned way." That cruelty is acted out later when King, top dog of the outfit, slaps 10 across the face, drawing blood: this criminal family is bound together, finally, by greed and violence. The plot makes much of parallel relationships: 10's need for personal freedom brings her into conflict with her father, as does Terry's with Bruce.  Imaginative stories make for imaginative animation. To my mind, the best are the two Inque stories. The protean Inque lets the animators run wild, so to speak (rather like Jack Cole with Plasticman).  Voices (Will Friedle, Kevin Conroy, Stockard Channing) are superb, ditto the music. One of the DVD "Additional Features" is "Music of the Knight": five segments from four episodes, shown with music alone, no dialogue. A great idea--except that the music selections aren't mine. It would have been nice to have the option to turn off dialogue for the whole of each episode. Oh, well . . .  So what's the problem? The packaging sucks. It's thin cardboard with a single plastic mount inside. The cardboard slipcover is so tight that I have to open one end and push the contents out the other. (Cardboard doesn't suffer abuse nicely.) My plastic mounting piece was damaged some time before it got to me. Now one of the two discs is always sliding around inside the package or falling on the floor. I think I'll buy a used Brittany Spears double-decker, ditch the contents, and use the case as a replacement 
 I have been looking into many different brands and styles of cans, even the high end Sennheisers and AKGs.  Well with that said, even with experience with other more expensive headphones, I can honestly say that I am completely satisfied with these cans.  You get the sound clarity and bass, that may not be equal, but can compare to the higher end sound.  Aside from being a great sounding headphone, they also are very comfortable.  The light design and ergonomic ear area only contributes to the overall experience.  I have been wearing these for extended periods of time without any problems, and sometimes they're so comfortable that I forget that they're on!  To sum up, if you want a quality affodable package, go for these cans.  But if you have the money, go for the higher end headphones 
 and then there is everyone else.  In addition, this cd shows off his exceptional classical talents as well.  A terrific overview of his music.  I wish I could find some of his earlier cds too!  Simply the best!! 
 The Good Home is a Great Book!  More than that it is a motivating book.  You're probably thinking how does a book about architecture do this.  This book gets the reader to think about what the architect and author, Dennis Wedlick, is explaining then motivates the reader to expand on it.  You like his concepts and the thinking behind them yet he's telling you to take it further.  He's an expert who provokes not imposes a concept and then lets the reader take it higher.  Mr. Wedlick includes beautiful photographs of his finished products that mesmerize the reader and beg you to read on.  I highly recommend this book as both a learning tool and a new way to approach your idea of how to live 
   "Marvels" is a unique and refreshing look at the iconic moments in the Marvel universe as seen from the eyes of a dedicated New York City freelance photographer/aspiring writer.  It covers thirty years in its beautifully well drawn pages, from the emergence of the Human Torch to one of the defining moments in Spider Man's career, the one that comic enthusiasts lamented was not in the first Spider Man film because it helped shape Peter Parker as asuredly as the death of his uncle.    Be aware, however, that this is deliberately presented differently from most other superhero comics.  It takes a look at the little people, those regular humans who are surrounded by the heroes and whose lives are threatened--or merely delayed or inconvenienced--by the massive battles those heroes fight across the New York skyline.  "Marvels" also is written from deep research in the Marvel universe, and it not only skips around, but it also does not show (on the whole) the big, epic battles themselves, but rather the normal human's reaction to them, and the results of those battles.  Some people may be left feeling cold by this approach; but this is meant to be more than a retelling of those classic events, and if you are interested more in the conflicts themselves then you might want to stick with the original comics this is based on.    So, even though this work shares the amazing visuals of DC's "Kingdom Come" (both were painted by virtuoso Alex Ross), don't go in expecting a big brawl of all the Marvel Universe's biggest heroes, a la "Kingdom Come."  This is a different piece of work with a decidedly different story to tell and a much different message to get across.  Which is better?  Personally, I liked "Kingdom Come" a little more--Ross's art is more mature and the story is simply more epic.  However, "Marvels" is certainly unique and a welcome breath of fresh air for anyone who is tired of seeing superheroes only from the perspective of the heroes themselves.    Very much recommended.  Even those who only know a little about the Marvel universe will appreciate it, although those who are fully versed in all the lore will certainly get more out of it 
 Simply put, this was an outstanding book. If you are a guy then Vince Flynn's books are for you.  Lots of action with just a touch of romance.  You become very attached to the characters, epsically Rapp and Rieley.  In the Mitch Rapp series it is hard to put one book above any other and the third option stays true to all of that, very well written.  I am by no means the fastest reader around and being a soldier myself mt time can be at a primeium but I finished this book in two days, impossible to put down 
 Scotty Anderson - what else can you say...  This CD shows Scotty's abilities as a player and arranger.  Great playing !! 
 Please disregard my rating, as I have not yet read this title. I have however used An earlier work: The Northern School and the Formation of Early Ch'an Buddhism, quite extensively in the recent past. This is one of very few titles regarding a subject that certainly deserves more treatment. Especially in terms of more "academic" work/demystification. I am looking forward to reading this, as I have come to respect Mr. McRae's scholarship very much. I would  like information on Mr. McRae's website, as I am unable to locate it 
 I had to put in my 2cents too.  I have year after year of calendars and organizers that start off full and then... nada for the whole rest of the year..not this one.  It is very functional and I use it consistantly.  I am very excited to see Amy Knapp has a homeschool version so I'm going to check that one out right now.  Enjoy 
 ALL FINE, TODO MUY BIEN, TO MY CAMCORDER ELURA 100 IS OK, PARA MI FILMADORA ELURA 100 ES PERFECTO. 
 This collection of Malamud short stories features two very long stories, "The Silver Crown" which is about a young teacher's search for a miracle cure for a father dying of cancer, and 'Man in the Drawer ' which is about a visiting American writer's meeting with a Soviet writer who requests from him help in publication in his work. The title story 'Rembrandt's Hat' deals with the strange quarrel which develops between a scupltor and art critic when the latter comments on a new hat the sculptor has put on. In all these stories the Malamudean quite observation of inner moral dilemna is present. The humor, irony and complexity within human relationships are portrayed with a stunning exactitude. And the conclusions, the ends of the stories have a kind of difficult indefiniteness which often marks Malamud's ending.  
 Simply a great work overall.  Well worth the time spent watching it.  I've watched it 5 times and eventually bought the DVD too.  Loved the scenery.  Great cast of actors.  My only main objection was his love interest (Mary) which did not really fit her part (looks and mannerisms etc).  She tried hard and it came across okay, but her appearance (esp the hastily messed up "modern beauty shop" style hair - all well cut "even ends" - obviously modern styled underneath) detracted from her part (she did not look like a pioneer woman from that 1870s period or one that had been in an Indian tribe for a long period - acted too modern too) but rather she talked and looked like a woman from 2000s who sprayed her hair and then lamely attempted to make it messy looking like from the past).  She came across as a city woman trying too hard to be from the wild, esp her contrived broken speech (not believable).  She is better in Battlestar G as a future President.  My only minor objection to the movie was it had no sequel (Part 2 or 3) to show me what happened after this movie's end, to Kevin and the members of the tribe etc.  I felt I needed more movies, and also a better closure at its end to the close attachment I had gained while watching the movie. I was left hanging.  Again, overall, one great movie.  Buy it and watch it every year .. 
 I have one of Black and Decker scrub brushers.  Big brush is the same. But on this one they included an attachment to use the pads.  The motor is powerful but fast speed could go a little faster for me.  The pads are like plastic steel wool and really do the trick... cleans my tub in like 2 min without effort.  
 "Jason and the Argonauts" is a Ray Harryhausen fuelled adventure, in colour (1963) based on the Greek myth, full of stop motion monsters, intrigue, great locations and costumes. Like a lot of the Ray Harryhausen related DVDs, there's "The Harryhausen Chronicles" documentary added as a special feature (at least on the version of the DVD I watched), narrated by Leonard Nimoy and feauturing interviews with Ray Harryhausen, fans like Ray Bradbury and George Lucas, as well as rare stop motion footage Harryhausen never used in films. It's a great feature, a great documentary, a great package 
  Such blah,blah,blah reviews. The book is an excellent overview of the most popular how to psychic books. It gives a fair taste of other author's "how to" tips , which Friedland zealously credits and tells you how they worked for him. And if you'd want to read more on any point the authors he borrows from are referenced in the bibliography. For the price, one of the best "how tos" out there. You'll waste your money on a lot of other books by not buying this one. 
 This is a great movie, and the transfer was done well. James Garner and Julie Andrews at there best 
 Once upon a time in the Multiverse there was indeed a Fifth Elephant floating around aimlessly. He could not help it, but he crashed violently screaming and kicking into the Discworld, at the same time splitting continents and raising mountains. An eternity later his remains are still buried deep in the planes of Uberwalt, the home of vampires, werewolves and most importanly dwarves. Dwarves who are not only mining diamonds and gold, but lately also elephant fat. It is exactly that valuable asset that brings Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, to the conclusion that keeping good diplomatic relations with Uberwalt is maybe not such a bad idea. On the other side, sending Captain Vimes on such a diplomatic mission might not belong to that same pool of bright ideas.  It is always a great joy to meet the old folks of the City Watch again for another crazy voyage. This time it is not different: it all starts with Sergeant Colon's experiences with the Discworld version of a speed camera, but soon the complete City Watch proves that silliness is their strongest weapon. This time not many new characters are introduced, but this only means that known characters, such as the Igors and that cute little doggie Gaspode, get more attention.  The attentive reader certainly will notice the undertone that links certain forces in Uberwalt to a Nazi regime. Indeed references to sub-humans and other Nazi slogans are generously spread throughout the story. In this respect The Fifth Elephant is unique -at least for the Discworld series- in the way that it portraits a strong political message against extreme nationalism. In the end it is not only a funny, but also an extremely smart book 
 Lisa Johnson has managed to make this book a fun read while encouraging moms who are in "the trenches".  Her stories are ones all moms can relate to, appreciate, and laugh over!  No one else understands moms like other moms do - All moms will relish that feeling of being understood; Johnson shows us she possesss that great understanding through all her hilarious experiences.  At the end of the book I felt disappointed there were no more stories!  I look forward to a sequel 
 This a quick read that sums up the musical and lyrical genius that is Pet Sounds.  The author takes a diplomatic approach to the rocky relationship Brian had with the other Beach Boys (especially Mike Love), and focuses more on the music and technical aspects of the album rather than the lore surrounding Brian Wilson's problems and increasing demise.    For Beach Boys/Brian Wilson fans, the back story on Brian's life might seem redundant, but for newcomers to the Wilson story it does a good job of summing up what moulded him into the person he was and why he wanted to deviate from the Beach Boys formula and branch out, eventually producing Pet Sounds.  The book has excellent research, and it shows.  While lacking minute production details, it does a good job at bringing Wilson's studio innovation to life by describing the people he worked with as well as his adventurous studio methods. Wilson's quotes don't really shed much light on the subject, but the studio musicians of the album enlighten one to what it might have been like working with such an innovative genius at his peak.    This book gives Tony Asher just as much credit and copy as Wilson himself.  The author of the book actually seems just as interested in Asher's lyrics as he does Brian Wilson's music, preferring the songs of Asher to the traditional 'Sloop John B', which the author felt 'destroyed' the idea of Pet Sounds being a 'bona fide concept album'.  While the author's prejudice about the album lies in his personal liking for it, he does an overall objective job when it comes to presenting the content and actual  making of the album.    I recommend this book to anyone who would like to find out more about studio production techniques of the 1960s and collaborative songwriting 
 This novel is heartbreakingly amazing. Beautiful setting. Beautiful prose and plot, and all that implies. Too good.   Andrew Sean Greer is a poetic writer at best.  I can't wait for his upcoming book.    Max Tivoli is definitely recommended 
 Jerry Spinelli unfolds a basic story and sprinkles humor, love, detail, and a major life lesson. Fourth Grade Rats is a book about a ten-year-old named Suds who is in fourth grade. According to the rhyme, "First grade babies, second grade cats, third grade angels, fourth grade rats", he is now supposed to be a rat. However, it isn't like him that he should steal first and second graders Twinkies, throw them off the swings, say "no" to his mom, and mess up his room, but his best friend, Joey Peterson, thinks otherwise. He tells him to get rid of his flying elephant lunchbox, eat bologna sandwiches instead of peanut butter and jelly, and to steal Twinkies and kick little kids off swings. His love, Judy Billings, goes after Joey when a bee lands on his arm and stings him--and he doesn't even cry. The major life lesson is don't let anybody pressure you into doing anything you don't want to do. I loved this book because of its major life lesson, and its detail. I would recommend this book to anybody and everybody.  
 This is one of my favorite books. It's an intelligent and intricate thriller, well written, with a truly superb (and unique) plot. I highly recommend it. 
 The New York Times says Yoo was "a critical player in the Bush administration's legal response to the terrorist threat, and an influential advocate for the expansive claims of presidential authority that have been a hallmark of that response."  He argues that the President has broad powers in wartime to protect us from attack.  The book provides a lot of history and constitutional arguments to show it is true.  
 Sakoian's classic is still a useful book in my Astrology library...this book has aspects to the Nodes as well as to the Descendant and the Ic!  Published in 1989, perhaps this info has not been  improved upon...in fact,  most aspect books don't bother with these angles specifically. They use  "oppositions" only....adequate, but just! Great for  beginners,this is the Only Astrology book I loan friends when they want to  know more 
 A wonderful little book designed to help the owner of a newly 
 Put simply, this is the most sensual portrayal of the vampire myth in recent cinematic history, and it does a neat turnaround of the roles, since most renditions have a sweet, innocent young woman seduced by a dark, handsome bloodsucker.  Instead, Jenny Wright is the ethereally beautiful, seductive, mysterious stranger who initiates Adrian Pasdar (as farm boy Caleb Colton, whose openly displayed lust is kind of amusing for a minute there) into the mysteries of her night-focused world. Watch her during the scenes in which she bites Caleb -- and later, kills for him. Jenny Wright certainly never reached the caliber of Meryl Streep during her short career, but she COULD act. Her performance as Mae in "Near Dark" was chilling -- and admirable.  Caleb is on a sort of probationary vampire status, and he finds it impossible to kill (which is a requirement, since according to Mae, "The night has its price.") And yes, the end is probably not what the readers of Fangoria would have preferred, although they probably would've bailed on this anyway once they learned the only real gore was in the bar room scene.  Terrific supporting cast, especially Bill Paxton, who stole every scene he was in. But the scenes with just Wright and Pasdar -- oooh. Powerful, sexy, and unforgettable. Not to be missed.  
 Glenn Gould's name is invariably associated with firstly the Goldberg Variations, and secondly with his retirement from public performance. Here, however, we hear him playing the Goldbergs live, at the Salzburg Festival  in the late 1950s. The recording's sound quality is very good, and the  performance itself lies somewhere between the brazen race of the 1955  recording and the aged contemplation of the 1981. But the clarity of the  lines is unmistakably Gouldian, and anyone interested in Gould ought to own  this historical quirk, a live Goldbergs. The Inventions are also live but  unfortunately are severely let down by very poor sound quality 
 Anything by Dave Barry is genius - full of insight, uncannily funny, entertaining, and thought provoking.  Dave Barry Turns 50 makes a perfect small gift for 50th birthdays (as does Dave Barry Turns 40 for those a decade younger. 
 This collection is fantastic for reading to children, or for letting middle-schoolers read. It give a clear, readable form of each story, including Chinese terms to keep the Chinese flavor. I really loved it- and so do my little guys 
 The sound quality is nice rather than harsh like some metronomes.   It DOES have 2 sound levels built in; the adjustments are on the side. One is louder than the other which has a softer, sweeter quality. I can practice with my mute on or off and change the volume accordingly.  Using a Metronome: All of my violin students (children and adults) begin at number 60 on the dial. If the time signature says 4/4, each quarter note receives one beat and there are 4 beats per measure. They practice scales, exercises and all songs at 60 to begin with. Once they master everything at 60 they move the dial to a higher number. The following numbers are 63, 66, 69, 72, 76, 80, etc. (all the way to 208 on this metronome) Their goal is to play at 80 with no mistakes. Many students can play well at numbers higher than 80.      
 Before getting this CD, I knew nothing of the band 'Gratitude' and could draw no conclusions or comparisons. This band debuted with their album self titled and have made a decent entry into the pop-rock market. What a refreshing band with a full on pop rock sound, not to lite or too heavy or deep - in my opinion just right. I am glad I brought this CD and enjoyed the enhanced bits of this CD for the video clip of 'Drive Away' is great. I am in my mid 20's and I could not denote from this music that it was aimed at teenagers. I and my friends my age and older enjoyed listening to most of the songs with the highlights as I have said 'Drive Away', 'The Greatest Wonder', 'Sadie' and 'If Ever'.  Give this band a chance, you will find the San Francisco band refreshing and sounding great. 
 I first met this breathtakingly beautiful book several years ago while working at a beadstore. It was an absolute treasure trove of information while I was studying the history of beads and beadwork. The photos of historical and cultural projects are a wonderful source of inspiration and knowledge. The pull-out chart of the bead time line is beautiful. a beautiful coffee table book and useful reference 
 Often lauded as a 'film noir' classic it is not without good reason that Sunset Boulevard sits high within the list of greatest films ever made. An epic portrayl of the shallow fickleness that is Hollywood, it was (and still is) a cutting blow delivered by director, Billy Wilder to the world in which he operated.   The story of tragic diva, Norma Desmond's desperate attempt to cling to the life of adoration and fame that she once knew by believing in a world that still needed her, brutally depicted the truth of the 'monsters' that were being created by the 'Hollywood Machine'in the late forties.   The critique of the film's story line is supported by stunning cinematography, amazing lighting and some the greatest one liners ever commited to celuiod. Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is breathtakingly portrayed and still classed as a defining performance. Supporting cast and an amazing score go on to prove that while the special effects of today's digital age can make the unreal become true, a truely talented director, crew and cast can still make the real become untrue.   It is Desmond's desperation to believe that after twenty years her 'people' were still waiting in the dark and the pathetic way she desired struggling writer, Joe Gillis to 'love and need her'that gives a still relevantly stark insight as to how the wonder of the silver screen has a fatal side effect; an almost psychopathical requirement to be wanted.   Strangely enough though, even after fifty plus years there is still not a film that matches Sunset Boulevard for the bitter and unflattering truth that it portrays of the self obsessed world that is Hollywood. Perhaps not as many directors are as brave as Wilder to 'bite the hand that feeds them'     
 Great to include the Doobies' songs, but why the heck can't we get the full song, not these chopped versions? C'mon Rhino, I expected better from you. Best of had the same chopped #4 and #6 songs, not sure about #13.  4. Yah Mo B There - (single version, with James Ingram) 5. Takin' It To The Streets - (single version, with The Doobie Brothers) 6. Sweet Freedom - (single version) 13. Take It To Heart - (radio edit 
 Lillard's book is great first book for parents to read to learn the basic theories. It is very much a summary of Montessori methods and an answer to many of the criticism's of Montessori up to the 1970's. Lillard quotes Dr.  Montessori extensively, so much so that it seems that the reader is getting  the best pieces of Montessori's own writings in a nutshell.  The writing  style of both Lillard and Montessori is complex, but if you stick with it,  you will find great wisdom 
 Creative Stamping with Mixed Media Techniques is another valuable resource and creative inspiration book from Sherrill Kahn.  Both books by Ms. Kahn are full of outstanding photographs to inspired dozens of mixed media adventures.  Her work is bold and colorful, and incorporates numerous mixed media techniques that are easily accessible to all readers.  There are dozens of project ideas in the book that will satisfy crafters, and even more valuable are the demonstrations of painting and stamping techniques that readers can explore and adapt to their own artwork and projects 
 Enterprise Knowledge Portals is filled with important, "real-world" information and tools for any organization planning or deploying a knowledge management portal.  Heidi Collins documents case studies and a methodology with valuable questionnaires and planning models that will enhance any deployment.  If you already have a portal initiative, the book can help your organization move from a departmental portal to an enterprise portal solution... 
 I just picked this book up ata local antique book dealer. I have read and lived by his previous book " How to survive the Loss of a love". McWilliams words are soothing and have been a great comfort to me. No  matter what state of "love" you are in, there is a poem for you.  I know this one will be as dog earred as my other one 
 This book was actually fun. If you want something that doesn't require alot of thinking, unraveling, or deep thought, this is a quick, easy to follow, light, and fun story. A good diversion from some of the mundane books that's out there today. Enjoy it.   
 Unfortunately this was not my first VI book but fortunately I enjoyed "Killing Orders" and "Bitter Medicine" enough to look further.  I was not disappointed with the my reintroduction.   Ms. Warshawski is an appealing character to mystery readers, women, Chicagoans (?), and anyone who enjoys reading about a tough, intelligent woman rooting out the bad guys.  Not much of a mystery reader?  I don't really consider myself one and have enjoyed it immensly.  Give it a try 
 This is a very interesting book regarding the current scientific research on the biological and social causes of obesity and what society is doing about it (not that much). It covers a variety of topics such as what genomics research has discovered to date, the effect of prenatal nutrition on gene expression, and the rise in obesity rates throughout the world. The quality of the writing is excellent. The author uses a journalistic approach that makes the book very readable and gives you a feel for the personalities involved in the various aspects of obesity research. Good explanations from social, biological, and pharmacological perspectives are provided for why obesity is going to be a difficult problem to solve. The growing pandemic of obesity poses a global health problem that everyone should understand better. Reading this book is a good place to start 
 M is a wonderful piece of early sound cinema. It is Peter Lorre's first film and he portrays a chilling yet pathetic man who commits such heinous crimes. It is beautifully made by director Fritz Lang. Both Lorre and Lang would go on to make their mark in Hollywood film history.   The film is beautifully restored. After years of poor quality VHS releases, I found this DVd to be of very high quality. It is nice to finally see this film intact and the interview with Fritz Lang is a treat. This is a must for collectors of classic cinema. 
 Ellie Herman is a wonderful pilates instructor, and all of her books are well written and easy to follow. I use a lot of her tips in my pilates classes 
 	The book, Seven Habits for Highly Effective Families, is a remarkable book that can change the way your family dynamics work. If you have read Covey's greatest book, Seven habits of Highly effective People than you know the power contained within the pages. Covey is not the perfect example of a parent, but like all of us, is striving to reach a type of family "nirvana". 	 This book is full of precious information that you cannot afford to pass up. Covey touches on the seven habits that you and each of your family members can utilize in everyday interaction. Covey talks about the four human gifts, self awareness, conscience, imagination, and independent will. Covey explains how we can use these gifts to solve from the simplest to the most complex problems in our lives. He reiterates the bad trends that are attacking families in our modern age and how we as parents can guard ourselves and our families from falling victim.   	If you are struggling with relationships or looking to improve the relationships that you already have than read this book with your family, you won't regret it. 
 This is a great solution for people who want to have an always-on file server that is shared by multiple computers.  I think the performance is average for this kind of device, but if you only want to access the disk from a single computer, you'd be better of with a ESATA or USB drive which has much better performance.  Performance is especialy slow when you first access files, but I think might be due to the power savings features (the server is rated to consume only .6 amps).  Configuration is extremely easy with or without the supplied configuratin utility through a really simple web interface.   Documentation is minimal, but you don't really need it as long as you know that the default admin account is admin with no password (which I had to lookup online).  One note, that if I had to make this purchase again, I'd probably get the 250 GB instead of the 500 GB drive as I didn't realise how long it takes to copy and backup 500 GB of data onto a relatively slow server 
 From what I've read, it seems like a lot of readers bought this just for the King novella.  While King's short novella excellent, I highly recommend you read all the others, too.  There's a lot of good material in this big book 
 Excellent production. Typical Lanois sounscapes. I generally don't like too much cymbal crashing in my music, which explains some of my faves, P. Gabriel, K. Bush, and this fits in with that type of sound 
 Angela Bonavoglia has written an up to date view of the Catholic Church in the United States.  She has researched and interviewed wherever she could find Catholic women.  These Catholic women are enrgetic, hard working and faithful.  Faithful in the broadest sense of the word, followers of the good news to the outcasts of society and the good news of mutuality which Jesus preached.  Most importantly she brings the beauty of Catholicism into full view through her stories of the women in the Church. "Ah beauty, ever ancient, ever new..." Augustine wrote.  The new beauty of the Catholic Church is found in her women. Gaile M. Pohlhaus, Ph.D. Coordinator Villanova Theology Institute Villanova Universit 
 This is a favorite of ours. We already had the VHS but wanted the DVD. It is an outstanding film and ours came quickly and in great condition 
 This book is a little-known masterpiece. Lyrical, painful, beautifully (I should say "Beautyfully") written, and true to life 
 Ten stars.  This beautifully-written, handsomely-illustrated book is a must-read for all lovers of art, of any period.  Not only does Varnedoe illuminate the works of specific artists, traditions and eras, he proposes fresh ways of looking at and thinking about art.  Writing about Degas, he says, "This Realism doesn't describe a world, it proposes one."  Modern art makes the familiar look strange so that we may come to know it more fully - from a variety of perspectives.  Key to Varnedoe's argument is the contribution of the individual artist, whose innovations should not be reduced to a "cultural context" by later historians.  My favorite quote in the book comes not from Varnedoe but from the Russian Formalist Viktor Shklovski: "And ... so that stones may be stony, there exists what we call art."  A provocative and inspiring read 
 Dead Souls in number 11 in the Rebus series and for me it is one of the best. The plot has even more than usual going with 4 or 5 stories running concurrently with the main one. What makes this even more special is that all the plots are really interesting and don't feel like a distraction. One thing for fans of DS Siobhan Clark to note is that she barely appears in this book. I have only visited Scotland once and didn't stay very long but reading Rankin always makes feel like I am familiar with the streets of Edinburgh and talk with a broad Scottish accent.  I'm off now to re-read the whole series 
 This book covers such a variety of subjects and is so beautifully illustrated throughout with old-fashioned artwork.  From folklore to poetry, traditions to recipes, stories to songs, crafts to gift ideas; this book has it all!  I just love to browse its pages to put me in the Christmas mood. It would make the most wonderful gift. 
 I was at this concert, and it was a remarkable evening.  Though the selections on this CD are not every song performed that night (unfortunately missing are the two songs from "Carrie", one solo by guest Linzi Hately and one duet - not included I believe due to difficulty in keeping the singers and orchestra together while performing that difficult music live) - but what we do get is the essence of that evening, and these selections are excellent.  The album starts off much as the concert did, with a few standards and Broadway gems, some mellow, some sweet, but this is all just a warm up for what's coming.  By the time it gets to Mary Chapin Carpenter's "Come On, Come On" Betty is simply bewitching.  The painful memories of that song are painted with Betty's voice in a way that I think only she can acheive.  This is the song on the album I have played over and over.  Listen also to her medley of "Hi Lily Hi Lo/I Can Let Go Now" which spins the songs into a musical journey that Betty illuminates with shear beauty.  Equally magical is her verison of Billy Joel's "And So It Goes".  But if the ballads paint pictures of love lost and dealing with pain, Betty outstandingly secures her place at the top of the muscial theater with "Pirate Jenny", "Rose's Turn", "As If We Never Said Goodbye", and "With One Look".  Fierce, undaunted, at times almost pushed out of control - her voice rides these numbers from the low to the high, at every moment executing the difficulties of each song without fail.  For those of you who were not there, in the second half Betty sang 3 songs back to back and called it something like the "Musical Theater Monster's Medley" where she literally had the orchestra play a 60 second vamp while she changed costume, wig, and accessories in full view of the audience and then launched into each song (I know Rose's Turn and With One Look were two of them, but the third escapes me).  It was stunning then, and it will be stunning forever, since the evening was captured so beautifully on this CD 
 This is a great example what a benefit/relief effort is all about; people from all loctions focused on one goal.  Many genres of musical talent helping one key national crisis. A personal friend and favorite in the Arizona Music Scene is the great Jerry Lawson who teams with his new a capella venture, "Talk Of The Town" and the magnificent Rod Stewart on Curtis Mayfield's "People Get Ready".  
 I just finished this book, it is the third of Dickens novels that I have read. It is one of his shortest so it was easy to get through reading it in a decent amount of time. I enjoyed the characters he introduced, but I found myself getting a tad bit lost in some of his phraseology trying to figure out what was being said and understand exactly what was going on. Perhaps not everyone will enjoy this novel of Dickens, but the one thing I do like about Dickens is you can't breeze through any of his novels without putting some effort into concentrating on what is being said-or else you get lost! This being said, It isn't the most light hearted of his novels, but If you enjoy reading Dickens, you will most likely like reading this one, too, even if it isn't necessarily his best one.     
 I received this book in perfect condition as promised and received it in time.  I would order agai 
 There is no other book which so properly recounts reliable eyewitness testimony of this nature.  Even Hopkins' "Intruders" doesn't quite reach this level.  Mack's  "Abduction" has too many new-age  laced accounts.  The conclusions and theories of Strieber's  "Communion" *are* new-ageism, which he appears to now regret.   This is the one to get if you wish to hear accounts of level-headed  abductees who, I can guarantee, aren't going to turn around and say they  made it all up, as happened in the case of Mack's 
 I have loved this movie for many, many years.  The giant ants were pretty good for those early days of animatronics.  I love the old black and white Sci-Fi movies from the 30's, 40's, 50's and early 60's but this is one of my favorites.  It is one of James Arness' early sci-fi movies.    bl 
 This is a short review to say just how much I'm enjoying the motion picture soundtrack to The Lake House.  Though I now seem to be watching the DVD of The Lake House at least once every week, I'm listening to the musical soundtrack everyday.  I wish Rosemary Clooney's song, There Will Never Be Another You, was on the CD, as well as the instrumental music that was played when Alex plants the tree in from of Kate's future apartment complex in Chicago.  Still, this is a great CD with music that brings back the most wonderful memories of the movie.  In my opinion, this is what movie music is supposed to do.  A really good soundtrack has to be able to stand on its own, and The Lake House does with flying colors.  If you enjoyed the film, then you'll love having the CD to listen to.  
 Everything on a waffle is about a girl named Primrose whose parents were swept into a storm. One day her dad went out fishing and a terrible storm arose.  Her mom left her at her neighbors to go find her father who she never saw again or her mother. This story is mainly about her trying to find her parents which she does not give up hope. She lived about two years with her neighbor. Then she moved to her uncle Jack house that is always out selling homes so he never spends time with her.  She comes across a friend and spends time with her and not her uncle. This story is full of adventure and mystery.   I think if you like fun and interesting people read this book because I think it was great. I would compare this book to Chasing Vermeer because there is a mystery too. Over all this book is very exciting and fun.          
 Exceptional book on many levels.  James Guttman finds a way to expose all the "Insanity" of wrestling and does so in with humor.  I really enjoyed both the behind the scenes tidbits and the writing style.  
 Although it's not Christmas, I enjoyed this Christmas mystery, as I have enjoyed all the books so far in this series aimed at dog fanciers everywhere.  This was an excellent story, as well as a chance to see Rowdy and Kimi again.  I am getting quite fond of Rowdy and Kimi.  The book is about disaappearances and an "anal retentive" vet.  Steve has finally given in to Lorraine and accepted that he requires another vet to help run his burgeoning practice.  So Lorraine hires a new vet and he and his wife come to Cambridge.  Althought the vet seemes competent, Holly has a few misgivings.  The book is a little different as no bodies turn up, but that doesn't spoil the mystery.  This is a very enjoyable series, and I can't wait to read the next one 
  	This is the Hong Kong action/crime film that kick started the flagging careers of director John Woo and actor Chow Yun Fat. Prior to this, both were relatively small players in the Hong Kong New Wave, Woo at one point was even seconded to Taiwan to direct desultory comedies and romances, similarly Chow was hardly box office gold. The success of the film lies in its energetic synthesis of local allegorical concerns (the 1997 handover to China, and urban dystopia), its aesthetic merits (Woo's balletic, beautifully composed action sequences) and its referential attitude to western forms (the French new wave, the Hollywood action film.) This potentially unwieldy and fragmented fabric to the film is masterfully controlled by a director and cast who rise wonderfully to the hyper-kinetic challenge of the film. "A Better Tomorrow" single-handedly created a new generic hybrid known as "the hero" film, as well as presenting action in a new and innovatively edited way, the film also weaves in a nostalgic subtext which endeared it to local audiences. The themes of friendship, loyalty, forgiveness and reconciliation are strong in the film, especially in the light of the familial and institutional breakdown that the films protagonists are surrounded by. The themes of social and urban dissolution are taken to further extremes in later films, most notable "Hard Boiled". One could argue that Woo made more polished later examples of "the hero" film, but for me "A Better Tomorrow" has a special original quality of its own, which has been remarkably popular in the global exchange of filmic images.  Anchor Bay's DVD is devoid of the special features one has become accustomed to from this fine company, however slight compensation is made by the picture and sound restoration. A definitive release of this Hong Kong classic is still required. 
 Are they the best no.. Do they impress people who havent hear them before YES!! To me thats the best compliment, they are much more objective listeners with no preconcived notions. All I ever hear is " Those speakers sound so Good" " I love those cool little speakers" etc. I've played everything from Bach to Dio and they sound very realistic. Subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level. At [...] they are a steal.. I paid [...]in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new. 
 I'm too young to have any personal memories of Hogan, but Coyne does a superb job of bringing him to life.  I have never read a more compelling description of 9 holes of golf competition.  I also  learned some things about the early years of the tour, like the Calcuttas held prior to each event where patrons bet on their favorite competitor 
 Most comprehensive book on the topic I've seen. Very practical info. I interned with a small consulting firm that did excellent facilitation work, but their only training strategy for facilitation was "watch what I do and then do it" -- no real framework for a beginner. I wish I had known about this book; it put it all into logical structure and process, and allowed me to make sense of what I had seen a few times as a beginner. I've used its many practical checklists to become a respected facilitator, and still improving thanks to this manual 
 I read the book "The Da Vinci Code" and found it to be extremely disturbing.  In fact I was furious after completing it. I kept saying "Where lies the truth in this book"? Did someone jump of the train too soon?  Then fortunately for me, a friend informed me that your book was being written. For that I say thank you.  You do an excellent job of dispelling a number of innaccuracies while empowering the readers to validate the "facts".  Though the  Da Vinci Code is a work of FICTION, it is written in a fashion in which it may lead to the clouding of the senses!  I half expected your book to be a "preachy" rhetoric but it was by far anything but.  So my thanks goes out to you for putting a fresh perspective out there for readers to enjoy and to provoke thought so that they too will seek the TRUTH.  Sincerely,  Wm. Quinone 
 I really wish I could give this book 5 stars. The subject matter is fascinating, the science writing is brilliant [among the best I've read, and I read thousands of pages of science journalism every year], the main character is, at least on the page, a tornado of charisma and curiosity... But the story is that this intellectual dervish, Luca Turin, the titular Emperor of Scent, is a sort of Gallileo, whose patently true theory of scent [we are hand-led to believe] is spurned by the Orthodox Establishment who stand to lose money and reputation... but the establishment theory is never really examined.  This is journalism with a gaping hole in it:  the rebuttal never comes.  This is by no means Chandler Burr's fault.  As he describes it, Turin's theory is so revolutionary and so inconvenient that he can't even get the Old Guard to respond or rebutt.  He was stonewalled.  I tend to believe Burr's account, familiar as I am with his writing for the Atlantic, etc., but it is a flaw in the story nonetheless.  That said, this book is totally worth your time.  The writing is hyper-lucid and vivacious. Sparkling, really.  Burr's intelligence brings Turin to life, and leaves us a character worthy of great fiction.  How he does this with such transparent and seemingly effortless prose I have no idea.  Outstanding writing.  And, at least within the limitations he could not avoid, Burr has done some top-notch journalism.  If that rebuttal were included, I think we'd have a classic of science journalism right up there with John McPhee and David Quamen.   Great fun, and highly informative.  I look forward to the conclusion of the great smell debate 
 nice CD cool beats songs like Welcome To Atlanta pick it u 
 I found that book absolutely interesting even if I did not give much credit to the spiritual experiences of the author. Although I think Paul Brunton has invented some of the content, I admire his talent of writer. He  has a great imagination and his book gave me many hours of pure pleasure.  The way he describes atmospheres is worth buying the book 
 I thought Betta acted exactly how I would act if I were in her situation. Those reviews that said "no one's husband is perfect" just might be mistaken. For some, perfection can be found in love! I have not read all of Berg's books to date but I have found the endings of those I have read to be rushed and somewhat incomplete. Still, it is Berg's incredible story telling, replete with all its luscious imagery, that makes me such a fan of hers. I recommend this book wholly to any reader not yet a Berg follower. Then, I recommend What We Keep 
 This was my first Jodi Picoult book and still my favorite. I love her writing style. The way she switches between characters keeps it interesting. A real surprise ending, dont read the end and ruin it for yourself 
 This book is very comprehensive and the recipes are excellent.  I especially like the fact that modifications are presented for the american kitchen.  She also gives variations for various recipes (for substitution, or quick version) which is helpful. This book is certainly not for a beginner cook.  But if you know basic techniques and can follow recipes you will have great success at making excellent Indian food at home.  
 another cd that people may complain about all songs sounding the same, but that's what i like about it.  submersed has a great sound to them--great musically and lyrically!  i bought their cd not having ever heard of them before.  i was relatively impressed.  not the best cd ever by no means, but one you can pop into your cd player and play continuously.  not all of their songs are great, but the bad ones are actually tolerable.  if you're in the mood for a "new genre" band then i recommend buying submersed's 'in due time'.  
 This has to be one of my favorite YNQ albums. although there are only four this one stands out to me. it had a special feel to it. for me at least. Weldon Irvine did a fantastic job inspiring Madlib. which is the theme of this album. its a tribute to weldon irvine but the songs arent covers but songs that were inspired by weldons work. 
 I like this book and re-read it occasionally.  The reviews with individuals are helpful in gettin a semi-diverse opinion of the troubles of our world.  Some interviews are definately better than others so do not expect all interviews to blow you away.  I have marked 10 or so and come back to these occasionally in order to re-inspire myself.

 Dancing Longer, Dancing Stronger is for anyone who desires to understand their body and how to make it work more  effectively.  Along with detailed anatomical descriptions  of all the bones and muscles in the body and how they   interact, are exercises for both strengthening and   lengthening each muscle set.    You don't have devote a fortune in expensive equipment  or a large amount of time doing repetive, boring movement.     Suggestions in  the Question and Answer sections help you define your  structural weaknesses and suggest exercises within the   program for overcoming them.  Plus you never have to count  past 8!  Each exercise is done to one of four  8 count rhythms with most exercises being either  4 or 8 reptitions each.    As a figure skater, this book has provided me  with the best off-ice training I've found to date.    Even my coach wants a copy 
 The Franny story is a scary account of someone coming unhinged made even more disturbing by her youth. Like Salinger's other two-tale collection, one feels like a real story with arc and all. The other seems unformed - rewarding nevertheless, but demanding of the reader's full attention 
 makes you think. i wish he had made the point even more toward accepting Christ than he did 
 WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL STEAMERS BUT THIS ONE TOPS THEM ALL OF EASE OF USE, QUIETNESS AND FOOD PREPERATION.  IT IS THE QUIETNESS AND IMMEDIATE STEAM (WITHIN 30 SECONDS FROM TURNING IT ON)THAT MAKE THIS PRODUCT SO SUPERIOR.  I PREFER TO USE DISTILLED WATER TO PROLONG THE LIFE OF THE HEATING COIL - BUT - AT THIS PRICE - I WOULD CERTAINLY PURCHASE ANOTHER OSTER WITH SIMILAR RELIABLITY AND FEATURES 
 A few years ago I wrote a research paper for a college class in the psychology of personality. I read extensively from the literature on men at midlife and this book by Farrell and Rosenberg stood out for it's  sensitive, penetrating and revealing portrait of what can be a difficult  time in the lives of American men. Though a work of research backed by  numerical data, this is a book that is readable cover to cover. The authors  not only look unsparingly at the demands that our society makes on males  but also thoroughly review the different schools of thought on maturation  and put these to the test. They find actual "crisis" at midlife  to be uncommon but describe a denial of the true self as the rule for a  majority of men. Also related is the difference that class makes in the  likelihood of satisfaction at midlife. This book is the standard by which I  would compare any work on male midlife and I can't recommend it too highly 
 I am in the group that's grown frustrated with the pace of Jordan's last 5 Wheel of Time books.  So, it was with some trepidation that I bought this book.  What a pleasant surprise; it was a pleasure read, the characters were well developed, and the plot was defined.  I was emotionally involved in the book through the last page.  At 330 pages, it's a short story by Jordan's standards.  The plotline was intricate, yet easy to follow.  More importantly, it was resolved at the end of the book.   Nonetheless, there are plenty of threads that leave room for Jordan to write prequel sequels.   For anybody who's already read Jordan, I reccommend this book - you'll be satisfied.  If you're new to the WOT series, start at Volume One and read the first five or six books before you get back to this prequel. 
 My five stars are for the novel itself - and undisputed masterpiece. In this note I just want to report that I have been checking out this translation against the one in the handsome little Konemann edition - that is, checking each against the French. The Shaw (Penguin) translation is ever so much better than the other (by E. P. Robins). The general level of the English in the Robins is low, and it contais many out-and-out errors in how it renders the French. The Shaw, though imperfect, is much better 
 This is a great, intelligently written, informative and inspiring book: among the best cookbooks we own. 
 Surprisingly, for its small size, there was  lot of information packed into this book. There's nothing much to say about the book since it's an encyclopedia, but the quality is excellent. There are tons of color photographs, and they're all very enlightening. Also, the explanations are kept at a simple minimum, and are extremely easy to understand. It is a good book for all interested in all things occult 
 I also read the other reviews before buying...I'm glad that I did! I also had problems with the sides, but I realized that I didn't have the shelves on correctly. Incidentally, I purchased a second one at Toys R Us because I liked it so well. I would highly recommend this for anyone that needs nice looking, well made storage space. 
 This classic by A. W. Tozer is so powerful that you can't keep it to yourself. You do not want someone with whom you are close to miss out on the spiritual gems in this book. I am buying several copies to give to my friends. Tozer's deep spiritual insights cause you to look into the mirror of your heart while filling that same heart with an insatiable hunger for the relationship with God that He so desires for you 
 Maniac Magee is about a  12 year old boy whose parents where killed in a car crash at the age of three.  He was sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle that really do not like each other to the point they have 2 of everything.  They argued all the time, one night at his play they started yelling at each other so he decided to run away.    Maniac Magee ran away to a a town called Two Mills that was divided by race.  The white people lived on the east side and the black families lived on the west side.  This is where he meets a black girl Amanda. One day she had a bag full of books and Maniac asked her for one book to read.  When he returned the book Amanda's family they found out that he had no where to live so the Bealle family invited him to stay with them.  He ran away from there because of the racial comments and situations the Bealle family had to hear.  The Bealle family treid to help convince him that you should not always run away you should face situations.  Maniac Magee faced problems his whole life.  Ms. Bealle suggested to him to go and try to untie a knot that no one else has been able to untie.  When he did people started seeing him as a person and not a white kid.  When Maniac Magee runs away from the Bealle family he finds a white family to live with that has no rules and are very unstable.  He stays there to help the two younger boys to understand how important it is to stay in school.  Maniac Magee continued going back and forth to the east and then to the west side over and over.  This book shows us how racism is in our world to a point.  It is hard to seperate people from who they are instead of what they appear to be.  Maniac Magee over came the racism issues in Two Mills by seeing how each family of two different colors have issues and they are more alike then what they think.  I would recommend this book to all my friends.  
  I would recommend this book to any couple experiencing trouble in their relationship.  There is a lot of information that helps a couple to understand why they are having problems, and to help them to stop blaming one another.  There are lots of exercises included to assist you.  I am a therapist, and I use this book with many of the couples I see.  I continue to buy this book because I have "loaned" it to so many people 
 Great book. It was like watching a smooth running documentary about Iran filmed through hidden cameras inside an array of Iranian homes; some that even I (who was born in Iran) would not have personal access to. As they ranged from the very religious homes to the belligerently secular. While the writer like a wise uncle gives you relevant info about Iran's history and culture etc.   And I liked the fact that I can write and communicate with these bloggers through their email addresses. I also have to admit that it's the first ever book that I've read on Iran (even this was a present from my mum). So perhaps I am not a good judge of books, but it's made me want to learn more about my birth country.  
 the funniest heart warming movie i have seen in a long time. with so many serious things in the world now, just watch this movie and bust a gut laughing. good actors, superb story line 
 I recommend this CD for any one who loves the rawest, most aggressive riot grrrl acts such as Babes In Toyland and Hole (circa their debut album Pretty On The Inside) and Jack Off Jill's first album Sexless Demons And Scars.   It's certainly not an album for the faint hearted. Lots of screaming and like i said, just pure, raw, teenage girl aggression. I am a die hard Jack Off Jill fan and this is by far my favourite Jack Off Jill album. Sometimes the earlier studd is the best.  
 Fantasia is the all-time classic animated movie. Where to begin with this one? The animation is incredible, with stunning artwork, effects, and a huge palet of colors. The storytelling is top-notch, with excellent pacing and story development. Using classical music as a storytelling tool is A LOT harder than you may think, and the Disney animators pulled it off brilliantly. Each segment of Fantasia is its own self-contained movie, and each one is a winner. Even the weakest segment (the first one) is still an outstanding example of innovation (jawdropping for the 1940's). Other than the first segment, all stand up perfectly to repeated viewings. Fantasia is an AMAZING movie, which will entertain adults as much as children (a rarity). It is fitting in an ironic way, then, that Fantasia was also Disney's biggest flop when it was released in 1940. Oftentimes truly outstanding works take many years to be be recognized as the masterpieces they are (Wizard Of Oz, Its A Wonderful Life).     As far as the editing goes, I would like to address the Deems Taylor issue (he was the original narrator). The Disney people HAD to redub Taylor's voice, because a lot of the original recordings were LOST. NONE of the VHS or movie re-edits since the original 1940 release contained the missing narration. As they had only PART of Deems recorded narration, but ALL of the footage of Deems, they decided to redub the whole narration for continuity's sake. A tough decision, but an understandable one. The editing in the pastoral sequence is tougher to defend. Editing out a 1940's era stereotypical black servant is the PC way to do things, but is pretending it never happened a smart thing to do? Seeing the movie blemishes and all would send a better message, and a reminder that we have advanced a bit since 1940. However, I can completely understand Disney's editing. In this sickenly politically correct era, if Disney had released Fantasia unedited, they would be boycotted and labelled racists by a bunch of idiotic mental midgets who can't fathom the simple concept that viewing the material doesn't mean you agree with what it represents. HIDING THE MATERIAL DOESN'T MEAN IT DIDN'T EXIST, and that is something those same mental midgets will never understand (and they don't want to).     Anyone who can appreciate true art in any form MUST view Fantasia at least once in their life. This pinnacle of Disney creativity will most likely never be topped, and stands as cinema's greatest animated feature of all time.     HIGHLY RECCOMENDED 
 I enjoyed the book, I like the suspense, the connection with the characters, I enjoyed James Patterson suspense novels in the way he writes them and how the characters have their own identity and pesonaility 
 Coetzee is a South African writer who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 (not for this book); the first author to win two Booker prizes, and is known for his novels that look at race issues. This novel is a retelling of Robinson Crusoe as an "archetypal postmodern" novel. It operates on many levels and there have been 100s (1000s?) of academic journal musings written about it's many allegorical, literary and philosophical permutations about race, colonialism, feminism, creativity. I found it to be in such rarefied air that it was a blockage to an enjoyable story. For a didactic novel it is gold 
 By chance I came upon Traven at the library when I noted that he had authored "Treasure of Sierra Madre," a film classic that I automatically associate with Hollywood's old Bogey.    Not knowing anything more than that I picked-up "The Bridge in the Jungle,"  and what I found most fascinating was finding a story that so honestly stripped away cultural biases and opened a window to another universe. It revealed the dignity of a community dealing with death of a young boy in an obscure jungle town in early nineteenth century Mexico, and it also provided a vivid account of a proud Aztec culture on the threshold of extinction.    I wish I could see more modern American writers, who, like Traven,  would more readily examine how cultural biases skew our understanding and appreciation of the quiltwork of cultures that inhabit our amazing World.  
 The expression on the faces of my three and five year old as they puzzle, smile and nod over the adventures of Frog and Toad is something I think I'll carry with me for a long time. The kids are fully engaged with the audio CD, and can now follow along with the printed words when I read the same stories to them from the Frog and Toad books.   While Arnold Lobel has a calm, kid friendly reading voice, he never panders or talks down to the kids. I like that. I also appreciate the gentle, absurd wit that Lobel weaves into these stories. I'm not kidding when I say that I could see the skeleton of a Seinfeld plot in some of these stories. Makes it easier for an adult in the car to listen to, that's for sure.

 A quick read, a collection of short, fast-paced Stephen King stories.  Some of them were scary, some were funny, some were alarming, and some were disgusting.  If you're a fan of the horror genre, I think you'll get a kick out of this book.  Some of the ideas Stephen King presents are absurd, but that's what makes it so good.  Stephen King is the master of horror, and this is yet another successful book of his 
 When I was assigned this book for summer reading I didn't think anything more about it than any other book on the list, but once I found out what it was about I was hooked. the story is truly inspirational and intriguing. I was surprised to find my own grandfather had worked at the south pole station, though not the same one and knew a bit about what the boook described. It is struly a book that will grab your attention and make you desire to know how Jerrie is doing today.  ~ an enthusiastic fan 
 This was truly an enjoyable book. You don't have to read it from front to back. It's filled with inspiration stories that help put things in perspective. Faith is truly a powerful tool and Swami Rama's stories show just how having faith can help you get through tough times 
 A little thick at times, but for those interested in the key issues and research that surround TBLT then you must buy this book! A very important book 
 It is hard to say anything about this album that has not already been said a dozen times, but some things are worth repetition.  This album was my first exposure to Godspeed You! Black Emperor (referred to from now on as GY!BE), and I really had no idea what to expect. The monologue at the beginning of the first track immediately grabs your attention and says one thing very, very clearly: "This is NOT just another record. I have something to say, and you're going to listen."  GY!BE don't make music, in the traditional sense of the word. They are landscape artists, but instead of paint and brushes, they use guitars and drums (and a surprisingly varied assortment of other instruments) to do their creating.  The message is clearly not a hopeful one. "We are trapped in the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death" the old man laments at the beginning of the record. This is, as has been said before, the soundtrack to the end of the world.  As trite as it sounds, the image of London presented in 28 days later while east Hastings is playing is an almost perfect representation of the soundscape that GY!BE create in this album. To listen to this album is to feel the despair of one knowing nothing will ever be whole again.   Somehow, GY!BE have managed to create this horrible image and still have it be beautiful. The music itself is a thing of beauty, the message it conveys is one of ultimate despair. There is something magical in the dichotomy, and I doubt it could be pulled off by any band without a true gift for music.  Also striking on this album are the pauses, which seem to go on interminably, especially on the last track. But somehow, just when it's gotten to the point when the silence has started to annoy you, music comes back in, flooding your newly virginized ears with its wonder.  To me, there is a sound in that silence, but it can only be heard if one listens painstakingly closely. It is a sound heard all too infrequently in the past few years. That sound, my friends, is talent...and I think we could all use to hear a bit more of that 
 I am a serious christian and I LOVE how in alot of his books he says "christ" and "jesus!" ALOT!!!  WAR JESUS!! 
 Not a typical no brainer movie.  This movie presents complex people with complex motives.  Topher Grace is effective as the successful executive who can impress top ranking executives, yet has an undeveloped personality in many ways.  He is still trying to find out who he is and what he wants in life.  This lack of maturity and goals costs him his wife.  He focuses on his job even though he isn't passionate about the work.  Quaid does not like his demotion, yet he tries to be fair to his new boss and doesn't try to sabatoge him. This is where the film differs from other, inferior movies.  He is unhappy about his new status but tries to make the best of it.  He even tries to help his new boss.  The love story is played with honesty since Quaid's daughter is too young to commit hereself to anyone, yet she's attracted to her dad's new boss.  Don't expect cheap laughs and simple answers 
 I bought this book because we found the WDW version to be very helpful. This was not as comprehensive, but still had more information than any other book we have found. They have excellent ideas for touring the parks which can save lots of time. You don't have to follow the touring plans step by step to benefit from them. If you follow their suggesion you should have a very magical vacation 
 Lynda Obst uses her experience as an accomplished film producer to explain to new people how to make it in Hollywood.  She hits every topic right on the head.  I have experienced the same things in getting my films made, particularly The Indie Pendant.  All of her info can used by anyone wanting to become a filmmaker.  The chapter on figuring out which way the horse is headed was probably the best chapter I have ever read on getting things done in Hollywood.  Look for all of this info and more during The Indie Film Hour on World Talk Radio. Hosted by myself.  www.vdefilms.co 
 When the atomic bomb dropped at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, Hiroshima was a thriving city of two hundred forty-five thousand people.  By 8:20, one hundred thousand of those people were dead.  Combining the broad perspective of the absolute devastation of the city with the tiniest details of six individual lives, John Hersey provides a powerful closeup of a few survivors of the atomic attack on Hiroshima, giving the carnage a human perspective.    Focusing on  Mr. Tanimoto, a Methodist pastor; Mrs. Nakamura, the widow of a tailor, and her three children;  Dr. Masakazu Fujii, a physician in a private clinic; Fr. Wilhelm Kleinsorge, S. J, a priest in a Catholic mission; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon at the Red Cross Hospital; and Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in a tin works, as they survive the initial attack,  the author follows their daily movements, their subsequent illnesses, their fears, and the eventual outcomes of their lives.  The victims become human, and their concerns become universal, as Hersey shows them digging themselves out and helping their neighbors, filled with an "elated community spirit" in the days and weeks after the bombing.  Details of the fires following the bombing, the unexpected radiation sickness, the mysteries surrounding the kind of bomb this was (some Japanese believed that the allies had sprinkled powdered magnesium over the city and then ignited it), the devastating rains that followed, and the monumental scale of the damage are presented in straightforward, factual style, the horrors of the reality so overwhelming that Hersey had no need to try to control his narrative by selecting details or ordering them for effect.  Published in the New Yorker in August, 1946, this anniversary remembrance had immediate and dramatic repercussions, perhaps because the focus on "ordinary" Japanese citizens, much like the Americans who read the article, as opposed to "the enemy," resonated with his readers.  Thousands listened to four days of its reading on ABC radio, and many others bought the New Yorker to read his account.  By raising also the question of the ethics of dropping such a bomb (which some of the Japanese agree was acceptable as a normal part of the war), he also forces his readers to consider the long-term implications of atomic warfare.  Dramatic, powerful, and very personal, this account of six lives, changed forever, is a monument to the human spirit in the face of incredible adversity. n Mary Whipple 
 Mel Brooks is one of those things that makes life worth living, and this is him at his best.  And that Carl Reiner ain't half bad, neither.  A bargain at any price 
 Man its amazing to see these guys and the way you seem them on the TV is the same way you seem in the street, "real."  Support Hip-hop as it's laying on the its death bed.  One for all is my fav track (video version). 
 I full concur with Greenberg's review. Assimilating Potter's book is also much easier if one has had a prior introduction to mathematical logic and axiomatic set theory.  Potter sets out an axiomatic set theory he calls ZU, whose axioms are: there is a ground level of sets, every level has a successor level, Infinity, and Reflection (a schema). These axioms are a perspicuous embodiment of the iterative conception of sets and the related hierarchical ontology. Potter then shows that these axioms achieve, in a fairly relaxed way, all we would want these axioms to achieve. This theory should be given an important place at the high table of foundational mathematics.  Set theory is inherently philosophical because its true subject matter is patterns in the human mind and human sensory experience (in this respect, I concur with Lakoff and Nunez). Potter is a bracing philosophical read, but be aware that there is a good deal more to the philosophy of set theory and foundational math than he lets on. His ample bibliography nicely shows the way to more reading in this vein.  Some intellectual history. In the 1960s, the mighty Dana Scott began working on a new axiomatization of set theory, grounded in type theory and the iterative conception. This work culminated in a talk he gave at a 1971 conference, whose proceedings were published in 1974. Scott was also supposed to be working on a monograph on set theory with Montague, who died in 1971, and Tarski, who died in 1983. The monograph will never appear, and Scott never fleshed out the intriguing proposals he published in 1974. Potter's book is the belated bloom of Scott set theory.  Greenberg is right about Mendelson's intro to NBG; it is a good introduction to the mechanics of axiomatic set theory, independently of Potter's book. Potter is also not as well disposed to Quinian set theory as I am.  I am puzzled by Potter's claim that Skolem arithmetic (just multiplication over the naturals) is finitely axiomatizable. Cegielski (1981) firmly asserts otherwise. 
 Here at last is a book that sees ecological economics not as a branch of economics or a school of economics but as a broader and deeper system of ideas that includes the sound elements of conventional economics. Herman Daly, the Grand Old Man of the steady state economy, and Joshua Farley, his able younger follower, have produced a comprehensive and very readable synthesis.  Traditional economists see natural resources as a subsystem of the world economy. This book presents the economy as a subsystem of the global ecosystem. The effect is like that of climbing a tall tower and seeing that a familiar city was all along part of an island whose fields and forests are in danger of disappearing under the advancing suburbs. The authors have not shied away from including controversial ideas, and there are some that I do not agree with, but that just adds to the stimulation. Not only have I adopted this as the textbook for a course in ecological economics, but I would like to see it read by all economists. This is not a specialist branch of economics; it is the only kind of economics appropriate to the new century 
 Let's face it, Van Damme has dished out some rather campy movies in the past 7 or so years.  However, there seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel thanks to this movie, along with the recent "Wake of Death."    "In Hell" is a raw and darker film than his normal material.  Don't expect his stamped karate moves, because it doesn't take place during this flick.  Instead, we are treated with gritty, no-holds barred rumbles.    To top it off, Van Damme begins to show signs of some acting depth.  I'm not talking Oscar winner, but for Damme, this is probably the best work he has done that provides a sense of substance to his character.    A moment or two of akward cheesy-ness appears, but doesn't hamper the overall experience of the movie at all. Even if you are not a Van Damme fan, like I "once" was, you should give this flick a shot.  Don't expect a masterpiece and I believe you will be surprisingly surprised 
 The reason I liked this game so much was the story line. It gives you choices to whether you want go to the light side or dark side and you could enhance a variety of Jedi powers. I have played this game serveral times and each time is different. The first time I went through this game I relied a lot on my swordsmanship with my lightsaber. The second time I played this game I relied more on my Jedi powers. Either way you play it I developed a different set of moves. It was awesome! Also I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN PLAY A WOMAN!! In every other Star Wars Game (except this sequel)you have to play a man and it gets a little irritating when you like adventure games just as much as any guy. I give the story line and the capabilities of the Jedi FIVE STARS 
 This book was about a boy named Sterling North.Sterling North is also the author of this book.This book was about Sterling finding a raccoon in May.He names the raccoon Rascal.They became very good friends.It was kind of sad at the end though.At the end, Sterling lets Rascal free. Thats what made me sad. I recommend this book four stars 
  Considering 'pulp romance' is the top selling genre, one could do a lot worse than the classic mother of all romances, "Pride & Prejudice".   This perceptive classic of English society plays out like a 19th century "Sex In The City."  Miscommunications abound. Just as you're about to scream, another dangle of hope transpires. Will the young lovers EVER end up on the same page?  I'm not telling you if you've missed this classic.  You'll have to read it. 
 I am very happy that I purchased this book, it is so easy to follow and has beautiful photos showing you how to make these gorgeous gourds. The instructions and techniques are easy to follow.   The Author Bonnie Gibson such an in depth way to make these beautiful, and marvelous gourds, she is truly a genius in the way she presents the way on how to make gourds, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make gourds, they will not be disappointed.. 
    Mark Stavish has done something I didn't think was possible.  He has made the practice of alchemy clear and completely understandable.  I've tried in the past to learn about alchemy from a variety of texts.  I read some of the history in these other books but was soon so caught in coded secrets and heiroglyphic chicken scratches my head was spinning. In the end,I just gave up on the whole subject.  On recommendation of a friend, I picked up Stavish' The Path of Alchemy and I'm so glad I did.    Stavish includes just enough history to frame the subject then gets right to how to do it.  No chicken scratch diagrams!  The illustrations are presented as the reader needs them and are clear and concise.  The author lays it all out, no secrets, makes his subject sing, and made it possible for me to begin the practice of alchemy in my home immediately.    I'll be looking for more books by Mark Stavish in the future.  I see he has one coming out about Kabballah in February.  I will definitely be buying it 
 I've recommended this cookbook to many over the last 5 years. The recipes are tasty and economical. Living in the heart of dairy country and unable to consume dairy products, and for some time meat, I was delighted not to  run into these over-used foods and still find tasty food. I use this  cookbook as a reference often. Includes an informative article on dietary  fat in the back. It's worth the purchase price 
 And so we come full circle with this the final volume of Classic Trek.  This volume is clearly the best one not only of Season 3 but also stands among the best ever among all 3 seasons.  Hence, if you are picking which volumes to keep, this one comes under the "must have at all costs" category.    In the first episode, "The Turnabout Intruder", we get a Gene Roddenberry credited story about women's lib and the injustice of gender discrimination which leads to desperation among women as they struggle for what's right.  This story is important as it comes at a time when women's lib was a far cry from what it is today showing Gene as a prophet of sorts in championing its cause way back when.  I thought the acting was very good and even William Shatner's impression of a slightly effeminate Kirk attempting to suppress his feminine tendencies so as not to arouse suspicion among the crew as worthy of mention.  While it may not be among the very best of all TOS episodes, it certainly ranks among the top of a very poor 3rd season though.  And now for the creme de la creme of the volume, "The Cage" in two versions no less with Gene Roddenberry himself giving the introduction and the final thoughts on the first version while I thought the second version was restored very, very well both in picture and sound quality too.  I have no doubt that had Jeffrey Hunter stayed on and not died an untimely death in real life, he would have been the best Captain the Enterprise ever had; he is by far the best actor of the lot and I include Patrick Stewart as well.  Overall, the acting of all the cast including guest star Susan Oliver, John Hoyt, Peter Duryea and the rest is exceptional.  Even the aliens sent shivers up my spine from their eerie looks to their malevalent stares unlike any of the other aliens from future episodes.  I personally think that this is ironically the best ever Star Trek TOS episode even if Spock is the only character that remains in future episodes.    As Gene Roddenberry has long gone to the next life, this volume is even more a collector's item as it has his thoughts on the episode and on the impact TOS has had overall up to the mid-80s when this was shot.  Overall, this is a must have volume for all Trek fans and indeed all fans of sci-fi television everywhere.  Very highly recommended. 
 The first song I heard by Hurt was, of course, "Rapture."  I was not hooked.  I even heard "Falls Apart" and wasn't entirely satisfied.  I liked the latter better than the first, but I noticed nothing too spectacular.  Then my friend was listen to the CD (me thinking, "Oh, great, 'Rapture' yet again) when "Overdose" came on.  For anyone who has ever taken prescription medication for a mental problem, you know the feelings of this song.  I've taken pills for depression and anxiety, and without the lyrics "Overdose" expresses the feels perfectly.  A very calm feeling at first, then frantic, insane bursts leaving you disoriented, wondering "Did that really happen?"  I started downloading all the songs after that.  "Falls Apart" became a favorite obviously, and "Rapture" grew on me.  But the true gems of this album are the ones most neglect.  "House Carpenter" was the one song I couldn't download, but it was oh so worth the wait to get the CD, which I ordered once I started downloading the songs.  "Unkind" and "Danse Russe" are perfects contrasts, yet they flow seamlessly. I keep hearing references to Tool when people talk about Hurt, but I never thought they sounded similar.  I've actually yet to think of a band to really compare to "this" type of rock.  Their name fits very well, though.  The music feels of one injured and lashing out.  At times the music brings to mind a man dying, and at others it feels more like the one doing the killing. The real beauty of this album, however, lies in its lyrics.  Like the best of writings, one cannot pick out one part of the whole to give an example.  If I were to try, I would simply end up typing out the entire booklet 
  For connoisseurs of New Yorker fiction editor and contributor Roger Angell's celebrated writings on all things baseball (GAME TIME, A PITCHER'S STORY, LATE INNINGS, etc.), his latest offering will be a change of pace. This collection of short vignettes, which was written in the last three years and loosely tied together into memoir format, is both slower going (rightly so) yet more free-flowing than his previous books. Overflowing with remembrances of past events, familial anecdotes, New Yorker insides and general day-to-day musings, LET ME FINISH is both a pleasure to read and an insightful look into the nooks and crannies of one man's lifetime over the last 70 or so years.  Although many may find all of the chapters interesting merely as records of a life lived, there are a few sections that stand out above the rest. In "Romance," Angell beautifully illustrates America's love affair with the open road by recounting various car trips taken during his childhood. He perfectly captures the quiet freedom unleashed when behind the wheel or in the back of a moving vehicle and pinpoints one of those quintessential moments when all seems right in the world and full of promise: "There were many reasons for my feeling so happy. We were on our way. I had seen a dawn...Ahead, a girl waited who, if I asked, would marry me, but first there was a long trip; many hours and towns interceded between me and that encounter."  Like many kids who grew up during the Prohibition era and the Depression, Angell was utterly bewitched with the burgeoning world of cinema. There was nothing quite like skipping school to sit in the delicious darkness of a movie theater, and every chance he got, he would treat himself to the latest double feature. Simple and sweet, the chapter entitled "Movie Kid" is pure delight and once again captures a period of time long since forgotten in the age of blockbuster films. "Anyone who was the wrong age or in the wrong place for this stuff --- my parents and my children, for instance, and even those who picked it up later from videos and American-studies classes --- never quite caught up. We were the lucky ones, we first citizens of film, and we trusted the movies for the rest of our lives."  Three of the most vivid and nostalgic chapters are "The King of the Forest," "Andy" and "Twice Christmas," in which Angell examines his roots. In "The King of the Forest," he pokes and prods at the memory of his father --- the aforementioned "King" in the title --- portraying him with an honesty and awe that only a son's gaze could muster. He lays bare his father's infidelities (a reason for his mother's departure) yet still manages to convey his utter respect and love for him as a father figure.  In "Andy," he gives due reverence to his stepfather, the renowned author and editor E. B. White (STUART LITTLE, CHARLOTTE'S WEB, THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE). By Angell's depiction, Andy seems like a kind man, full of wisdom, talent, and the one-of-a-kind hankering for words and sentiment that produced not only the industry's top guidebook for grammar and writing, but also one of the best children's books ever written. In "Twice Christmas," Angell marries --- or should I say divorces --- his two fathers by uniting them with the one thing they had in common: his mother. With almost unnatural clarity, he captures the awkward essence of growing up in a broken home by recounting the details of possibly the most important morning of a young boy's life --- Christmas morning --- first at his father's and then again, after an overstuffed and anxious taxi ride across town, at his mother's/Andy's.  Readers who light up at the mention of celebrity will delight in Angell's brief references to W. Somerset Maugham and Vladimir Nabokov, and will get a kick out of his recollections of fellow New Yorker staffers Charles McGrath, William Shawn, founder Harold Ross, William Mazwell and the like. But it is his dance with the familiar in LET ME FINISH that reaps its due reward. "Life is tough and brimming with loss, and the most we can do about it is to glimpse ourselves clear now and then, and find out what we feel about familiar scenes and recurring faces this time around."     --- Reviewed by Alexis Burling 
 Moms have a way of embarrassing us. They don't mean it of course. They just do it accidentally in public places. And from what I've heard they still do it long after you've moved out and started your own family. But we all still love them.  Savannah (from Savannah) is alarmed to hear that her mother has chained herself to the monument of the 10 commandments outside of the courthouse. She can't believe that her beauty queen mother, who always has to look perfect, is willing to sit outside in public in the same clothes for days. Thus Savannah tries to distance herself away from her mother, dealing instead with a homeless lady who keeps asking her for food, a beauty queen killing her boyfriend and a new female reporter who's caught the eye of every guy in town. Eventually, Savannah comes to realize her mother's stance and respects her.  I liked how this story had Savannah come to better terms with her mother. In the first book, the reader is shown how the two are completely different. This story had Savannah finally understanding her mom, standing up for her, and learning to be proud of her. I found the scenes with Amber funny as usual. Between her rehearsed speech on Ronald Reagan and her chasing and beating up the purse snatcher I was in stitches. The scenes with the picnic with Grant was touching because it's hard to when someone you love has moved on with another. I was also relived that Savannah has decided to cut back on the coke. It's a wonder that she doesn't suffer from caffeine overdose or stained teeth!  I'd recommend this book for anyone who likes chick lit, mother-daughter stories or Southern culture 
  Starting where her controversial (and bestselling) book The Christ Conspiracy left off, Suns of God guides the reader on an illuminating journey all the way back to the origins of the three greatest World Religions and the Triumvirate of its three deities: Krishna, Buddha, and Christ. Acharya demonstrates that the life stories and teachings of these three Demigods are suspiciously similar. Take for instance the tale of the virgin-born divine Teacher/Savior who overcomes demonic temptations, instructs his followers in sublime morality and ethics, works wonders and miracles, forms a band of followers, and is hailed as a Godsend far and wide. Then this Godman is finally persecuted, put to death, and resurrected. This tale is not unique to Christianity, but occurs many times throughout history, and all over the world, predating by centuries and even millennia the story of Jesus Christ.   The many Demigods or "Godmen" throughout history are not historical figures that just "happen" by coincidence to share the same nature and life story! No, these "Godmen" are all one and the same Mythic being under many names, a Myth that has been central to the so-called "Mystery religions" throughout recorded human history. This dying-and-rising Godman Myth is the focal point of a worldwide fellowship whose Mysteries reach back for many millennia. That is why these Godmen Myths are unbiquitous, and carry such an air of occult mystery. In fact, it is this Godman Myth that is behind the generation of a number of entire cultures! Acharya S explores all this and more as she takes the reader on a fascinating journey to Understanding. She reveals to the reader exactly why this Divine Myth was created, by divulging the secrets of the worldwide effort to illumine humanity through this central Mythical motif that is found all over the world. She also exposes those who wish to derail the purpose of this Myth by changing it's focus to...well, you'll have to read the book to find out!   Suns of God is the best and most comprehensive treatment of the History of Religion that has ever been offered in a single, readable, enjoyable volume. Suns of God is not merely a sequel, but a solid piece of research that stands on its own. I give this book five stars and two thumbs way up!   Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever! JEHOVAH UNMASKED is endorsed by Acharya S herself. 
 I was skeptical about buying a compilation CD set for fear it wouldn't be good... but I was wrong!   I can't get enough of these CD's.   I do Swing dance and Lindy Hop, and I think some of the tempos to these songs are a bit fast for dancing, but excellent for listening to when you just want to be in a good mood!  Keely has a great voice, and Louis is just plane hysterical : 
 The Disc are great but the way that they have them packaged worries me about keeping them safe.  I have placed them into a new package to keep them from scratching each other and having one drop because I am going for the one underneath it.  I am also a little disappointed that the first time that I touched the handbook that the cover fell off 
 This book reads like a friend whispering all the good advice and secrets of the interior design business in your ear. I wish my Professional Practices class had used this text.  It's a lot of information but Christine Piotrowski truly takes you by the hand and lets you know what you need to prepare for in a budding interior design business as well as how the interior design business is done in general.  I will be referencing this book again and again.  A huge thank you and bravo to Christine Piotrowsk 
 I bought this first Celtic Twilight, Vol. 3: Lullabies CD right after I had my first baby.  It has such beautiful music, and is not some of the sickly sweet lullaby music that you get on so many other CDs.    It has been a wonderful ritual that we have before we go to bed so that my son can settle down and go to sleep.  By track 2, he's usually snoring!  I'm buying another copy of the same CD for my second baby so that she can have the same soothing sounds to drift off to sleep.  I would highly recommend this CD 
 It's a MUST READ for everyone out there. Spiritually helpful 
 Our two older kids basically didn't fall asleep on their own for a long time, as well as woke up quite frequently at nights. We were big followers of Sears method. I think, our nervous system was quite drained as a result of bad and insufficient sleep.  With our third child we finally decided to try to teach him to go to sleep and sleep on his own and our pediatrician recommended this book.  Must note that, as the book warns you, it was NOT an easy thing for us as he cried for about 10-20 minutes for almost a week before falling asleep. He also did wake at night two-three times. We did come in after increasing intervals to be with him for a minute or so and it seemed to help him to cry less and less.  After two weeks he started sleeping through the whole night which was like a miracle to us. Now, a month later he sleeps 11-12 hours at night.   It is not true that we became desensitized because our 3 year old still wakes up sometimes and we have to respond to her calls.  The most important lesson from the book we learned is  1) Baby remembers how he falls asleep, i.e. associations. So if he falls asleep on his own when he goes to bed he is more likely to fall asleep when he wakes up at night (which is BTW quite normal). So if we have to breastfeed him to make him to sleep he will ask for it everytime he wakes up. 2) Maintaining schedule is hugely important due to the inherent body rythms.  Good luck to everyone 
 I loved this book, expecially because of the way its wrote. Classic dont be scared its all imaginary book. Besides the Berenstain Bears are completely awesome children stories and Teach little kids a nice lesson while decorating their minds with bright pictures 
 All these songs suit Guy's voice very well, and Guy delivers in his second album.  R&B is definitely his style and you can tell he exudes the real him through this genre.  I had 'Kryptonite' on a loop for the longest time because the tune is so catchy.  Overall great CD 
 My first HDTV, and it looks awesome!! I am very happy with the decision I made to purchase it. Only two issues:  1) I have an HDTV ready cable box (Comcast), and I originally hooked up the TV to the box with a regular coaxial cable. The picture quality was only so-so. Then, I purchased an HDMI cable (about $70), and the difference was amazing. I strongly recommend the HDMI cable to maximize your picture.  2) I have to re-program my 3-year old to keep him from touching the screen. At least he does not eat peanut butter  .  .   
 Actually, I thought "Penny Dreadful" was the most innovative film from the After Dark Horrorfest and certainly not the worst (that would be "The Hamiltons," hands down).  I went the whole route with the "8 Films 2 Die 4," catching all eight films at their first showings each day, buying my tickets in advance to get the free t-shirt, and then waiting for the monster it depicted to show up in one of the films (it never happened).  In between the films while we got our free pop refills (I recommend just getting your large drink filled up halfway so you can make it all the way through the movie), we would sit around and dissect each film and make recommendations ("Audition" was the film most mentioned).  At the end the festival my impromptu straw poll found that "Penny Dreadful" had as much support as any other film for the "best of show" title that would earn one of the eight a general release.  We thought they would go with "Dark Ride" as the most commercially viable of the bunch, but they ended up picking "The Abandoned," which had its own uniqueness in that the heroine is a mature woman twice the age of the title character in this film.  This was the third movie on the second day and I should explain that we had a running gag going regarding the connection between women and cars established in these films.  The first day ended with "Dark Ride," which involved the heroine driving a mini-van through a wall at the right time and at the right place to save the day.  The second day started with "The Gravedancers," in which the same thing happened (I think it was an SUV that time).  That was followed by "The Abandoned," which begins and ends with a woman driving a giant farm truck.  So by the time "Penny Dreadful" started we were all chuckling at the fact the characters were in such a small vehicle because it was just a standard car.  The car in question is being driven by Orianna Volker (Mimi Rogers of "Ginger Snaps"), a psychologist who is trying to get Penny Dearborn (Rachel Miner of "The Guiding Light") over her phobia of cars.  We will find out via flashbacks that she was in a car accident that claimed the lives of her parents, so she has good reason to be traumatized by the experience and want to avoid driving around in a car again.  But Orianna is taking Penny on a road trip to help her get over her phobia.  Penny has to stop at every gas station along the way so she can puke up her guts and then things get worse.  When Orianna clips a pedestrian on a lonely stretch of mountain road she figures the least she can do is give the guy a ride.  The fact that his face is obscured by a hood and that he has a skewer of meat with him does not set off the alarm bells for Orianna that are telling the rest of us that this was a big mistake (have you seen the commercial where the guy picks up the hitchhiker with the ax because the guy is carrying Bud Light and claims it is just a can opener?).    Now you know full well that given this setup that Orianna is going to be dead and Penny is going to have to face the hitchhiker.  What you do not expect is that most of the film is going to take place IN that little car (do not ask how the maniac set up this scenario, just go with it).  At that point you will be thinking that there is not that much you can do given this scenario, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  Director Richard Brandes ("Out for Blood") co-wrote the screenplay with Diane Doniol-Valcroze ("Kill by Inches").  There are not a lot of horror films that come up with such a simple scenario and then stick to it (I always think of Stephen King's short story "Survivor Type" and novel "Gerald's Game" as examples of the one note take to extreme approach).  Yes, the initial requisite bad decision is compounded by a series of other fatal errors (I believe I actually said "Drive on the rims" out loud in the theater), but fortunately this 2006 horror film relies more on Penny's phobia and the specific situation to play out the story.  Given Penny's phobia I bet you think you know exactly how this movie has got to end, but the ending for this movie does not go for the obvious.  Again, this speaks to the determination of Brandes to go against expectations and to come up with something different.  I certainly appreciated the audacity of doing a slasher film where most of the action is set in and around a car stuck in the woods.  The net result is not a great horror film, and if your taste runs to the extreme gore of films like "Saw III," "Wolf Creek," "Hostel," et al., then this one is going to seem dreadfully tame.  But I was pleasantly surprised and hopefully most of you who decide to check out "Penny Dreadful" on DVD will feel the same 
 This is a provocative, demanding and rewarding book that attempts to grapple with some of the central challenges of Christian thought and life in a modern or post-modern world. Looking through Amazon and one or two other online sites, it is clear that many readers have also read Mark A. Noll's The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind. I have too; and by way of introduction to David F. Wells' book, it is worth making brief reference to the other.  Both books touch on similar subjects, though with different emphases. Both are concerned with the decline of what Noll calls "the life of the mind" within American evangelicalism; and both are concerned with how authoritative Christian thought can be sustained in this modern or postmodern world. I suspect that Noll's book has proved the more popular, even if the only direct evidence for that is the number of customer reviews on this site: 29 for Noll; 12 for Wells. And both books were published a year apart -- Wells in 1993, and Noll the following year. With a title like that, Noll was always going to be onto a winner!  However, I suspect that one of the reasons for these differing figures is that Wells writes from a different perspective, one that ultimately makes more demands on the reader. Another might be that Wells' position is subtly yet noticeably more pessimistic. Noll is an historian who is eminently capable of working in theology; Wells is a theologian who is eminently capable of working in history. One only has to look at satellite television to realise which of these subjects is the more popular; and I hope that nobody reading this review imagines that Christian television has any connection with theology!  One of the great strengths of this book is that it approaches its subject with the very breadth of thought that both authors find wanting in evangelicalism in general. While its focus is on North America, it spreads its net wide; and Wells is especially good at teasing out subtle relationships between culture and religious thought. It also manages to be at once highly opinionated, generous in spirit, full of subtle humour, and intensely passionate.  How's this for a start? When, in his Introduction Wells asserts his "disbelief in much that the modern world holds dear" (p. 10), he also says that while he feels he must use this pugnacious style, he intends "no disrespect either for the reader or for the modern world. After all, I work for the one and must live with the other. The pugnacity is only in the appearance, not in the intention. The problem is that even the mildest assertion of Christian truth today sounds like a thunderclap because the well-polished civility of our religious talk has kept us from hearing much of this kind of thing." He then draws on John Kenneth Galbraith and G.K. Chesterton, to demonstrate a point that has nothing of religion or theology in it -- at first. So when the theological point arrives, it has force: "Evangelicals are antimodern only across a narrow front; I write from a position that is antimodern across the entire front. It is only where assumptions in culture directly and obviously contradict articles of faith that most evangelicals become aroused and rise up to battle 'secular humanism'; aside from these specific matters, they tend to view culture as neutral and harmless. More than that, they often view culture as a partner amenable to being coopted in the cause of celebrating Christian truth. I cannot share that naivete; indeed, I consider it dangerous. Culture is laden with values, many of which work to rearrange the substance of faith, even when they are mediated to us through the benefits that the modern world also bestows upon us."  This epitomises Wells' ability to lay a profoundly humane groundwork for a theological starting-point, and then for an entire historical and theological argument; and that is one of the main reasons why this book is such a compelling indictment of contemporary evangelical theology. Or perhaps I should say non-theology; for that is what Wells finds everywhere -- though like Noll, he finds the malady less prevalent outside the USA.  Beavers who are over-eager might get impatient at Wells' methods. Indeed, I suspect that at the root of one or two of the more negative responses this book has received, there lies a typically modern impatience. But for those willing to take time, there are rewards a-plenty. For example, the opening chapter's title is "A Delicious Paradise Lost." The Eden-like innocence belongs to the town of Wenham, Massachusetts, in the two hundered of so years after the town's foundation in the 1630s by a group of puritans of English descent. Less than ten years later an English visitor described the place as "a delicious paradise" which he would choose "above all towns in America to dwell in." Via authoritative comparisons with contemporary towns in Britain and America (the book has plenty of informative footnotes and cross-references), Wells charts Wenham's growth, which was very slow. He embraces the role of the church as a building and as community of believers (and a community which included many who were nominal believers); he shows how, as people of differing religious backgrounds moved into the town, they interacted with the dominant puritan heritage; and he follows the lives of a number of prominent figures, notably the schoolteacher. This was a community defined partly by its strong sense of place, and partly by its awareness of how people lived together -- or how they should live together. Of course, it wasn't really Eden. But until well into the 19th century it was so utterly different from the modern world that we might imagine it to be such.  In a series of similar historically rooted pictures, Wells shows how those qualities disappeared, to be replaced by transience, by superficiality. In one of his many virtuoso analogies, he shows how Truman Capote (1924-84) was transformed by publicity "from an author of some initial repute into a personality. . . He bonded briefly with his devotees, but the bond was synthetic. In this new world, the statues are made of celluloid, not of stone; here the achievements are those of personality, seldom of character. . . This is experience without community. It is the experience of mankind in the mass, bereft of the forces that once drew it into centers of human fraternity and organization." Gloomy stuff! But it has precision and insight.  All this proves to be an essential preliminary for the theological discussion that makes up by far the larger part of this book. The theological discussion is fed from the ground up, by being rooted in the communities in which theology should, and at one time did, hold its discourse. The third chapter takes its title, "Things Fall Apart", from Yeats' poem The Second Coming (yet another example of the broad synthesis that characterises this book), and charts the decline of theology from its place as the "queen of sciences" to an irrelevance, even in the evangelical world to which Wells and most of those who will read his book belong.  Wells explains, with a magisterial grasp of history, culture and theology, how the decline of evangelical theology in the last two hundred is a direct result of the church's engagement with the world and its prevailing culture. It is a striking demonstration of the adage that the church rarely now turns the world upside (Acts 17:6); rather, the world has turned the church upside down. Hence the title: the church has been so concerned with accommodating itself to the world that it has forgotten how to sustain the mission God intended it to have to the world.  Wells shows how thought, including that of some greats of American theology, became gradually corrupted by this accommodation. Along the way the religious institutions have become corrupted too. One of his most devastating critiques is of the modern seminary. Great institutions like Princeton and Yale began with Christian values at their core, with subjects designed from a Christian perspective. But as these universities have become inexorably secularised, other institutions had to take over their role; and those in turn have been run off their feet to maintain recognition by the world. Many of the qualifications issued by modern Christian colleges, including doctorates, have very little real value: they merely provide a veneer of respectability so that being a pastor might appear to have the same worldly status as being a lawyer, an academic or a doctor. It is not just that there is little reflection: there is no time for it.  As for the corruption of the church's life . . . I'll leave you to read the examples Wells gives, which are shocking even to someone who knows something of what the God Channel and things of that kind spew out indiscriminately.  As I say, this is not an optimistic book. But it is honest. It offers few large-scale solutions. But it is a clarion call to those who read it, and who believe that we should indeed love the Lord our God with all our minds. If one follows Well's thesis through, it becomes clear that institutions are not readily amenable to reformation. But individuals are. Just as the Gospel began with individuals, so it will be with individuals that any reformation of theology will begin 
 Like the other book I've read by Robert Solomon, "Spirituality for the Skeptic," this book appears to have a lay audience in mind at least, but in reality it's aimed only at the academic community of philosophers.   The irony which has twice misled me is that the book's central argument is that philosophy ought to be directed at laymen rather than the academic community. Insofar as it is not, Solomon believes, philosophy has lost its calling.  Otherwise, the book moves through a few minor themes, arranged as chapters. One is that passionate reasoning, rather than dispassionate reasoning, is the key to good philosophy and fulfillment in life. He's written another book on the philosophy of love, and another on Nietzsche, and both of those played a big role in this chapter. A second theme was the role of emotion in politics and social relations. In my review of "Spirituality," I criticized Solomon for going on about science this and science that while appearing totally unfamiliar with science, but in this chapter he proved me wrong, showing some familiarity, but not uncritical acceptance, with evolutionary psychology. The third chapter argues that ethics is inherently emotional, it cannot be purely rational, contrary to the hopes of so many theorists. The fourth chapter elaborates on this, looking closely at justice, sympathy and vengeance. I was uninterested and didn't read this chapter well, but it appeared to me that he argues that there is no objective justice, while supporting the thesis of chapter three. I barely made it through this chapter.  Chapter five set the book on fire for me: it is essentially about the problem of evil: how do we make sense of suffering. He reminded me of Unamuno, a philosopher I fell in love with one day in college, and evidently forgot the next. I'll have to remember him this time. He discusses free will, fate, luck, and so on; the theme of the chapter seemed to be: silly philosopher, you are not as rational as you think you are. But this IS the kind of thing that philosophy should think about. And then philosophers would have a role in real life, and maybe then there'd be a few more university positions for them.  The sixth chapter was another good one, this time on death. Most of the chapter was a meditation on how hard it is to really realize that I, me, the dude thinking, am going to die. Solomon covered the subject fairly, including a few references to Chuang Tzu and Epicurus, two of my personal favorite philosophers. I think a missing reference that would really help with this project of thinking through death is the great English divine, Jeremy Taylor; or perhaps, the admonitions from the Orthodox Christian tradition about the remembrance of death. Anyway, my personal belief is that none of us can be too conscious of the fact that we are going to die, and live our lives accordingly. So I applaud this chapter; it serves its purpose.  Chapters seven and eight, on "recovering personal identity" and self-deception appear to be responses to academic debates with which I am unfamiliar, especially regarding the nature of the self. It appears to me, an outsider, that philosophy is responding to developments in cognitive science, rather than leading the way, and will continue to do so for awhile. Let me recommend Owen Flanagan if you're interested in this sort of thing, because I've found his writing much more relevant and purposeful than Solomon's; the latter often seems to be writing his thoughts rather than writing about anything in particular. That's fine of course, unless you want to read about something in particular.  Unfortunately, I think I'm done with Solomon now. I've read two of his books, as charitably as I can, and both of them seemed to me, as I said above, to be addressing solely the academic community of philosophers, ironically arguing that the academic community of philosophers shouldn't address solely the academic community of philosophers. Reading such books is quite frustrating of course, because I personally don't have any concern over the academic (you know). But I do love philosophy.  It reminds me A LOT of the famous line from Kierkegaard's "Either/Or" about a sign in a shop window; the sign says "pressing done here," and a guy goes in to get his clothing pressed, only to be informed that the sign is for sale, that in fact pressing is not done here.  If you're in a position similar to mine, let me recommend Julian Baggini's "What's it all About?" as a wonderful, strongly opinionated but lightly written introduction to serious philosophical thought about the meaning of life 
 As a physician's spouse, I found this book very timely even though it was written more than 10 years ago.  Every physician and their spouse should read this book, especially those in the 38-45 year old age group. The  authors describe what drives a physician, what happens when reality does  not meet their expecations, and how it impacts their spouse, children and  their personal lives. I hope Dr. Menninger releases a new edition of this  book soon 
 A unique book for its field, Duranti et al.'s volume contains a good number of roughly 1000 word entries, a decent number of which have been written by well-known and respected linguistic anthropologists; the size constraint on the individual articles has, of course, both its upsides and downsides- the former being, for instance, a concise analytic precision not always found in anthropology monographs, the latter being then the obverse of that coin, a certain lack of feel for the subject due to the lack of narrative, fieldwork, etc. For one willing to follow up the various bibliographies, this book can go a long way in making up for that defect, however. Best for the reader with an intermediate knowledge of the subject, I'd say, though useful for almost anyone simply because it contains so much up-to-date received knowledge- not to mention that, no matter where one's interests in linguistic anthropology lie, one will most likely find via the bibliographies some previously unknown source bearing on them. Also good, I would presume, at socializing one into the field, helping one to start talking like a scholar of language and culture, at least about some of the theoretical issues involved. A bit expensive, I think, for what it is, but all in all a quite useful book to have lying around 
 My grandson who is a huge Wiggles fan, loves his new Wiggles Cutlery set and uses it every day. The set is sturdy and just perfect for a three year old 
 i really like the wireless mini mouse. I have a notebook which i love but i dont like to use the square box  you call the mouse box. i like the fact you  can just plug it in and use it just like a desk top  
 Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. Full of eyewitness accounts at many of the major actions of the War for Independence, this book is well organized and a very enjoyable read. I highly recommend it 
 This publication breaks the braid design, which looks quite difficult and challenging, into an easy-to-follow step-by-step process. Since a properly graduated color palette is a key component in the project success, the explanation of color value and the selection of sample fabric lines is a good visual guide. Looking at completed quilts in a variety of color options is fun and inspirational 
 ...is the most beautiful and stirring sequence ever produced by Bunuel.  The second half drags a little, but the ending is stunning.  You are left with a sense of having peered into a dream 
 Comer tells the story of his family by focusing on the remarkable life of his mother, Maggie Comer, whose determination helped her survive poverty and segregation in the South and discrimination in the North to raise of family of successful children. The first half of the book is told in Maggie's own words. The second half is in Comer's. An excellent example of the broader social migration of black families from the South to the North following Reconstruction 
 I think that only mature people should read this because there is a lot of swearing in it and sexual stuff. Other than that I think that this book is a very good book. I couldn't put it down it was so good. I think that any person who wants to read this book will love it and will read it over and over again. 
 Alright. A few things. If you don't like heavy music, you can click the "back" button on your browser now. This is insane stuff. Assuming you're down with brutal headbang-worthy guitar crunch, read on.  I'm partial. I'm a huge fan of Zakk Wylde. Not so much because I love the music above all else (though many people do), but because Zakk Wylde is one of the greatest guitar players the world has ever seen. Hendrix is blown out of the water next to this guy. And Angus Young? Please. The only people who can claim to come close technique-wise are the shredders (satch, vai, malmsteen, etc.) and music-wise his role model (randy rhoads). My humble opinion of course.  So if you want to hear some ridiculous guitar playing, pick up anything with Zakk's name on it. And yeah, that includes this 
 I vaguely remembered this film from cable or Network TV. At the time of release in the go-go eighties It seemed to be somewhat of an anomaly in it's highly critical view of the role of the first world in the third world's misery.  I agree somewhat with the review of "bad writing" sating the sugarcoating of the role of the US  in the murder of hundreds of thousands of leftists  just as VietNam is getting underway. Also the film reminded me somewhat of "The Quiet America", "Missing", "The Killing Fields"...in that it showcases what goes wrong in the third world when there is outside meddling.  The romance (between Sigourney Weaver and Mel Gibson) and the social political issues don't fit as well as they could, or only one plot line- preferably the social political- in my opinion may have made this more powerful. But, like the somewhat happy ending, this type of sugarcoating is, unfortunately, usual Hollywood fare. Nevertheless, this may be Gibson's and Weaver's finest roles. It definitely is their most  socially conscious.  Helen Hunt, playing Billy, in a transgendered role, is fabulous and worthy of and OSCAR and more. And the journalists, and other westerners, are also played very well and quite smarmy and, as in the case of the  British General and embassy party, are indicative of the ongoing power and the somewhat anachronistic roles of empire- particularly the British.  Finally I wish the movie could have been a bit longer and offer more depth, but as in 90% of films it couldn't exceed the two hour maximum tradition. Also the movie displays incidents of 1965 and was made in 1983, but it seemed like it could of taken place yesterday.It's too bad there isn't a movie similar to this of the current Middle Eastern debacle.

 That knows how to sing. Sing to her poop's content I might add. And I did. Any amateur, crappy or overrated female vocalists out there, take notes from this phenomenal vocal talent. If you want to hear what a real woman's singing voice sounds like, look no further than Sarah McLachlan and this album. There are four shining standouts on this album for me and they would be Sweet Surrender, Building A Mystery, Adia and Angel. They feature some of the most gorgeous vocals I have ever heard. She is one of the only solo female singers I have ever given more than a glance in terms of listening. As a rule this isn't my kind of music but I will give it a listen every now and again purely because of how great her voice is and not really because of the actual music.   Truly one of the best singing voices in existence 
 This is one of the funniest, greatest, and well sung music compilations I've ever heard 
 Foster's book, with entries by some of the leading players in the field, is an invaluable resource for anyone trying to understand not just the science behind nanotechnology (actually, a number of different scientific areas), but its implications for the future of technology and how we'll get there from here. An outstanding and timely resource - if you want to understand the nano sector today, and where it's going, you have to read it 
 A gripping and honest account of the role that the UN, Europe and USA have had in the Rwanda genocide with the cowardliness of their politics more marketing oriented than interested in the humanitarian cause. Any one thinking about voting for the Clintons again should see this, to grasp the real level of leadership they can produce under heat. Not to mention Kofi Annan (Nobel prize winner ???) a real butcher in diplomat's clothes

 This item is exactly what it is described as, a perfect ultra-light yet durable garment bag.  Very spacious with lots of storage compartments for various packing needs.  Expands as needed to accomodate even a 3 or 4 day trip.  Light yet durable.  Nice 
 Jim Kjelgaard is a really great writer of dog stories set in the outdoors.  "Big Red" is the first of three Irish Setter books.  If you like "Big Red" the second book is "Irish Red" and the third one is "Outlaw Red".  Danny lives with his father in a shack back in the mountains.  They run a trap line and harvest wild honey for money.  They are squatters on the land of a rich man, Mr. Haggin.  Danny's mother died a long time ago.  Danny and his father make a little money on the side by doing work for Mr. Haggin.  Mr. Haggin has a beautiful Irish Setter he calls Boy.  When Danny sees him, it's love at first sight.  But when Danny asks Mr. Haggin how much a dog like Boy would cost, Mr. Haggin says he paid $7000 for him.  Danny knows a trapper could never afford a dog like that.  Mr. Haggin takes an interest in Danny.  It is clear that Danny is different from his father, he has some kind of quality he inherited from his mother, tempered by the ruggedness and independence he learned from living in the wilderness.  Mr. Haggin gives Danny a job taking care of Boy, who Danny calls Red.  Like Danny, Red shows special quality.  But he has never done for himself.  He's a show dog.  Mr. Haggin sends Danny to New York with Red when he's in a dog show.  Then when they go back to Mr. Haggin's ranch, Danny is allowed to take Red out in the wilderness.  Red learns from Danny how to be a brave and rugged dog.  Red and Mr. Haggin give Danny a chance to move into the civilized world, and Danny gives Red a chance to reach his potential as a real dog in the outdoor world.  An earlier reviewer made a great point that applies to all of Mr. Kjelgaard's books I have read:  the dog doesn't have to be killed in his books.  Most great dog stories are very sad.  Examples would be "Sounder", "Where the Red Fern Grows", and "Old Yeller".  I don't really like to watch most dog movies, because the dog always dies.  The worst that happens to the dogs in Mr. Kjelgaard's books is a broken leg, or a bad wound that heals.  No kleenex needed, no broken hearts here.      
 Context:  the first Todd Snider album I heard was Happy to Be Here from 2000.  I thought "how come this guy isn't more widely known?" while listening -- in twelve or thirteen tracks -- to some rock, some blues, some melancholy, and among all that several gems, most particularly, D.B. Cooper.  Sardonic, as tough on himself as on easy target others in his music, he reminded me of Randy Newman and, most especially, John Prine.  Now Songs for the Daily Planet comes across my scope, bringing with it some partial answer to my question, for Snider was in the same place six years ago -- uptempo My Generation skewers, well, his generation.  Easy Money is a bluesy account of trying to get what you haven't earned. That Was Me, a bit of self-pity in a road song.  Turn It Up, life's bad, play the music loud, and the classic on this CD, You Think You Know Somebody, a far more effective take on child abuse than Luka whose royalties are still paying Suzanne Vega's rent.  I heard these songs after I heard Happy to Be Here so they seem faintly derivative.  But of course it's the other way round and overall, this is a slightly better collection than Happy to Be Here, but D.B. Cooper is still the pick hit for me 
 This important book has been around for a decade, and I'm pleased to see  it is still in print. Rutter, a psychiatrist affiliated with the C.G.Jung  Institute, was one of the first authors I know of to publish a book in the  popular press about this topic. He demonstrates clearly the essential  nature and healing potential of maintaining appropriate boundaries in  helping relationships. Although I might, as a female mental health  professional, take issue with his unilateral depiction of the  man-as-powerful/woman-as-victim dynamic, his point is certainly well taken.  I've read this book twice over the years 
 Not quite as good as I expected, but some good material.  He does point up some good illustrations of not understanding what numbers mean.  Some v ery good info on coincidence, happenstance, chances of things happening, etc. Worth the read 
 If you read this book with an open mind, you will learn so much from it!  There is so much wisdom that can be found in this book that will take you to a new level in your life if you follow the truth.  An amazing book with lots of information on it, a wonderful teaching book.  His style of writing is like he has a conversation with you, and this is very comforting when you read it even though you are absorbing a lot of information.  I highly recommend this book 
 When anything is modern, it means that it's from this era=this time=now. But also, "MODERN" things point to the design movement that grew from the 1920's Modernism movement. That is why many of the Modern pieces such as Charles and Ray Eames pieces are considered "classic", despite the tag("Modern Furniture") that follows them. So I think this book shows great examples of furniture designs from Modernism era and its following influences. I disagree with Ping Lim about not having shown all the recent great works, because I think Karim Rashid and Aeron chair are considered either post post modern or futurism, not modernism 
 And even at its worst, it still beats crappy latter-day albums such as Flick of the Switch! 1. Go Down: 6.5/10. Bleah. Nothing too memorable, but not bad either. 2. Dog Eat Dog: 6/10. See Go Down. 3. Let There Be Rock: 10/10. Bon Scott proves why Brian Johnson will never truly replace him. His lyrics, about the "birth" of rock, are hilarious. Sure, the Young brothers throw out riff after riff, but in the end, this is the Bon Scott show.  4. Bad Boy Boogie: 10/10. AC/DC's version of the classic blues rave-up tune, and it works very well. One of their most underrated tunes. 5. Problem Child: 7.5/10. I don't see why this song was recylced from Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. I mean, back when this came out it made sense because Dirty Deeds wasn't released in the US until '81, but why not replace it with Crabsody in Blue, the song it replaced? That said, it's still a good song, and for whatever reason sounds better here than on Dirty Deeds. 6. Overdose: 5.5/10. Overdose, you are the Weakest Link. Goodbye! 7. Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be: 10/10. A solid rocker, with a bad reputation it doesn't deserve. It's not about Satanism (AC/DC actually wasn't Satanic), but about a bad relationship and how, in Bon Scott's eyes at least, it's better than no relationship at all. 8. Whole Lotta Rosie: 10/10. One of AC/DC's most famous songs, a dirty rocker based on one of Bon Scott's real-life groupies. This song rocks in every sense of the word (a bad joke, I know) and is one of AC/DC's greatest-ever tunes. Overall: 8.19. AC/DC's breakthrough, not quite at the level of Back in Black, Highway to Hell or Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap but still a good listen 
 "The Breast Cancer Book of Strength and Courage" was a wonderful source of comfort and encouragement.  Having been recently diagnosed with breast cancer, I could truly relate to the feelings other women in the book experienced.  I too had to make so many decisions in a short period of time.  As I read the book, I realized how many other women had been in that same terrifying place, and how many women met the challenge of healing head on.  Every woman's cancer is different, but the feelings that accompany the daignosis are the same.  I truly appreciate the honesty and the willingness of all of the survivors who shared their stories.  I would highly recommend the book to all women with breast cancer and to their families 
 This is a superb book, but it's probably not helpful to think of it as fitting any conventional intellectual categories. It isn't exactly an argument, but it isn't exactly a purely frivolous piece of work either. It  can best be described as a pseudo-argument which, through internal  paradoxes developed with something like the methods of modernist poetry,  initiates the reader -- when it's properly read -- into a  foundering-of-the-mind similar to the foundering-of-the-mind aimed at by  Zen koans. In other words: experiential metaphysics -- living philosophy 
 I am a hugh Black Moon fan since the early 90's. I just recently heard about this album, so I had to purchase it. And Damn, I was impressed!!!! Buckshot and 9th Wonder really do have good Chemistry. All lyrics and beats are on point.  There is not a song on this CD I found worth skipping nor did I found any of the guest appearances wack. Everyone on the CD make this CD worth the cashflow, U will not be disappointed. You can't go wrong with Buckshot on the MIC and 9th Wonder on the boards!!!  The songs that stand out for ME are Chemistry 101, He's Back, Out Of Town, Slippin', Side Talk, No Comparison, Birdz, U Wonderin', and Money Makes The World Go Round. And not to downplay any of the other tracks cause the entire CD is TOP NOTCH (Stellar)!!!  "F" what U heard!!! Buckshot/9th Wonder Stay Real for ya'll non-believer, hating cats 
 Mama may not have had a great education, but she sure had plenty common sense, and was able to raise a boy who would become someone great is his own right. What Mama Taught Me is a great book. I enjoyed reading it. I truly learned a lot of things within it. It is great when someone can take a child that is not their own and raise them to be great, and even though Ms.Sanford is not here today, she certainly deserves the props she got for raising this man. One of the things that I have learned is to be true to who you are. He mentioned those who were not true to their ethnic and racial background, which was an eye opener to say the least. Get a copy and be enlightened 
 This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The seamless web of ideas about the origins of Shakespeare's plays Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night is so original and refreshing in todays age of film that it makes this movie watchable dozens of times 
 This book is to the point and well written; I enjoyed reding it! In fact having read a lot of other DOM books I would rate this one in the best top 10! Great ideas and methods, great information and a real look inside the DOM mind 
 First of all, I should mention that I am a Chinese applicant that is not so familiar with the application system in the U.S. but want to study in the Amercian colleges, so my suggestion will be effective to those international students.  This small book told me a lot about the details in the admission office of how they decide to admit or deny you. Furthermore, Mr. Bauld wrote like a tutor beside you to inform you how to present a great masterpiece that can affect in your application. What I have read are the methods to create the essays you wanna show to the officers. We often have a lot ideas in mind but do not know how to organize them and change them into an essay, that is what this book will help us to solve! 
 Anyone looking for a chronicle of the American wilderness in its infancy would do well to start here.  There is great charm in the journals of 1820, where the spellings are still Audubon's own, and the flavor of the times -- especially regarding life on the frontier, and concerning everyday life in old New Orleans -- is everywhere.  With his "Bird Biographies" of everyday varieties, as well as descriptions of now-extinct species, such as the Carolina Parakeet, and Ivory Billed Woodpeckers, this book is a treasure not just for nature lovers and bird aficianados, but for lovers of history as well 
 I RECOMMEND HIGHLY.  THIS TAPE REALLY PUTS YOU IN A BETTER FRAME OF MIND IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH PUTTING.  VERY WELL DONE 
 This was an all time favorite of ours.  The perfect cast for a great movie 
 I used to hate batteries. That was until I used these little babies! "Stay back - I've got a Rayovac" should be the tagline for these cosmic tripple-A (Alkaline AA) batteries. I used them to power some small electronic circuits I build (a hobby of mine) and these things last much, much longer than any other brand I've tried (and I've tried a lot!) Great value! "You won't want your money back once you've bought a Rayovac!" Keep up the good work boys 
 This was a strange book. But, the moment that I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  I found this book to be humorous and a very quick read.  In a nutshell:  Stephanie's marriage of thirteen years is ended by her husband. She finds another love, Peter,  and strange things happen.  Without giving away the plot, I wondered thoughtout this book if she has a disorder, is delusional, if Peter has a twin, if he has a disorder or if he is delusional......it kept me guessing.  The end was not what I had expected and that was part of the fun of the book.  If you are looking for a serious read, an emotional read, a true love story....then save your time and skip this book.  Once again, I'm glad that I did not look at the ratings first or I would not have read this book.  I would imagine that others gave it only one star or slightly more because they were looking for something other than what this book offered. But, if you're looking for a fun, quick, quite different, keep-you-guessing book, I'd recommend this book.  I didn't give the book 5 stars because, although the situations are often quite humorous, there are times when I had had enough of Paul.  
 King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one.  There were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing.  For the most part, not bad.  Would make a good movie 
 I found this book funny and easy to read.  Within a day of doing the exercises recommended I started to experience small to big miracles. The authors are down to earth and their principles are sound.  I highly recommed this book 
 Through the Lens is a collection of some of the best photographs that were stored in the archives of The National Geograhic society. However, like many other people have already said, these are not National Geographic's "greatest photographs". While many of the photographs in this book are among the greatest, not all of them are...  I still recommend that you buy this book simply because these this is a great collection of some of National Geographic's greatest photographs, but I highly recommend picking up "The National Geographic Society: 100 Years of Adventure and Discovery" to go with it. If this book has most of National Geographic's greatest photographs, then 100 years of adventure and discovery has, well... I dont want to say that it has the rest of them, but it at least has another large chunk of NG's greatest photographs. Oh, and did I mention it's cheap too? Seriously, I only paid 25 cents plus shipping & handling for my copy of 100 years of adventure and discovery! What are you waiting for 
 Dillard is an amazing writer. Reading this is almost like floating down a river; the beauty around you is so overwhelming that you don't catch everything but what you do is simply breathtaking.  I can't wait to read more of her works because this is such a phenomenal read -- even if you're not into nature or the outdoors.  
 What a great little piece of kit. It's great with my EF 70-200mm f/4L.  The only drawback is you've no AF.  You are forced to use manual focus. Now this isn't a big problem, unless you're photographing wildlife or moving objects.  Well worth the price though and very useful 
 This cd is AWESOME! and chely wrote/co-wrote all of these songs which in my opinion makes a great artist! This cd is highly recomended! 
 Heavy, depressing and slow, yet rich and emotional, has the power of High on Fire with a tempo more like Isis.  Moments to Ruin opens the album with the sweetest riff ever.  Pike's vocals are a bit rustic on this one- even compared to HoF.  Some questionable moments as he explores new territory......he goes a bit too far with the tortured goblin/muppet [...] for my taste at times......but the more melodic stuff is interesting. This album grows on you and if you liked Sleep and HoF you will probably like Kalas.  Has a similar sort of Tolkien metal feel that will keep you coming back for more 
 This is a perfectly charming book, delightfully rhymed and beautifully illustrated with woodcuts that reach the level of art.  I ordered a copy for my grandchildren on the basis of Mary Azarian's Caldecott Medal last  year, and on receiving it immediately ordered another for the inner-city  pre-school program where I volunteer.  The director thought it one of the  finest pre-school books she has ever seen.  The story of this counting book  is told with dignity and charm, and the ending is especially lovely,  engaging all the small children to whom I've read it.  This belongs in  every literate young child's library 
 I was Dr. Rose's history student in the undergrad and graduate levels at Florida Atlantic University (Boca Raton) Florida from 2003 to the middle of 2004. Dr. Rose beside being an excellent history professor he also is a great urban historian. His book Interstate: Express Highway Politics, 1939-1989, beside being a good book to read and enjoy, also is a great research resource for students of Urban American History. I did enjoy his book and his teaching. Professors like Dr. Rose are very few in the academic world 
 This book had some good tools for parents to use, but it seemed a little too negative.  It tended to treat teens like a foreign enemy that cannot be possibly understood, and must be strongarmed into good behavior.  A better book, in my opinion, is "52 Ways to Protect Your Teen" by Susie Vanderlip.  This book takes a more positive, love-based angle and teaches us to remember what it was like for us to be a teenager all those years ago.  I think that is a way better approach to building a stronger relationship with a teenage child. This book is unfortunately no longer available from Amazon, but can be purchased at www.waystoprotect.com  
 The Tempest is rightly regarded as being one of the Bard's greatest works, containing some of his deepest thoughts on the nature of power and the relationship between rational man as controller of nature, and the animal man always to be at the mercy of the passions both of himself, others, and the world around him. In fact, this play could be thought of as representing Shakespeare's final and definitive statement on topics that he had explored throughout his cannon. But profound as the philosophy is, and despite the beauty of the poetry and the many magical elements contained within the play, the fact is that as far as the average attention lacking teenager is concerned, not a lot happens. This is why this Cambridge schools edition scores over most others. It is almost entirely activity focused, the expressed aim being to 'bring the play to life'. With at least one suggested activity beside each page of Shakespeare's text (as well as a decent amount of background notes and interpretation), every teacher armed with this book should be able to enthuse his charges with the very real relevance of this play to the world which we have bequeathed them 
 Don't let the cover fool you, this is a really great book, easy reading.   Written in plain English, not clinical or overly scientific.  Taught me  alot of things I wasn't aware of before and will use in caring for my  kitty.  I now look at my kitty differently and watch his body language with  new insight. I would recommend it for all cat owners especially first time  owners 
 Dr Smith and the Robot go hog wild, switching personalities and swapping insults.  This is a great episode 
 Senses Fail's debut album, 2004's Let It Enfold You was solid but flawed, competent but ultimately unremarkable. Chugging guitars and harmonizing solos proved to be its strong points but cookie cutter melodic breakdowns and singer Buddy Nielsen's sometimes strained and akward singing didn't lend much in helping the New Jersey based group stand out in the exceedingly crowded second wave screamo scene.  Not content to live in the shadow of Taking Back Sunday, SF's new album is the triumphant result of a band who has focused and refined their strengths, abandoned their weak points and reached adulthood. The underlying potential of the then-inexperienced youths that their previous album alluded to is fully realized on Still Searching: seething with tension and urgency from start to finish, the record is an exhilirating late-night ride down a highway of shredding riffs, melodic choruses and explosive high-tempo drumwork. Nielsen's vocals are right on target, aided by concise, razor-sharp lyricism while the addition of former Midtown guitarist Heath Saraceno has opened a door to high-energy guitar dynamics, dramatic scale progressions and 80s heavy metal guitar solos.  All of Still Searching's songs bleed seamlessly into one another, from the melodic hardcore opening assault of The Rapture and Bonecrusher (possibly the most ridiculously awesome song title ever) to the beautifully somber melodies of the album's finale Negative Space/The Priest and the Matador.  Still Searching is the finished product of five young musicians who have finally found their stride and has the potential to make fans of listeners and critics unimpressed with 2004's Let It Enfold You 
 This is their most political work to date. I would recomend this one. Not as good as Pokinatcha but it is worth the price. Relive MxPx's glory days with Teenage Politics 
 I saw this many years ago and was happy to finaly find it on DVD. This is a who's who of film history. What a cast of hopeful and promising talent. I Loved the guy perspective, something you didn't see much of back then. Mickey Rourke was looking good! 
 We gave this to my son on his 1st birthday in January, even after I read some reviewers complaints about the balls being hard to pound through.  But I thought it looked interesting, so we tried it anyway.  Yes, the balls are too hard for a 1 year old to pound through.  My solution was to use a utility knife to carve down the small bumps in the ball holes so it was easy for him to pound them in with the palm of his hand.  Mind you, this took me all of 2 minutes to do.  He loved it then and he loves it still.  He plays with this toy several times a week even after 9 months.  
 The picture of this DVD may not be the perfect one (which is a pity) but it is definitely worth watching. This is one on those rare films which prove that a long and complicated book can be filmed. Everything... from actors, who gave some outstanding performances, to sets, is almost exactly as I imagined it while reading the novel. It is not just a romantic story as it is shown in the other film versions, but a very serious, tragic social drama. This film is by far the best adaptation of the great novel 
 Being from the South, I love to hear the songs I used to hear as a child growing up in Tennessee. This is a must-buy 
 Watching this movie brought something of a bittersweet smile to my face as i was in a crazy on-and-off relationship with a woman just like Asia Argento's "Beatrice" character.  The performances and the soundtrack are top-notch and though the pacing of the film is a bit slow in spots, it's not too much of a detriment to the film and even serves the tension between the leads. the film is, at heart, a romance after all and it'd be a shame if they had rushed things.  If you want to see a neat little portrait of love both on and over the proverbial razor's edge, do yourself a favor and check this movie out  
 This is a great book.  my 1st book by Bodine and I love it.  Its like she is sitting with me telling me the story.  I highly recomend it 
 When this book came in the mail and I started looking through it I was absolutely thrilled.  It provides a great overview of the yoga tradition by a scholar-practioner with over 30 years experience studying and practicing.  I have similar books that cost much more than this and they are good, but not necessarily as readable as this volume.  In brief, this book covers the scope of yoga and lays a foundation for an overview of the various branches of yoga.  In talks about the history of the yoga tradition and does so in an engaging way, even if you aren't a big history buff.  In my opinion, it provides just the right amount of detail.  This title also looks at the yoga tradition within Buddhism and the relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism.  It also helps the reader to sort out all the various sacred texts, how they are related to each other and even provides sample readings.  The treatment of the classic yoga, the post-classical period and the flowering of the tradition is interesting and informative.  It also talks about tantric traditions and modern movements and scholars such as Sri Aurobindo.  The author also provides a great framework and organizes all of this information in an easy and enjoyable read.  If you have ever been confused over the historical details of the various yoga traditions, the overlap or relationships between them, this text will set you on the right path.  It also has an excellent glossary, comprehensive index and an above average bibilography.  For about $20.00 this book delivers a lot of value.  I recommend it without reservation to anyone interested in the evolution of yoga at any level of practice 
 This is an excellent "boot camp" for learning to read. It's rigorgous, but if you complete the exercises, you *will* learn to read. It's generally very easy to understand and is chock full of exercises. This isn't one of those "pay 20 bucks for a 40 page book that you'll be done with in a week." It's thorough and very economical. I've been consistantly working in this one for 3 months and it's greatly sharpened my skills. The only thing I think that could make it better would be an accompaniment CD. But this one gets 5 stars easily.   If you want to learn to read, buy this book and be prepared to work. 
 This book will be most beneficial for readers who need a foundational knowledge on this topic; those who are about to enter the Army and Ranger training, or for their families.  The book starts at the very beginning of the process and then works its way through basic, and eventually to all the phases of Ranger training (RIP, 75th, Ranger School, Beyond).  It has no personal recollections.  Rather, it focuses primarily on the steps and types of training the Rangers go through.  I would recommend this book as a starting point for those who are less familiar with the terminology or the training structure of the Army and the Rangers.  Begin by reading this book, and then pass it on to your family members who would surely like to know more about where you are headed in the coming months.  By reading this book, you will be much more prepared for some of the more in depth titles which cover this topic.  After reading this book, If you would like the first-hand, personal accounts of Ranger School, I suggest these two: "Ranger School: No Excuse Leadership" (by Brace E Barber), "The Coveted Black and Gold" (by John D Lock)  If you still want more information and are prepared to get in depth, the manual contains an abundance of information.  This material is in outline form, very matter-of-fact, and often times dry.  I do recommend it as well though: "Army Ranger Handbook" (DOD Manual, SH 21-76 
 I am the parent of an 11-year-old boy with Asperger's Syndrome, or high-functioning autism (diagnosed at 5). We have struggled mightily in recent years, despite reading virtually everything out there on Asperger's (God bless Tony Attwood!), and have been perplexed as to how to address the ADHD symptoms my son displays. I couldn't understand (nor could any doctors) why ADHD treatment failed him, and often seemed to backfire and produce an opposite of the desired result. I found this book very enlightening. I think that the possibility that ADHD and autism spectrum disorders are part of the same continuum is quite feasible. Nowhere does the book say that they are the SAME disorder. I have 3 nephews who are autistic (all brothers), and even thought they fall under the general category of "autism", they have some very differnt behaviors from one another. So to say that ADHD CANNOT be "related" to autism (as some reviewers have claimed) becuse some behaviors are different is fautly reasoning, in my opinion. The term "continuum" implies that there are a wide range of behaviors, different with each child based on their intensity and a child's personality. If I've learned anything about autism over the years, it's that you cannot put autistic children in a "box" in terms of their behaviors; this is one thing that makes the disorder so difficult to understand.  I especially liked the section of this book that covers medication. The author (becuase she is not a doctor) does not attempt to deal with this herself, but has a specialist address meds. After many trials of Ritalin-based meds and Strattera with my son, we always got a more hyper, frazzled child. The book suggested that perhaps because many children with autism have "amplified" senses (my words), a little medication will go a long way. We cut my son's medication down to a quarter of what we'd originally tried, and saw improvement right away. So I guess I tend to lend some credence to the author's ascertations. I'd been lost in the topsy-turvy world of Asperger's vs. ADHD (and whether my son had BOTH, or if they were related)for a very long time, and while this book does not lend any conclusive answers (and doesn't claim to), it certainly gets the debate going, and offers some preliminary proof that they may be realted. Autism is so little understood, that I welcome the kind of research done by Ms. Kennedy. She does not have a degree in neurology, nor psychology, but she is thouroughly well self-taught (as all parents of a child with autism need to be!). I feel that this book has helped to at least direct our path of treatment with my son, and for that I am grateful 
 This book is written by six renowned professionals in digital lighting field. Even you are not a shader programmer, chaper 1 and 13 show the  aesthic architecture of lighting composition and tell us the beauty of  'Photosurrealism'. The depth of each paper is just amazing and you can find  more beautiful tecnical information from other papers written by the same  authors 
 The thing I like about this book is the condensation of a lot of wisdom into a small space. Stressed out at the office  or school or just plain stressed out. This book is small enough to keep with you at all times. What a lifesaver 
 I first saw this movie some years ago but only seriously started reading about Shakespeare, his life and times since then. Recently I had the opportunity to see the movie again, this time on DVD. The movie, although an imaginative creation, is well rooted in historical realities. Shakespeare was a commercial artist in commercial theatre, Shakespeare's plays were the popular entertainment of his day, the City of London regularly threatened the 'low brow' theatre entertainment industry with closure, Shakespeare often wrote parts for his favourite actors and his theatre's stars. All these aspects are illustrated in this rollicking screen play. And it leaves us with the question, surely Shakespeare must have been in love to write of love so passionately.   This irreverent production is actually uplifting. Shakespeare was probably the greatest artist of all time, but he wasn't an inhabitant of some ethereal Mount Olympus, he and his work is down to earth. That's what makes him and his work great 
 A Very accurate,detailed informational book for anyone interested in the world of Flight.  This is a real winner!  I am amazed that so much information can be covered so well.  Every Student Pilot should have a  copy. Great reading for Certificated pilots too.  An appreciated gift for  the hopeful and future pilots 
 I first read this short novel when I was about 12 years old. Talk about mind-blowing. It never occured to me that people could have two heads, or be the heroes of a book! Or that a gigantic, self-contained spaceship could be so long in space that the inhabitants have forgotten they are _on_ a spaceship, and instead think it's the entire universe. I have no idea what happened to my first paperback copy. I do miss it. Wherever it's at, I hope some other 12-year-old has stumbled upon it 
 Most of the news we see every day is favored toward showing the use of guns as bad.  Whether this is because of a media plot to condition the public against guns, or because, in general, the people who work for the mainstream media are horrified by guns is not the point.  What this book does is give us the other side of the debate, a side that needs to be heard. Anyone who is caught by the day to day onslaught of the media bias against guns, but has an open mind and thinks they should have both sides of the story, should read this book.  Anyone who instinctively knows that guns are  the basis of all the freedoms we enjoy as Americans and would like a better understanding of that, should read this book. Anyone else, it will be a waste of your money. 
 Having had the joy of devouring my share of Tosacnini's ice cream, I was not disappointed by Gus' storytelling. What a treat it would be to spend a few hours eating his ice cream and listening to his stories on a regular basis!!! I can even imagine Gus on NPR with his own "Ice Cream Talk" show to match the other Italian guys who entertain us with stories in between solving car riddles. Way to go Gus 
 Although I'm happy with my purchase of these Oral replacements, I have to admit they do leave me feeling raw in my area when used for more than 5 minutes.  While they're no match for the original, they still get the JOB done 
 Who would think of reading a dictionary straight through, and for laughs? And who would have thought of writing one that anyone would want to? This "future dictionary", like all good utopian and dystopian literature, is a mordant comment on our age. Ostensibly published at some distant point in the future --  perhaps 100 years from now or more, judging from some of the entries -- the dictionary consists mostly of invented words, and invented definitions of familiar words. Some of it is slightly absurdist, some of it reflects a broad critique of the state of our culture, and some of it is a scalpel-edged swipe at the outrages of our current administration. The 150 or so writers who contributed entries for the book obviously had a great time. It is hard to imagine that they were not smiling to themselves as they wrote their definitions, just as it is hard to imagine any reasonably conscious American failing to smile as he or she reads them. Art and ideas can have consequences in the larger social and political arena, and the creators of this book obviously hope to have an impact. Whether or not it contributes to the outcome on November 2, though, this is a terrifically well conceived and well executed piece of work. 
 Kagemusha is not a 5 star movie.  It is a big step down from Ran (which is very similar in many aspects, but has a great story) and Seven Samurai (a very different and more comedic, earlier movie by Kurosawa).  Kagemusha has two major problems.   The story is quite simplistic, a big problem with a three hour movie.  Incredible visuals and excellent production quality carry much of the movie; there are a few really great scenes, as can be expected of any Kurosawa movie.  But the second issue pushes this movie well into 4-star territory, and that is the ludicrous final battle.  There's a lot worth remembering in Kagemusha, but the crazy ending, unfortunately, sticks in the mind.    The Criterion edition is of excellent quality.  The transfer and sound quality are first-rate, and the additional material is interesting and well done.  Add-ons cannot make a 4-star movie, even so, into a 5-star experience.  There are many positive aspects to Kagemusha, and any Kurosawa fan will be happy with this DVD set.  But for those new to Kurosawa, I strongly recommend Ran or Seven Samurai instead 
 This is an extremely useful dictionary for an English as Second Language learner like me that has okay vocabulary and speaking ability but often doesn't know exactly how to express myself under some contexts.  The dictionary cover mundane topics like "placing a telephone order for pizza", but I don't see that as drawbacks.  Quite on the contrary, the book becomes so useful right because the topics and approriate expressions are very handy and can be applied everyday 
 I am a total addict of Leslie Sansone's Walk Away programs - I had many exercise videos, but never stuck to anything until I found her energizing, fun, and most of all easy workouts.  In her personal, talking-to-you-like-a-best-friend style, Leslie shows you how regular exercise benefits you in all ways from your health to your body to your mind and then presents her easy to follow basic workout which consists of three walking steps that are interchanged and sometimes modified while doing the program.    There is no dieting in this program!  She is a strong proponent of getting up and moving to better your life and shows it here by offering a few modifications you can make to your way of eating to help you lose weight, but no real diet, which I think is great!  It helps to show that the real health factor is getting the exercise you need, not feeling deprived of the food you want which is why many diets fail.  She has many success stories to motivate you peppered throughout the book and closes with a discussion about how stress affects your life and how you can beat it through exercise.    I love Leslie!  She is personable, motivating, and a great teacher - I am forever grateful to her for getting this former couch potato, at-home mom to stick to an exercise routine that I know will always benefit my life 
 Basically, works on Twombly seem to come and go out of print, and become rather pricey collectors items quickly. This book contains an excellent selection of reproductions, including foldouts, of all phases of his career. The only thing that prevents this from being a five star book is the rather pedestrian (although well researched) text, in the usual obfuscating artspeak that passes for deep insight today. The out of print Varnadoe book from the major restropective of the 90's has a far more lucid outline of the works in question...but, really, you're probably buying the book for the reproductions anyway, and there are plenty of them, including some nice full page close up details of the often massive works. Not an inexpensive book, but well worth it for anyone interested in this "painter's painter" works 
 We are assigned this book in our AP US History class. During our class discussions, some people "disagree" with Degler. I ask myself: How is anyone in the position to disagree with a man who has studied history their whole life? Its beyond me. Degler is an absolute genious! 
 The book is accessible to non-academic readers and perfect for college courses in ethnic studies, women's studies, cultural studies, political science, and others. Its primary goal is to expose and analyze globalization's exploitation of poor women, mostly in labor and migration; a secondary goal is to expose and analyze most academics' misunderstandings of this exploitation, a misunderstanding that, according to the closing argument by editor Aguilar, practically re-colonizes the already exploited. Exploitation on all continents and several island nations is covered. But the tone is not desperate and resigned. Rather, the writers here advocate a committed and informed urgency. One contributor argues that "international solidarity is necessary" in the work of ending the exploitation of impoverished women, but she insists that her "global vision" is realizable. 
 Graves great monument to Mythography. It demonstrates genius in what at first seems outlandish interpretations of the ancient bards and druids. His leanings on history, such as asserting (like the all the old oral traditions) that the Celtic/Druidic people came from displaced Bronze Age Aegean/Middle Eastern/and African clans is correct,(actually Druidism is responsible for the widespread cults of Bronze Age Europe which devolved into Greek Myth) and it serves him well in his discussion on poetry and the immortal sources of poetry, as well as explaining that the origin of the Modernistic inability at poetry lay within the dullness of the inherited Classical mode. It is understandible that Irish scholars do not want to be associated with mediterranian cultures, and so they hate Graves work, and they cant come up with a better theory concerning the bardic riddles. The first reviewer above is not a mythographer like me, does not understand that Graves' subject is poetry, and whether or not he got the Ogham right or not makes not ahoot of difference. His analysis of New Grange is rather advanced. Anyone interested in the expression of the poetic power in primordial man, be he a Christian or a Pagan, should read this, although some research into basic Greco-Roman and Irish mythology is required.  
 Having found myself a little out of depth as regards people needing release from pain and stress, I have found the practicality of this book invaluable. It has opened my eyes to understand a lot more of the history of art therapy, and the exercises are helpful. I found the pictures included also enable one to grasp some of the concepts within the text and the layout of the book makes it exciting reading 
 Shade is a strange, and beguiling novel. Beautifully written, with a mysterious, disparate undertone, the story combines timeless images of Hardyesque rural Irish landscapes with the horrors of the Great War. Oblique and multi-layered, Shade is part gruesome murder mystery, part mysterious fable, and part evocative love story that effortlessly brings the world of early twentieth century Ireland vividly to life.  The viewer will certainly be challenged when reading this novel, as the structure is unconventional and the writing is often dense and heavily descriptive. Author, Neil Jordan - who has made a career out of making provocative movies - writes with such love, and affection for his daunting landscapes that the novel is impossible not to admire.   Shade is about four young friends whose lives are inevitably shaped by the devastating effects of World War 1 and by the beauty of their home in Drogheda, a rural town in Ireland, next to the Boyne River. The novel effectively contrasts the horrors of the conflict in the Dardanelles with the ever-restless motions of the river as it "cuts new meadows" on its way to the sea.   The novel begins with the spirit of the fifty-year-old Nina Hardy, describing how her gardener and best friend George, has brutally, and clumsily murdered her.  The murder seems inexplicable, and the motivation remains unclear as George, a survivor of the Great War, was happily living and working for Nina. Nina, who grew up in the enormous, Anglo-Irish Baltray House on the Boyne River's northern bank, has just returned to the house after forty years of achieving fame as an actress.   Nina is determined, with the help of George, to rebuild the family home in which she was once happy. But George has a history of mental problems and has previously been an inmate of the psychiatric hospital of St Ita's in Portrane. There's obviously a connection between Nina and George, but the relationship remains vague and somewhat indistinct. Switching to the early 1900's, the narrative then focuses on idyllic childhood of the two as they are growing up along the mudflats of the river Boyne, with Gregory, Nina's half-brother, and Janie, George's sister.   George and Janie have both grown up in near poverty, but they find their friendship with Nina and Gregory exhilarating, and the fun and games of childhood soon lead to adult love. A fall from a large Tower leaves Nina and George somehow connected by their mutual injuries, and when George awakes from a six week coma, he seems disparate and detached, and somewhat jealous of the "ideal" relationship that Nina shares with her half-brother.    Shade is all about the shades that history plays in life. Themes of love and art are symbolically woven into the story through the lives of the main characters. Growth, birth and death, are things frozen in the moments we perceive them, like a perfect picture, understandable and interchangeable. Nina is like a ghost of the past filling the narrative with almost stream of consciousness-like images as the pieces of the puzzle are steadily put together for the reader. Shade is a fascinating portrait of history where the hidden threads linking childhood and adulthood are forever linked and are perpetually influential. Mike Leonard December 04  
     My book, "Saying it out loud" was very interesting. It was interesting because during the time that I read this wonderful book I realized how unfair life can be. By this I mean that you might have someone very special that you love but that person might not stay with you forever. Relating to the book, a 19-year-old girl Susan has her mother struggling for her life in the hospital. Her mother is in the hospital due to a brain tumor. One day Susan went to visit her mom and make her company like any other person would do. A week later she went to go visit her mother, Sarah at the hospital. Later that afternoon Dr. Lawrence walked in the room. She then talked to Susan about her mother's critical condition. The Dr. said that her mom's tumor was the size of an apple and was unfortunately increasing its size. She then said that her mom would have to be taken into surgery in order to remove the monster in her mother's head. Susan was very nervous and scared but she had hope. She knew the surgery would be successful and that her mom was going to be better soon. Mrs. Lawrence then gave Susan the date when her mother was going to be operated. It was a week from the present day. The week had passed and Susan was ready for the upcoming challenge. As Susan sat patiently in the lobby imagining her mom and herself together having a great time. Dr. Lawrence then interrupted Susan's thoughts. She had a disappointed and guilty look on her pale face. She then told Susan the terrible news. The Dr. then explained to her what had happened. "We lost your mother during surgery. She lost a lot of blood and the tumor was too big for us to handle. There wasn't even a little possibility of you mother surviving." As Susan threw her self on the ground she began to cry as loud as she could from the bottom of her heart. Unfortunately Susan lives on her own as she remembers the great times she spent with her mother, Sarah. 
 Skyke Edwards IS gone....which is undeniably sad. She had a voice that melted your ears and heart, and really carried the songs home. Ross and Paul Godfrey STILL provide excellent beats and rhythms, however, and the new substitute for Skye, Daisy Martey, does more than an acceptable job with the vocals. She's clearer, and though I don't like her voice as much, she's still got the soul required to carry these songs through the ether to your head.   I just found that out Daisy was replaced for live performances, by Jody Sternberg. I don't think the brothers ever truly found a replacement for Skye- my aunt lives in D.C, and she's seen this crew a few times, and she has the opinion that Skye was probably the best- but the beats are tight on this album, same as on "Trigger Hippy"- so the debate over vocals is really a personal preference. I personally like Charango. They bring in a few new rappers- Pace Won does his bit on the title track, and a few others, like Slick Rick (on Women Lose Weight) does an ok job. I still love the Brother's beats, as always. They really make this album.   It's a different Morcheeba, but give it a shot. "What New York Couples Fight About" is a great track, and "Undress Me Now" really highlights Martey's smooth voice. "Public Displays of Affection" has possibly the best beat in a electronica song I've heard in a while. "Get Along" almost had me believing Skye was still there. *Sniff. Oh well.   Not a bad record, by ANY means. 
 I bought the Laura Mercier Kit: Mini Glaces with six glaces including: champagne glace, rose glace, bare beige glace, ambre rose glace, petal glace and violet glace.   My favorite was Rose, but all of the colors are very beautiful. I also have a full size of Melon, another of my favorites. While the colors are beautiful, provide lots of shine and are long wearing, they are very sticky. MAC Lip Glass is much stickier, so if you don't mind that, they might be right for you. Also, the good thing about the kit is that you get to try lots of different colors, but the tubes are quite small, with a steep price. So, if you are willing to put up with a sticky gloss and a high price tag in exchange for some of the most beautiful colors, this might be the right gloss for you. 
 A great overview of just about everything Jewish there and how we relate and survive in the gentile world.  I think that every religious faith should probably have a book like this.  David and Rabbi Ted left me wanting more which is exactly what the book wants 
 Series of Unfortunate Events Book #2 the Reptile Room  By: Lemony Snicket The Book Series of Unfortunate Events Book 2 the Reptile Room By: Lemony Snicket, was about 3 orphans called the Baudelaire's. The oldest is called Violet she loves to invent things. The middle child was Klaus, he loved to read books, and Sunny was the youngest she was teething so biting was her favorite thing to do. Their parents had died in a terrible fire and they had gone to live with count Olaf who was after their enormous fortune. They realized he was evil. So they went to live with there uncle, his name was Montgomery Montgomery yes his first name was the same as his last. The person who was managing them and their money was Mr. Poe. He dropped them off and said he'd be back with the bags in a few days. Uncle Monty had a love for snakes, he wanted to take the Baudelaire's to Peru, so he hired an assistant named Stephano, He looked a lot like Count Olaf. After a week or so there they realized they did not totally like Stephano so the ripped up his ticket. A few days later they found uncle Monty dead, Stephano aka. Count Olaf grabbed the kids and were on there way to Peru when they bumped into Mr. Poe, and realized Stephano was count Olaf, and were taken away by Mr. Poe. This book was very exiting to read there was always something going on, right as you thought it was going to be boring it got interesting. Around the middle of the book I felt like I was actually in the book because there was so much interesting things I got very attached.The conflict in this book was different than most other books, It was stephano and the orphans both hated eachother, so there was always tons of action going on and I liked it. Lemony snicket was very descriptive about his charcters it is very easy to picture them in your head and they seemed very realistic because they had traits just like a regular person. The books ending was alittle satisfying and unsatifying because the ending was the same as all the other books Ive read in this series but it was satisfying because the orphans got away safely.  The authors voice is very good he describes things very clearly and very well, they are also very easy to understand. The author uses vocabulary in an interesting way because, he will pause the story for a second and define the word, that makes the words easy to understand and easier to follow. Some characteristics about the author arehow he defines words like I said already, and something bad always happens that you can never figure out. The author always uses dialogue, description and tone on almost every page. Overall he writes very different than all other authors. I would rate this on a scale of 10, a 7. Because even though it was very good I thought this one was a little more boring than than others in the series because I am not a huge reptile fan. If you like reptiles this is your book. I would definitely recommend this book to reptile lovers and anyone that just wants a good mystery. This book can be very interesting or it may not. Even though I'm not a huge reptile fan I still thought it was pretty good and anyone would probably like it. This book is worth it. 
 Love this product. It's easy to use, easy to take along, clean up is a cinch. No worries about what's on the table UNDER the topper. We've had three restaurant employess (different restaurants) ask about the product for their customers with little ones 
 If you own the Nikon Coolpix 4800, this kit is a great buy. You get an extra battery, which you should have anyway, and the case that fits the camera, for close to the price of the battery. This case is perfect for the camera. I got this kit with the camera and went for a 2 month trip with it all. I had room for the spare battery and a spare memory card in the front pocket and enough room in the main pocket for both the camera and battery. I needed to remove the battery because it does not last in the camera, but with this case, that was never a big issue. Also, the case has an easily adjustable strap that allows you to carry it easily. All in all, if you have the camera, in my opinion, this kit is necessary 
 From the beginning to the end was excellent. The music played throughout the movie wasnt scary but funny in a scary twisted way. I think it is a great movi 
 This is so essential probably one of the last masterpieces in hip hop at the time when this was released hip hop was still in what many consider to be the golden era of hip hop, hip hop was young hip hop was fresh and hip hop was not on the radio now days it's almost impossible to go a day without hearing hip hop on the radio on the tv on a billboard were ever hip hop has lost it's flava i feel that hip hop started declining when cats like Puffy realised that it was marketable i remember seeing him doing big Hollywood videos and talking about bling this bling that big rims and hoes (you know the rest) than every rapper jumped on it now days rappers do whatever just to get paid to get an extra buck and nobodys is saying anything intelligent any more no one actually takes time to sit down and right an intelligent rhyme but if they did would these kids even listen? of coarse there is always gonna be that one dude out there pushin' it but hip hop is definatley on a life line and i feel this is the last real masterpiece i heard in hip hop incredible jazzy beats intelligent lyrics CLASSIC now if only he stopped working with Kanye than he might be able to drop another classic.  p.s I also reccomend LIKE CHOCOLATE FOR WATE 
 This is a small childlike story book, based on the idea that every dog/cat has a angel to watch over them. I'm a big animal lover and have lost many special dogs and cats over the years. The book is a very sweet touching story of the bond between human and dog with cute artwork photo's that capture the heart. I also bought the "cat" version of this book and it's just as lovely. I will buy it for all my friends.If you want a more factual Bible based book I also recommend the book "Do Dogs Go to heaven" by M. Jean Holmes..Both are great books and offer much comfort and hope to all of us who miss our special fur babies 
 I discovered Gary Soto's poetry in a public library in Nebraska. Then I read his short stories, my favorite being "Baseball in April." Like his poetry, these stories are beautiful in that they reveal a child's inner thought life; they also show the challenges that teenagers go through.  Soto takes us back to his childhood in California. The stories occur in sunny Fresno, which is in the Central Valley. The characters, dilemmas, and emotions that he evokes are so real that I often read them over saying, "Yes, I remember feeling like that."  I mostly read adult literature but have been reading a lot in young adult literature, because I often forget what it was like to be a young boy. Soto has a gift for recalling these events and making them come alive again. I've read this collection three times and have read all of Soto's poetry. I hightly recommend "Baseball in April," as well as the poetry collection "Black Hair."   Also recommended: The Gospel of Arni 
 Right off, this endearing indie about a train-watching dwarf (Peter Dinklage) who unexpectedly inherits an isolated train station in the boonies of New Jersey deserves every single award it won at Sundance and every morsel of praise I can heap on it.  Peter Dinklage is a marvel in this, his first big lead role, as his character Fin McBride slowly comes to terms with life, death, loneliness, and the true meaning of friendship. Director Thomas McCarthy lets his story unfold in due time, and allows each actor live and breathe their characters. The supporting cast, led by Bobby Cannavale as the super-chatty hot-dog/coffee cart jockey Joe and Patricia Clarkson as the depressed artist Olivia, is absolutely top-notch. Without sounding pretentious - The Station Agent is great cinema.  Off the subject: say what you will about Miramax and producer Harvey Weinstein - the 'independent' studio has given filmmakers an amazing outlet to create some very, very good movies. I wish the rest of Hollywood was as innovative and creative.. 
 Overall was very good...there were some technical errors howeve 
 For the first time, my son has truly enjoyed story time/reading.  I can't explain it, but he just adores these Little Bill books.  We have tried EVERYTHING to get him interested in reading and listening to stories.   Maybe a 4 1/2 yr. old can simply relate!  We all like the values being  taught as well as the illustrations.  It is a real joy to see and hear our  son "read" us Little Bill stories. What a blessing these  stories/books have been to our family. Thank you Bill and Varnette 
 Pros: Reasonable price, immportant features, came w/ batt's, virtually instant set-ups and easy.  Excellent versatility viz. PPt, on-screen demos, signal range, size, user-friendliness, teaching tool, etc.   Cons: Built-in F5 and ESC controls could be more precise. Easy to not hit correctly.  Reconnecting the Hiro link to computer was very difficult once unlinked 
 As a personal trainer, I eat alot of protein - 250-300 grams a day. I know my protein. This is the best. It mixes well, it has both whey isolate and whey concentrate, contains a complete amino acid complex, very few carbs, and tastes great! Other brands lack in at least one of these areas, and if they are equal, are much more expensive. I recommend this brand and flavor to all my clients 
 I absolutely adored these books... When the Wind Blows and The Lake House.  Truthfully, I could not put them down, and am in the process of reading them the third time since my birthday, which was March 6th.  I do feel that he could have been a little more descriptive of their appearance, because at times, at least in When the Wind Blows, it was a little shady in how it described how the wings worked.  Other than that, though, I felt this book was completely awesome, and will always be loyal to the bird-kids 
 This all-Spanish handbook for parents with new babies will prove essential for any concerned about a child's health. Manual Pediatrico appeared first in English; the Spanish edition provides essential health information at a glance for parents unversed in medical care; and should be a mainstay of  any Spanish-speaking home with children 
 The very well written story of one of history's most famous battles.  Recommended highly for those interested in not only the event itself, but in current questions of both personal leadership and the politics of war. Cadets at West Point should read this book. For that matter, U.S. businessmen who tend to read shallow tomes on what it takes to be a leader should step up in class and read about Henry V, as presented here by this talented and deeply informed English writer 
 Thoughtful,sincere,passionate without the evangelism of the ecoterrorists. The author aggregates the information indicting the food and dairy industry as purveyors of disinformation that has defined the deplorable state of nutrition in the United States. This book validates what I intuitively believed about nutrition during a career as a practicing physician. This book also aligns environmental concerns with the global concept of health care in contrast to the usual commentary and beliefs about medical care driven by costly therapeutic interventions supported by commercial interests and culminating in little added benefit to health care outcomes 
 I am amazed at the different remedies found in this book! Most all of them work well. I have tried out a few and recommended a few to friends. I will always keep this book near when an ailment arrises.  This book was recommended to me by another Author that is also available up here on amazon with his Novel for sale called, "The Masconi's".  The Authors name is R.H. Tuttle Jr. and he said to try this book for natural remedies because he recently purchased it and after reviewing it said that he would strongly recommend this book to any one.  I gave this book a try and like he said the book is filled with home remedies for relief and different ways of getting rid of different ailments.  I thank then author of this book and I also thank R.H. Tuttle Jr. for reccomending this book to me.  All the best-  Jimmy 
 Roby Webb, MS, and associate editor of Diabetes Forecast, shows us that food can be healthy, good, quick and an inspiration for cooks and guests to have fun.  It's a comprehensive book that includes nutrition analyses, what's in the cupboard, meal planning, kitchen organization, what to buy, meal prep and time-saving ideas.  I found a great Shrimp Gazpacho and Herbed Crab Sandwich to add to my summer repertoire 
 I like Kid Koala, but I would probably hate him if I was a DJ, in the same way that a marginally talented musician would hate a criminally gifted child prodigy.  He did everything on this record by hand, i.e., no samplers or loops, which makes an additional testament to the incredible technical skill displayed in this album (which barely lasts longer than a sitcom).  In an interview he said that this cd was his place to put all the stuff he couldn't use at parties, which is evidently a whole friggin lot of stuff.  I guess you could sum this album up by noting three things: obscure vocal samples and such, feverish scratching and manual looping chops that make my non dj wrists hurt, and enough strong head bobbing beats to fill...something small.  It has a good sense of humor and a fiercely unique sound which may grow thin with repeated listening, but the gimmick is welcome if you approach it wanting to be amazed by the unusual showoff stylings of one of the world's best djs.  But if you want the usual fast rhythmic stuff over loud hip hop beats listen to Q-Bert 
 You just can't keep a good man down. After sleeping through last year's rather pedestrian cover album Studio 101 it seemed that Paul Weller had finally reached the bottom of his creative well. In fact, the quality of his albums had been on a slow downward spiral since 1994's Wild Wood, so it's a pleasant surprise then that Weller has produced his best album in a decade. It's a return to the 3-minute guitar pop songs of his Jam days mixed with the funky soul that Weller has long established as one of his strengths. At still only 47 years old it seems "The Modfather's" days on top are long from numbered. 
 Firstly, I am a Spiritualist medium, healer, teacher, lecturer and minister. I am currently the Associate Pastor of the Colby Memorial Temple in Cassadaga, Florida. So I admit to coming to this review a bit biased in Maggie's favour.  I gave this book four instead of five stars because I felt it was somewhat unbalanced. And from the other reviews, I feel justified. Ms. Stuart has given us a tremendous picture of life in the last half of the American Victorian Era. There were many issues facing women and Spiritualism got into the middle of many of them. All the reviewers read that Maggie debunked Spiritualism, but none of them seem to read that she recanted that confession and told us why. Also remember that many of the norms and mores of the time got in the way of her life. She was also tremendously effected by her love for Dr. Kane. Has there never been a young girl confused, coming into puberty? I think not.  Anyway, the book is basically well written. I have already used it as a basis for a Lyceum Lecture(Our version of Sunday School). The greatest value of the book is in its exposing readers to a little known period of American history and the involvement of religion in that period. Other good books are: RADICAL SPIRITS by Anne Braude and TALKING TO THE DEAD, and LILYDALE. Also the truly interested reader would be remiss without reading the HISTORY OF SPIRITUALISM by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. (See my review). 
 It's a shame that such an important and exquisitely written study such as this should be allowed to go out of print.WOTMA was an intergral part of my understanding the Middle Ages and is an engaging read. A must have!PLEASE REPRINT IT FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE STUDENTS!! 
 Podhoretz writes with intimacy and frankness.  His experience as the child of Jewish immigrants growing up in Brooklyn and ultimately becoming a conservative is what should be a logical conclusion of so many more lives than New York peer pressure typically allows.  A great example of someone with the wisdom to get past the elitist hangups of the NYC intelligentsia who instead followed his heart to the truth.  A gentle read, and an overall pleasure 
 This book lays heavy as most coffee table books do.  But it does not weigh  heavy with mass, but with the knowledge and mastery of an American artist  who set the standard for those who strived for excellence.   With an  introduction written by Norman Rockwell, an account of his life and his  works are the focus of this book. The splendid imagery and skillfull and  constructive drawings of the human figure are a favorite to teachers and  students alike.  For the non artist, it is a book filled with wonderful  illustrations that captivate the eye.    A must buy, for any collector or  artist 
 Overall this is a great pocket reference for a new to intermediate PC technician working towards A+ (so therefore does exactly what it says!). However, some of the photos are misplaced (or mislabled). This is fine if you know what the item is supposed to look like, but not so good for the beginner. That is the only reason it lost a star from me. I would suggest tougher proof reading before the next edition. However, I continue to use this book on a day to day basis and think you will find it a very useful resource! Recommended 
 Cary Grant was a Great actor with countless memorable films. Although that this film is not amongst his very best, it is a fun movie with a good plot that may be watch by the whole family with pleasure. It is a war comedy with kids in main roles and one may see some Disney influence. But Grant offers us  one of his typical (in a good sence) perfomance that wilkl satisfy his funs. Enjoy it 
 I did a lot of research for a racket before purchasing this one. One of the reasons I got it is because of the very light weight of the racket. I have a sist which cuts circulation and strength in my swing wrist not allowing me to utilize the full force of my arm during the swings so I had to have a really light weight racket. The other detail to my story is that I am a weaklink and I need a light racket. I am also a beginner player and needed a racket that would bounce off any side of the racket I hit the ball with. This racket is truly a wonderful piece 
 Amateurs of sexy lounge look no further...when it's time to refresh those cocktails, wind down and pump up your night accompanying crew, pop this well balanced soother.Dream like moments should be shared listening to this life loving recording.   It introduces glamorous like vocals (Superficial) and from the first beat, gets your system ready for further moves.: Mig's remix of "Pure" unwinds the intro and prepares the mood, it's "delicate and dancy", "Chocolat" follows through with a stronger tempo and more funkiness, no vocals, just a three step tempo, "I need you in my life" gets clearly clubby and that old style bass line will defo get you pumping by then. "True love" evolves in a more musical note, it has a romantic feel but the beat it still very present, beat which intensifies again with "Keep it coming" (right words...), the vocals gets wavy, it has deep house feel to it. Just great crescendo. "The limit" would perfectly belong in a Kruder&Dorfmeister selection as it gets airy and the repetitive keyboards with distorting sounds has that trip lounge impression. "Big ben" has a jazzy/latin type of guitar in the back, "Losing control" gets savvy and sexy in its vocals, silky roughness of a female, "Sincere", "Got 2 B U" have the same tone again, clubby and sexy. "Could you love me" by now should have your party prancing like top models in every corner of your pad with its heavy and regular beat and a disco like bass. "The power" has a break beat and even funkier singing.    "Always" the finale by the talented Lisa Shaw will leave you saliving for more as it winds down soothingly in its coolness. Lisa just wraps you with her charm and her whispering warmth blends beautifully with the soft easiness of the ensemble.   OK, refresh those cocktails again...and get that music bouncin' 
 Also Nadi is almost as great a narrator as he is a fencer.  The instruction will prove to be a bit wordy for the novice, but this book is an amazing tribute to the sport he lived.  The chilling account of his first duel is worth the price of this book tenfold.  Additionally, there are only a few pictures, but to see them is to see the absolute purest form the human body can attain.  Aldo Nadi was the greatest 
 Chip is being raised in a society that for the most part is organized and has its resources adjusted by computer. There are no fights, no need to shave, and no diseases. Everyone is living at least to 32. What more could one ask for. Then there are in theory a few misfits that haven't been to see their counselors and evidently not taking their medicine. You guest it, Chip is just determined that It is ridicules to have computers determine your life. He at lest does not want them to control his life. This book has many twists and turns. Some you will guess and some you won't. So be prepared.   Naturally working in Information Systems I can not bring my self to enjoy the ending. Now it is fun to compare this work with "Brave new World" ISBN: 0060929871 for attitude and "1984" ISBN: 0451524934 for subterfuge. Others compare with "Logan's Run" ASIN: 0792839692 for the age thing and corrective action. They missed two good ones. They are "Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron" ASIN: 6303801919 for that brain numbing effect and "Gattaca" ASIN: 0767805712 for the genetic thing. 
 Of the glut of wrestlers autobiographys that flood the world, the one that started it all is far and away the best. I've owned this book for years and have read it dozens of times. It never gets any less enjoyable. If youre a wrestling fan, or even if you're not, do yourself a favor and pick this up right now 
 Fifth-grader Amy Prochenko has never been the popular girl in school. In fact, the only thing she's really been, is made fun of, by fellow classmate, and resident popular girl Kaitlyn Walker, along with her group of cronies. But when Sherlock (also known as F-32) comes along, Amy's entire world flips upside down. With Sherlock (an escaped research laboratory dog looking to distance himself from a group of students who plan on dissecting his brain) by her side, Amy feels that the sky's the limit, and that she holds the power to do anything. For, you see, Sherlock is a talking dog. A smart dog. One who knows more than the average fifth grader - aside from some spelling problems. And without Amy's help, he won't be living for much longer. So Amy does what she promises: she takes Sherlock under her wing; and, with the help of two new friends, keeps his existence under wraps, while they determine what would be the best option for the runaway pooch. But when workers from the laboratory begin hanging around Amy and her pals, trying to get as close to the dog they named F-32 as possible, Amy realizes that she may have bitten off more than she can chew, and that the only way to salvage this problem will be to tell the truth. But now that Amy and her friends have gotten mixed up in so many lies, it's hard to go back now. Besides, Amy has found something special in Sherlock. Something she never thought she'd find. A best friend. And a sudden bout of popularity that really knocks her off her feet.  As an animal rights activist, I love the fact that there are others out there who feel the need to bring animal rights issues into children's books, in an attempt to spread the word about dissection, cruelty at circuses, and more. Peg Kehret's SAVING LILLY wowed me a couple of years ago, but the subject matter of Vivian Vande Velde's SMART DOG has wowed me once again. While there is information regarding dissection, and research laboratory's, Velde has kept it at a minimal, and not allowed it to overshadow the overall story revolving around Amy and Sherlock. Sherlock is the best friend you've always wanted - smart, fun, friendly - and putting a face and a character to an animal up for dissection really makes the reader realize the seriousness of the subject. Amy, on the other hand, is a brave, intelligent, kind character; whose friendly nature, and overall loving attitude bring SMART DOG an extra ounce of compassion, and truly make the characters stand out. SMART DOG is a smart book choice for all animal lovers, that will leave its mark in your mind, and heart.   Erika Sorocco Freelance Reviewer 
 First Book I've read from Sandra Brown and it was really great. It was a page turner from beginning to end. I found the book interesting and easy reading. A well written mystery suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. Will not be the last Sandra Brown novel for me 
 I found this book to be well written and an excellent example of how it is possible to turn your own life around if you have the will power to do so.The previouse two books in the trilogy have to be read to fully understand the strength of character that Dave Pelzer must have 
 This book's extensive guide to collectible book pricing is fascinating and valuable in itself, but what I enjoyed even more was the numerous interviews with longtime book dealers. These interviews, sprinkled throughout the book, provide a keen insight into today's out-of-print bookselling and collectibles market. Of course, the experts disagree on some points, but that is all part of the fun -- you get to decide what makes the best sense for you, and apply those ideas to your own book-hunting adventures.  This guide also thoroughly covers genre collecting, the care and repair of books, and includes a glossary and references to many additional sources of information.  So whether you're a book auctioneer, bookshop owner, an online dealer, or simply a lover of collectible fiction or nonfiction treasures, I'd recommend that you read this book from cover to cover and put it on your shelf for future reference. When I read this book a few months ago, I found myself underlining a few paragraphs on nearly every page. It will give you a finer appreciation of how the Internet has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for book collectors and dealers alike.  
 The writting is poetic making the characters real and emphasing their feelings and courage--especially moving is their suffering 
 My favorite illustration is the one where the mother mouse is feeding her son (or daughter?) an impossibly large cheese banquet, much to his/her great delight.  A wonderful book 
 A great guide book for eating while staying healthy and still losing weight.  Easy to follow recipes, delicious and tasty. I always knew that brown rice can be healthy AND yummy!  I would recommend this book for people who love eating but don't want to get fat 
 Wouldn't have taken the chance if they hadn't been on sale, but they fit perfectly and look wonderful on.  Good quality and well-made 
 This is a good case, but i would prefer one that it can be a little bit small, because is bulky. But on the overall, is a very good adquisition for the people that wants to take underwater photography 
 I don't see anything exciting about this book. It was a lackluster shadow of LKH's vamp stories; sort of like Anita Blake on tranquilizers--ELEPHANT tranquilizers.  The voice used for the story--Sookie Stackhouse--was too dry and uninteresting; and I'm not one of those who has a problem with first person narrative. Two of the best series around today, LKH's Anita Blake, and Diana Gabaldon's Outlander, use first person, and they are riveting.  This is just too laid back for me--and I happen to like laid back, which is why Patricia Gaffney and Judith Ivory rate so high on my list of must-haves. But I practically snored through the sex scenes, and the rest of it was just too boring; I never got to like this girl with the should-have-been-funny-but-was-just-weird name.   She thought of herself as the girl everyone else thinks is weird, and by the time I was about a third into the book, I thought she WAS weird. There was just this overall "I'm a dead-end (no pun intended) person, living a dead-end life" feel to the book that I couldn't get past. It was as if she were someone who had given up on life before she even tried it.  I mean, she's a cocktail waitress with no future ambition to be anything else, who ends up taking money for doing something she should have done--Anita would have--for nothing. (And this book does beg for comparisons given its similarity to some aspects of LKH's work. Sadly, it suffers by those comparisons.)  Won't put a spoiler here by saying what she should have done, but she just doesn't come across as someone who really cares for anyone else, or who anyone else really cares about either--not even her own brother. (You get the feeling he's only asking for money for her so he can borrow.)If nobody else cares about her, why should we?   And if she were just a bit more sharp--why not have her ask for the money herself?--she would at least have had some edge to her. Instead, she's an ill-defined, amorphous blob, with no sharp edges, like a no-fat, no-salt diet of English 'cuisine'. Yuk.  Sad to say, the author provides us with absolutely no reason to care about this character. Sookie is nothing special, in character, in intellect, in personality; she's just blah, a loser and too lazy even to care. Worse, she seems to think we won't notice, which indicates she thinks WE'RE losers too. I should like this person? No.  The whole book is the forced interactions of a bunch of characters who seem disconnected from themselves and each other. The characters have no emotional investment in themselves, anyone else, or even much in what's going on; even when they 'rally for war', it's half-hearted and hard to believe (characters that have lived such long and dangerous lives don't have any better idea of how to go about taking out the enemy than what's shown here? Please.). It makes it impossible to invest anything in them yourself.  Even the 'Bubba' thing, which should have and could have been an original and interesting touch, falters in the hands of this writer so that it seems--well, stupid.  I'd had some high recommendations from a few people--should have remembered they also recommended K. MacGregor's Sword Of Darkness and Savannah Russe's Beyond The Pale--for this book. I suppose if your reading tastes aren't very broad or varied, it would seem like a decent read to you. But it never took off at all; despite dramatic situations and the introduction of what should have been but weren't interesting characters, this book was like reading an obituary--so I guess you could say it WAS aptly named. (Sure put me to sleep.*G*)  I try to consider other reading levels when I give a review; there are those of us who have a wider reading experience, and there are those of us who are maybe still in junior high school or such, and just starting out. This is the only reason I give this book 3 and a half stars; I feel that for those whose reading level is junior high school or below, this book might seem pretty good.   But for anyone out of jr. high, I really think this book is more a one to two star read; something you'd read if you had nothing else to read, or (as I did) simply because you told someone else you would; I wouldn't have finished it otherwise.  I can forgive a lot in a writer if they can just give me characters I can care about, and plots or situations that are interesting; sadly, Ms. Harris fails to do either.  I won't be reading any other of her books--unless I get roped into it again. :- 
 Some deadly sins are better than others. Take gluttony. By definition it seethes with excess and over indulgence. And greed, with its inherently selfish motivations, carries no positive overtones whatsoever. How would one depict gluttony or greed in a positive light? Not easily. Twenty first century people, in line with their medieval ancestors, would probably still classify these behaviors as "sins" or at least as "darn bad things". But the other "sins" remain different, and people today would probably only call them "sins" when taken to extreme. Truly, too much anger, sloth, lust, or envy can result in behavior destructive to self and others. But in small quantities they can provide motivation to action or emotional release. Unlike gluttony or greed, each of these remaining sins can be depicted in a positive light when not taken to excess. Pride shares this characteristic. Fatuous overzealous pride makes for a rather unpleasant and potentially self-destructive person. But the right dose of pride can inspire and provide self-worth. Modern pride then swings more to the "less deadly" side of the deadly sin continuum.  Michael Eric Dyson thoroughly explores this "better" deadly sin in five short chapters. He draws on his direct experiences of both racial pride and what he has seen of overwrought nationalism. The former represents a potentially good form of pride (again, if not taken to extreme), the latter demonstrates pride's ugly side spilling over into myopic vanity. Dyson sees both forms at work in today's world.  The first chapter deals with pride from a historical perspective.  Pride once held a notorious spot in the litany of sins. The Greeks, until Aristotle, termed it "hubris" and found it a menace. Much later, Pope Gregory I called it "the root of all evil" and Augustine and Aquinas held equally disparaging views. Pride kept people from God, so went the argument, and opened the door to other sins. Thus, humility became the state in which one fell into grace with the Lord by becoming truly subject (or subordinate). In great contrast to this long tradition, Aristotle held pride in some esteem. Dyson points out the Aristotelian notion of "the proud man... who thinks himself worthy of great things". But this proudness shouldn't stretch too far. Examples of overstretching in the forms of religious fundamentalism, nationalistic arrogance, power, and wealth get discussed.   Dyson then turns autobiographical as he discusses his experience with pride. He is proud of his reading and writing skills, and books helped strenghten his will in hard times. The writings of Melville, Dostoyevsky, Morrison, Solzhenitsyn, Ellison, Baldwin, and Martin Luther King, Jr., and countless others helped lead him to his position today of social critic and ordained Baptist Minister. So Dyson has had some very positive experiences with pride.  The next two chapters juxtapose white and black pride, in that "white pride is often the vice that makes black pride necessary." White pride, often taken for granted and infrequently up for discussion, can lead to self-loathing for blacks. Dyson quotes terms like "whitewishing" and "white water is wetter" as symptoms of white pride successfully squashing out black pride. Other signs include the long struggle between light and dark skinned blacks. Though historically the prejudice fell in favor of lighter skin, Dyson notes that today darker skin has come into vogue. He then discusses his conflicting emotions at the appointments of blacks high up in the Bush administration, feeling proud to have blacks so high up, but simultaneously feeling repulsed by their political views. He has some very nasty words in particular for Condoleezza Rice. With equal venom, he attacks what he calls the "black elite" (e.g., Jack and Jill and the Links), condemning their disdain for lower class blacks while attempting to better the interests of their own kind exclusively. The discussion ends on a happier note with the Oscar victory speeches of Halle Berry and Denzel Washington in 2002, and the rise of Kweisi Mfume (a US Congressman from Maryland now running for the Senate). One of the challenges going forward, Dyson claims, is to not allow white pride to distort or squelch black pride.  In the final chapter, Dyson deals with national pride. Here he attacks those that have disfigured a healthy love of country into narrow minded nationalism in post 911 America. A new form of PC, "Patriotic Correctness", has swept the nation following the fall of the twin towers. This chapter in particular deals with what Dyson sees as "pride gone bad".  This majority of this short book deals with pride mainly from a racial and political perspective. Dyson uses his own experiences of racism and nationalism to frame his arguments. Some of his observations and opinions may jar readers. In particular, supporters of the Bush administration may fulminate while reading the final chapter. But Dyson supports what he calls "critical patriotism", which he thinks needs to thrive for democracy to work. But sometimes relentless pride gets in the way and bats it down as heretical. His final chapter stands as a dire warning of what can happen when national pride runs amok. And it also demonstrates the dual nature of the prickly "sin" of pride. It has the strange power to make the healthy into a destructive force almost without notice.  "Pride" is thick with argument, stories, and criticism. Though not everyone will agree with Dyson's conclusions, he constructs an interesting ride through the subject of pride from certain perspectives. And though the discussion wanders and digresses in places, it always returns to its subject: that bizarre "sin" that no longer seems like a sin, pride 
 Very nice music, "Driftin'" and "Watermelon Man" in  particular.  The alternate takes sound very similar to the master takes,  they're no great shakes in that regard 
 This is a good album for those who are not familiar with destiny's child. The remixed versions of No, No, No, Independent Women and other songs show why they are one of the top girl groups out there today 
 After watching one of these shows I was hooked. Unfortunately I discovered this after it was cancelled. Maybe bad advertising. How come I've never heard of such a fantastic show. Big mistake. I love the characters, music, special effects, plots. Everything was obviously done by a phenomenal team. Its like a great book with the last few pages missing. More Firefly please. 
 This book is a true classic, and most investors would be well-advised to start with this book as they seek to learn more about the process of making their money work for them.  In particular, Graham's book is useful because it recognizes that the universe of potential investments is greater than just stocks - he covers warrants, bonds, etc.    Graham's main point is that investors look at the fundemantals that underly a potential investment to determine the probability of a satisfactory outcome.  Hence, Graham does not focus on macroeconomic factors, but instead, he determines the "intrinsic value" for any investment, hopefully buying well below that value, a concept he calls the "margin of safety."  As some reviewers have noted, this book has been criticized by some thinkers as being out of date.  In particular, most readers should understand that one of the theories that underlies Graham's philosophy, that a stock is worth the aggregate value of its expected dividends (See John Burr Williams' "Theory of Investment Value"), has been modified somewhat by "discounted cash flow" theories.  This means that to some investors, p/e ratios and dividend payouts are de-emphasized somewhat.  To me, this does not mean that Graham's theories lose validity, particularly as concerns the notions of intrinsic value and the margin of safety.  As far as I am concerned, Graham's book is most useful when viewed as a theory about how to invest.  As such, it is a valuable guide, particularly when read in conjunction with Phil Fisher's book "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits" and Marty Whitman and Marty Shubik's book "The Aggressive Conservative Investor."  Another book that readers of the Intelligent Investor might like would be Dreman's "Contrarian Investing: the Next Generation."  A quick warning to prospective readers: at the outset, reading anything by Graham can be somewhat slow going.  I received a copy of this book as a gift years ago, and could not slog through more than 1/2 of it.  It was only years later, after learning more about investing and accounting, that I truly came to appreciate the wisdom contained in this book.  Readers who appreciate The Intelligent Investor might also want to try "Security Analysis," which develops the ideas in the Intelligent Investor in much greater detail, and also sets forth more criteria about how to analyze investments (the chapters on financial statements are particularly useful).  I have reviewed that book (3rd edition) as well, if anyone is interested.  Although it takes some work to make it through this book, one point that readers should understand is Graham firmly believes that it takes work to invest wisely.  He would never encourage investing on tips, momentum investing, etc.  A reader would be well-served to apply himself or herself to investing research with the same diligence that reading this book requires, and I don't doubt they will be rewarded as a result. 
 At times, authors would have the highest regards of their subjects that by the time the books are completed, the biographies of the subjects would differ completly from the real thing.  Despite that David Chatwick was a student of Shunryu Suzuki, and despite that the reverence is there, David interviewed hundreds of people, researched through piles of materials in order to convey to us the person that Shunryu Suzuki was.  Here, he was portrayed as a human being with his own flaws.  As we traced Shunryu's life from his childhood in Japan and subsequently, to America, we would learn of his deep sufferings that moulded him to become the person that he would become later on.  In Japan, he never gotten the recognition that he deserved & right from day one, he was called Crooked Cucumber by his own teacher for his absent-mindedness.  Yet, we are talking about the same Crooked Cucumber that brought Zen into the mainstream, setting up Zen centres in the West, initiated the exchange program between America & Japan, and along the way, captivating people's hearts & souls.  Shunryu always believed in the middle-road & in all people.  He left people to their own discretion to find meanings in their lives & he's only there to guide them when his assistance was needed.  The later part of the book was very heart-moving to read as he was struggling with his own terminal illness & yet, he projected a quiet dignity & strength that a teacher possessed & guided his students till the change-over phase.  In his dead bed, he was still thinking about his students instead about himself.  One can't help but feeling emotional about this book. A times, it's funny, it's sad, it's scary (especially when he had his short temper burst), it's wonderful but isn't that what life is all about?  By reading this book, perhaps, we get a bit of insight about this great teacher but along the way, we get to learn more about ourselves.  A captivating read and highly recommende 
 When Jacqueline Susann saw the finished movie based upon her best-selling novel, she denounced it as a "piece of s**t!"  Perhaps her hopes were a little too high as the book "Valley of the Dolls" (VOD) was called all sorts of things upon its initial release in 1966 (even by it's own editors); then again, one can see how Susann would have been disappointed as the movie is very different from the novel.  The basic outline of the book and movie is the same - three young women, Anne, Neely and Jennifer, face the pressures and demands of fame as their stars rise - but that, and a smattering of dialogue here and there is about the only thing the book and film share.    VOD develops the friendships of the three women; how these characters grow to know one another is something the movie either failed to do or else the director let those scenes end up on the cutting room floor.   We follow reserved Anne, self-destructive Neely and the beautiful, doomed Jennifer on a twenty year journey through their ups and downs, good relationships and bad and by the end, I felt as though I knew them.  The bad news about VOD is that despite having once been a scandalous shocker it hasn't aged well and is now a rather tame drama.  In subsequent decades, writers like Jackie Collins and Judith Krantz pushed the literary limits further than Susann did but, quite honestly, even "Peyton Place", published ten years *before* Susann's novel, remains a page turning pleasure whereas "Dolls" just plods along.  Part of VOD's weakness can be rested on the shoulders of Anne, a real cipher of a character.  We spend a great deal of time on Anne's story and frankly, she isn't all that interesting.  Neely and Jennifer are much more exciting character but Susann concludes Jennifer's story far too early (and believe me, you feel the loss once Jennifer exits the action) and dull, milquetoast Anne, with her 1,000 bad decisions, makes it to the very end.    The good news about this book is how Susann exposes the world of Hollywood, where the pressure to perform and stay thin can destroy a person.  It's common knowledge that Neely O'Hara was most liked based in-part upon Judy Garland, though Susann, like a true professional, denied it.  Sadly, conditions in Hollywood are still very similar though Neely's "dolls" have been replaced by obsessive dieting and anorexia.  Susann also writes well about women's limited options in the era when the book takes place (1945-65) and the consciousness of the female characters anticipates the brewing women's movement.   Despite its shortcomings, "Dolls" is still a good summer beach read, and we're lucky it went back into print in 1997 after being unavailable for years.  Read it, enjoy it ... but stay away from the dolls 
 Buy this for Terrence Mann's performances alone.  His rendition of Falcon in a Dive is filled with passion and power.  Where's the girl is also truly wonderful.  Douglas Sills and Christina Andreas are both perfectly casted and their voices are beautiful in their respective songs.  The ensemble pieces are great too.  But for me, I can't get enough of Terrence Mann's baritone voice and wish he had even more to sing.  Overall, this is a wonderfully composed and scripted musical and we should hear it more than we currently do.  This cast is just perfect 
 I just bought Retread Hair Conditioner today from my local LUSH store and tried it tonight.  My hair was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G after I used it.  After I've read all the reviews about the product, I was still a little skepticle, as I've tried many things that had awesome reviews, but just didn't work with my thick coarse hair.    I shampooed my hair, put in Retread Hair Conditioner, covered my hair with a plastic cap and set a hot towel over it for an hour (dunking the towel in hot water every 15 minutes to 'reheat' it).  Rinsed out the conditioner and didn't use anything else on my hair (I usually have to put in anti-frizz serum).    The first thing I noticed was the shine... what a HUGE difference.  Even my boyfriend said there was something different, but he couldn't quite figure it out.  Retread Hair Conditioner left my hair super soft too.  And you don't even need to use that much.  Now for the bad....  the smell (that's why it's not 5 stars)!  I know some people say they love it and some people say they hate it, and I really think that's the way it is... you either hate it or love it.  I actully hated it.  My boyfriend took one whiff (and thought it smelled like old soggy towels) and offered to drive me back to LUSH to return it because he thought it was 'old'.  Another reviewer said it smelled like 'barnyard' and I think that's the best way to describe it.  You do get used to it (and luckly the smell fades as your hair dries), but for me, the smell was too much.    I will buy again because I absolutely love the results, but I will only use Retread Hair Conditioner when I know I will be home the next day to spare others from the smell 
 This is an excellent devotional book, a single page for morning and a single page for evening each day.  It draws the reader into a deeper appreciation of Christ and what we have in Him.  Often the entries are convicting, but only in a way that tends to lead toward greater -- and happier -- submission to the Lord.  Reflections on short Scriptural excerpts are deep and insightful.  I've been using it for four years and never find it old or unfruitful 
 I received the book very fast. The book is in excellent condition as described. I am happy with this purchase 
 This is by far the best football movie/documentary I have ever seen.  It is hard to believe that this story is actually true; in fact if I didn't see it with my own two eye I would not believe it.  This film was brilliantly filmed and beautifully done!  If you like high school football or even football in general this movie is for you!  I highly recommend this film to everyone! You wont be able to leave you seat!

 This workout is an excellent follow-up to Ana Caban's first workout, Pilates for Beginners. The length of the workout and the intensity of the exercises was perfect. I really enjoy Ana's commentary during the workout and I think she is one of the better pilates instructors available on DVD. The range of motion covered and the explanations for them are very helpful and I developed a much better ability to perform exercises like 'Teasers' (one of the more difficult Pilates exercise) and many others. I also really love the Energy Boost workouts on this and the beginners DVD because if I have a busy day ahead of me, I will do the fifteen or twenty minute energy boost workout and be set for the day, even if I don't have time to do a whole long workout. 
 I used this recording to practice for a Presentation of Fiddler of the Roof. It was great music to listen to and work from. I found it to be the best recording of Fiddler available

 The story is about a boy that lives in a town called Centerburg, where Route 56 meets 56A. There are six stories about Homer Price and the people in his town. My personal favorite story is the "The Doughnuts." It is about his Uncle Ulysses lunchroom and the gadgets and the outrageous inventions in there. One day something goes wrong.    Some of the characters are the sheriff, the boys, Aggy, Uncle Ulysses, Uncle Telly, and Miss Terwiller. Some of the not so bright characters are the sheriff who talks backwards a lot. Uncle Telly, Miss Terwiller, and the sheriff all collect string. Also Uncle Ulysses owns a lunchroom that a lot of people go to. Homer Price's family owns a tourist camp where people can say for the night. The sheriff spends most of his time down at the barbershop, and plays checkers.  Great book! 
 It took me a lot of years to get around to reading this book, and it was on the recommendation of one of my daughters.  To read about the realm of King Arthur from a woman's point of view was unique and beautifu 
  At Whispering Glades funeral home, Loved Ones is the term used to refer to the deceased. My Joyboy, a foolish, weak-willed embalmer, prepares the bodies for viewing by the Waiting Ones, the relatives and friends of the Loved Ones. Miss Aime Thanatogenos, the appropriately named make-up artist at Whispering Glades, is young, innocent and foolish. Mr Joyboy carefully composes the faces of the Loved Ones so that they smile for her when it is time to put their make-up on. Aime blushes and generally acts as though her head is made of air.  Dennis Barlow is a struggling poet and works as a pets' mortician. He has recently suffered the death of his uncle and house-mate, Sir Francis Hinsley, who committed suicide following his dismissal at a Hollywood studio. Barlow visits Whispering Glades, where Aime leads him through the funeral process. He is impressed, both with the young Aime, but also with the care and expense shown to the Loved Ones at Whispering Glades. It is a far height above the casual dumping into furnaces that makes up the majority of his own mortician's work.  Waugh writes with a cynical hand. At times, the text strays into near-parody, it is so caustic and contemptuous of the characters and situations presented. But there is enough wit and sharp insight to make the novel enjoyable. The dialogue in particular crackles, with sly British humour inserted alongside blatant parody of American language. Barlow is given the greatest lines - as a hopeful poet, he comes across as knowledgeable in the face of the grand American ignorance of poetry and culture, embodied subtlety within Aime, and more openly in the blubbering of Mr Joyboy. There is a sense that we are in on the joke with Barlow, which may prove uncomfortable for American readers, as the Americans in the novel are without fail stupid, greedy, shallow and uncultured.  The funeral industry is something that we shall all, in one way or another, come into contact with. One can only hope that it will be at a late stage in our life, but at places like Whispering Glades, children are cared for with as much loving attention as the elderly. Waugh's sharpest insight is showing the ways in which the bereaved are persuaded into outlaying huge amounts for their deceased relatives. Yes, an appropriate and tasteful funeral certainly provides closure and allows for a certain aesthetic and emotional sensibility at a difficult time, but there is no question that some of the grander options for funerals run to the excessive. Waugh captures this almost parasitic end of the industry successfully, with Whispering Glades providing services that range from ordinary all the way up to sarcophagi and private mausoleums.  Waugh's jokes tend to the subtle when it comes to dialogue, and the savage when it comes to plot. Clever lines are so smoothly inserted that an inattentive reader may miss them: 'We usually recommend the casked half-exposure for gentlemen because the legs never look so well.' But the larger parodies of plot are easier to spot. Throughout the novel, Aime is torn between her love for Barlow and her desire for career advancement through Mr Joyboy, which prompts her to write a series of purple letters to the Guru Brahmin, a conglomerate of 'two gloomy men and a bright young secretary', who share the workload of the Guru's newspaper column. Aime, of course, believes that the Guru is a wise man from India, one who is more than capable of helping her choose the right man. We know the joke's on her, but we are also able to raise the satire to a higher level, in realising that, while she helps relieve grieving relatives of their money, outside of work she is capable of being all but swindled by an imaginary Guru.  An easy criticism of the novel is that none of the characters are particularly likable. Aime is naive and hopelessly shallow, while Mr Joyboy is ridiculous and far too much of a mother's boy. Barlow is the most sympathetic of the characters, but only because we are amused by his caustic wit. Take that away, and he is as unappealing as the others. But the novel exists as a satire, not a character study, and it is there where it succeeds. The funeral industry is as ripe as any other for savaging, and Waugh more than rises to the challenge.  The ending to the novel is an incredibly neat fit. Too neat to be anything but contrived, though again, this works because of the novel's intention. The ending is foreshadowed on almost every page, and if that isn't enough, Aime's name gives the game away. While it does wrap up a little too neatly for Barlow, the novel ends in the way that a novel satirical of the funeral industry must. The Loved Ones is short, funny and very sharp. 
 This book was an absolute inspiration to my mom. She picked up this book after some life struggles and she is so encouraged by the self discoveries Barbara Sher helps her find through this book.  The author's kind and thoughtful approach helped her through a very difficult time and inspired her to be a strong, independent woman in today's tough world.

 This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the life and music of J.S. Bach.  Not only are there translations of every known piece of writing by him, and every important document about him, but many of his contemporaries and those in the following generation are quoted on their views of Bach's stature and achievement.  There is also the complete text of the first biography of Bach, written in 1802 by J.N. Forkel and drawing on information from Bach's sons Friedemann and Emanuel.  This book has so much valuable and fascinating information in such a small compass that music lovers will be drawn to it again and agai 
 This book is an excellent overall introduction to Taoism. It covers the history, systems, and practices of Taoism in a very readable style and provides helpful suggestions for further reading. It is a great book for those new to the subject who want a knowledgable and well-written guide to the 'spiritual landscape' of Taoist thought and practices over the centuries. The sections on magical Taoism and meditation are particularly fascinating, as is the opening chapter that discusses its shamanic origins

  In this edited examination of central labor councils in the United States Ness and Eimer provide a comprehensive examination of the challenges and opportunities that the U.S. labor movement has in activating the dormant labor councils.  The writers demonstrate that U.S. labor councils have a long history that veer from their counterparts elsewhere, they represent powerful building blocks toward a stronger workers movement.    Now that the U.S. national unions are examining structure once again, they must take note of the work of this book, which is as relevant today as ever.  Unions simply will not expand through using their leverage unless they view see labor in its new iteration--one that is dispersed throughout metropolitan regions.  Perhaps the most daring AFL-CIO effort is the restructuring of its own house.  The editors and writers of this book provide a field guide on how to transform unions and build worker power.  This book provides concrete studies of Los Angeles, Milwaukee, King Conty (Seattle) and San Jose and Silicon Valley.   Among the contributors are the leading analysts of American labor today:  Stephanie Luce, Immanuel Ness, Joel Rogers, and Stewart Acuff.  
 Of all the directing masters Akira Kurosawa is arguably the greatest. No matter how much praise and hyperbole is shoveled onto his films they always surprise me by how good they are. Not good in a, "this was phenomenal for the 1950's," but good as in, "this is better than just about anything we're seeing today." While watching this movie I was trying to think of an American director who even comes close, but no one quite matches Kurosawa. If Akira Kurosawa and Stanley Kubrick had a street fight in Heaven I gurantee you Kurosawa would kick Kubrick in the nuts and decapitate him inside of a minute.  This film is often described as the impetus for Star Wars. After seeing the prequel trilogy I half expected The Hidden Fortress to be an exact blueprint for Episode IV, but they're really not that similar. It turns out that George Lucas was talented back in the day. If you're looking for simularities you'll find them, but if Lucas himself hadn't mentioned how much this film influenced him I doubt anyone would be drawing parallels. For example, the two peasant characters, Tahei and Matakishi, are supposed to be the inpirations for R2-D2 and C-3PO, but they're not similar in the least. Tahei and Matakishi are slow, bumbling, greedy, and selfish. They're a far cry from Lucas' creations. R2-D2 is the butch in the relationship while C-3PO is his more feminine partner. (I have to give Lucas credit for having the guts to put a gay robot couple in a film way back in the 70's, and it's even more amazing because no one has had the guts to do it a second time. Perhaps one day gay robots will get the screen time they deserve.)  The story involves a princess and her general who are trapped behind enemy lines and must make it back to their own land. Of all the Kurosawa films I've seen this is the most commercial, and should satisfy fans of old action and adventure. Of particular interest is Toshiro Mifune who is a Kurosawa regular. He plays General Rokurota - an all around badass. When his party gets stopped by soldiers trying to hunt them down he quickly kills a couple of them, and then grabs a horse to go hunt down the two trying to escape, all the while letting out a warrior's cry. This action sequence ends in a duel between Rokurota and an opposing general he has a competitive but friendly relationship with. The duel is one of the greatest fight scenes in cinema, and not just because of the fine choreography (although that too), but because of how interesting these two characters are. They respect each other, but if they met on a battlefield then duty would prevail.  This is much more of an action adventure film than something like Roshomon, but Kurosawa still manages to throw in a lot of themes. The princess has a slight epiphony while walking among the peasants, and decides to save a girl before she becomes a sex slave; Tahei and Matakishi are both morally bankrupt but they still seem to serve a purpose in society; and General Rokurota and his rival both seem to say something about the merits and limits of honor. These themes are great and add some depth, but are subservient to sheer adventure of the film, which is how it should be.  This is a great swashbuckling film that is hands down better than any action film made in the last twenty years.  Some have come close, but I think most will agree that nothing beats The Hidden Fortress.  It is absolutely incredible that with all of the technical achievements over the years Kurosawa's action-adventure piece still holds up so well over the years.  Incredible 
 This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the "Spider-Man" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then.  Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie.  Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancee; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child.  While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced debutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy.  In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us.  The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's "Furniture Room Lullaby" which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer 
 Kimberly Elam presents a simple yet comprehensive overview of the role of geometry in the beauty of design and nature. Elam first explores the prevalence of the Golden Section in nature, art, and architecture, and supports the storied beauty of its proportions with an overview of the cognitive proportion preference studies of both Gustav Fechner and Lalo. Red-highlighted illustrations illuminate Elam's clear explanations of how to construct Golden Section (or Fibonacci Series) rectangles, ellipses, and triangles.  Geometry of Design doesn't only cover the Golden Section. Elam also explores the root 2, root 3, root 4, and root 5 rectangles and explains their role in the more familiar European DIN system (root 2), and the construction of hexagons (root 3).  After introducing these common geometric proportions, Elam reveals the geometric structure of historically significant works such as Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Chair, A.M. Cassandre's Wagon-Bar Poster, and Jan Tschichold's Konstruktivisten Poster, as well as contemporary industrial designs such as the Braun Aromaster Coffee Maker and the modern Volkswagon Beetle. Her analyses are concisely written and aptly accompanied by translucent overlays which reveal geometric structures that range from the astonishingly deliberate to the seemingly unintentional.  Kimberly Elam's Geometry of Design is a flawless introduction to the role of design's least visible, yet most powerful, methods of achieving aesthetic beauty. It is a must-read for anyone curious about geometry's role in design 
 This film is often considered one of the first to come out of the Italian Neo-Realism movement, and to a degree it's debatable but in the larger sense I can see where that epithet comes from. This movie is largely a humanistic heroic statement, but its focus is on the utter importance of life... life that is free and unabused.  The setting is Nazi-occupied Rome, the characters, a bunch of Roman citizens who live day by day under the shadow of the Reich. Key to the action is a priest who practices civil disobedience; his friend, a revolutionary; and a pregnant woman who plans to marry the revolutionary. They all try to figure out what's important to them while the Gustapos search for any signs of rebellion, thus putting pressure on their day to day life.  The real mix that helps make this film really empathetic is its focus on heroic inner strength, which can seem to make matters of real life seem lesser, for the purpose of maintaining free and unconflicted life, which it illustrates as most important. Thus the mere act of living is the goal, and the martyr of a hero so others can live the romance. It's quite beautiful really.  It also adds bits of light humor amidst moments of tragedy in a rather grateful way, thus keeping it from being just cynical and depressing. Overall, it really does take the time to care for the simple natures of noteworthy characters.  --PolarisDi 
 'The Chinese Lake Murders' contains the usual threefold, high-quality, ingenious Judge Dee-plot. Unfortunately reading this book isn't that relaxed & comfortable as it should be.   I feel Robert Van Gulik puts in too much facts and too little narrative. The plot being somewhat pressed into its chapters, it allows the reader insufficient opportunity to digest its developments. I think this story could have been told better by using more words in a lower pace.  That really is a pity, for 'the Chinese Lake Murders' has the potential to rank among the best in the Judge Dee-series. Being one of his early novels, Robert Van Gulik clearly hadn't yet fully developped his writing-skills.   
 The sound from this card is definitely better than what my IBM T41 laptop can put out.   The T41 has pretty decent sound, but it cannot process sound in the sophisticated way this card can do.   So it's really a significant step up.  The only issue is a headphone cannot produce the sound effects of 4, 5, 6 or 7 speakers, which this card can do! And it's unlike that I will ever hook up my laptop to a full sound system.  So it's a great product but somewhat unwieldy to harness its full capability in normal daily use with my laptop being moved around so often 
 Bring up the topic of LBJ among those who directly experienced his Presidency and you'll find responses which mirror so much of what you'll hear about our current President: people either loved him or hated him. The politically charged events which marked his administration elicited the strong responses from even the most apathetic American citizen.   Robert Caro's biography on LBJ has been critically acclaimed as one of the most detailed and introspective accounts not only of Lyndon Johnson, but of the political period within which this man operated.  This first volume introduces us to the future President by providing us with a theme that runs throughout the series: the dualism of LBJ - his profound vision and desire to raise up the common man vs. his profound lust for power and control and the lengths he would go to attain that power. Throughout the story we are also provided with glimpses into others who came to weave their lives with LBJ: Sam Rayburn, FDR, John Connally, and Lady Bird Johnson  For a majority of this book, Robert Caro had intimate access to many of LBJ's closest confidants, including Lady Bird for a brief time. This research and work is telling from the beginning. From his humble beginnings as the son of state legislator fighting the corporate interests which controlled the state legislature to his eventual election to Congress and finally his first loss in a strongly contested bid for Senator; this duality is expressed again and again and again.  It is this focus which is the book's greatest strength and it's most telling weakness. The events of LBJ's life, LBJ's personal response to those challenges, and the repercussions/success as a result of that resonse are told in a stark black and white which can sometimes border on vilification. Other times, such as his striving to obtain federal funding for the construction of Mansfield Dam, exemplify his desire to raise up the common man while still building up personal influenc with the powerful Brown and Root company. This starkness is not only exemplified in his political exploits, but through his personal family life.  In the final analysis there can be no doubt, this truly is a strong biography which should and does rank with the best works to come out on LBJ. I highly recommend not only this book, but encourage you to continue on into volume 2 and 3. 
 I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning Swedish.  The authors do a wonderful job in explaining different aspects of swedish verbs and their declensions.  Also, the part on strong verbs is excellent.  Instead of telling you to memorize a bunch of rules, they help you see the pattern.  They also do well explaining archaic verb forms, which is good for anyone who wants to read older historical texts and maybe even family relics from a century ago. This is a great book and you won't regret getting it 
 My husband and I purchased this variety climber and swing set extension for our 16 month old daughter.  She loves it!!  it is easy for her to climb on the side with the little swing and sh loves crawling through the tunnel.  She can even do the rope climb side with a little assistance.  The steering wheel is a great feature as well.  But of course the favorite part is the swings.  We purchased the toddler swing to replace one of the bigger kid swings.  Grace loves to go outside and just crawl and swing and jump.  It has been great for her.  It really has given her an outlet to crawl on something as opposed to kitchen chairs and tables.  I really debated between this one and the other little tikes tropical climber that has no swings and more to crawl around in and I am glad we chose this one.  It was not difficult to put together although you need serious weight to pap the slides into place.  It took me and my husband to get them in.  Th play set is sturday and colorful.    Side note:  The play set that is in the picture that amazon provides is not the set you will get. That is the old set, if you look at the customer provided pics under the amazon picture you can see what it actually looks like, much more updated.  I purchased mine at toys r us because by the time you add shipping the cost is more than buying it in store.  Can't say enough good things about this set!! 
 This is the best book about miniature horses I have read to date.  She goes in depth on several important things, two of which are color and breeding.  I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of buying one.  Or if you already have miniatures and you're looking for a really good book on the breed look no more!  This one's it 
 Enjoyed reading, I gave 2 copies as gifts and both were well recieved and they enjoyed the recipies but the stories were just as entertaining.  
 The pre-existential scalular network of streets--an interconnected web of  pointlessness and meta-consciousness--serves as the background to this  genre-hybridizing book by Jean Rhys.  One of several of her books focusing  on the feminine psyche as it trys to navigate the complicated socioeconomic  hierarchical male-dominated society of pre-postmodern Paris.  Rhys' main  character alternately smiles and crys reflecting the pressures of  pre-millenial Parisian society which judges her solely from the view of  their ocular organs--a tragedy that continues on into our own post-post-war  self-constructed society.  Nihilistic twists combined with masterly  commentary on the futilism of being  erupt into a majestic spewing of anger  and pre-post Derridadian philsophy .  Unfortunately Rhys is unable to  escape the male imposed strictures of the English language resulting in a  book which is inherently contradictory--as most, inevitably, are 
 The book was out of stock and communication was good giving a new date for delivery.  The book came faster than expected for the new date.  Book was new and arrived fine

 I feel a bit silly cause I LOVE this guys plays,so i'm only gonna say Great Things about this play but if you have seen This So Called Disaster you will know a lot more about this play and the first production to be mounted for it-[directed by Shepard]...If you like his plays then this will knock your Bobby Socks Off...What can I say But READ the Damn Thing And make up your own Mind. Once again,Mr shepard has done an awesome job writing what could be the last play about his dad,but like I say, Read It and make up your own mind 
 I started a new business so I bouth two HP 3050's.  They print fast, good quality, no paper jams, bypass for envolopes/checks works fine.  I have used the fax function without any problems.  I have not used the scanner function.  Print refills are readily available and cost effective. No regrets 
 This book made me aware of the interesting background of the Indian culture. I feel it was very well written with a lot of detail and information. However, at times there was too much detail and it slowed down the story. The author knows how to weave the facts with an interesting story. I would loan it to a friend 
 This DVD must have been set out by Warner Bros as a trial run to test the waters for a complete-series release. The episodes on this DVD are some of the series' best, and the picture quality is top-notch. But there's another 121 episodes lying around in the Warner's vaults, most of which are nearly equally good. Where are they?   It's hard to believe but, for those of us who grew up in the 1950s, television westerns (good and bad) were a monotonous staple that could not be avoided -- the number of shows that plied the airwaves in those days simply defies belief. Sure, they all used the same formula -- drifting, melancholy cowboys who occasionally got into trouble but were essentially free, unencumbered and happy. But Maverick was the best of the lot. More often likely to run away from a gunfight than risk injury, the Maverick brothers combined humor and drama in a truly innovative way for the times, and this DVD represents a great sampling of the show.  So where are the rest? 
 I took this book to Hawaii with me and found out very quickly it was a perfect choice.  I loved the relationship between the two main characters.  I felt like the ending may have been a little rushed, maybe because I did not want it to end! Also, I felt a bit of a personality change in the leading male character towards the end of the story. Matthew Lassiter seemed to became a bit passive towards the end of the book.  Other than that I loved the book and still felt it was worth five stars 
 If you havn't heard this album you are really missing out. I'm not going to waste our time going through it track by track because this is simply an astounding musical milestone that all rock fans must listen to. It is one of those classic albums that comes around a couple of times a decade that posseses a mystical quality that will last forever. 
 A delightful portrait of a somnolent English village in mid-nineteenth century Midlands, striving to shut out the noisy industrializing forces changing the world as they knew it. Vivid portraits of the largely single women--spinsters or widows--who dominate the social life of the town and their struggles to control who gets invited to tea parties etc and who doesn't, their criticisms of who doesn't observe the proprieties, and their underlying good-heartedness.  In other words, Gaskell observes the manners and the people of this world with great insight and wit, not just looking at struggles to define etiquette but also at the last vestiges of a peaceful rural place and the changes being thrust upon its classes--working, middle, and nobility. 
 +Zia is such a awsome story! It is about a girl named Zia who is Karanas neice,she lives at the mission Santa Barbara with her little brother Mando.One day Mando and Zia find a old whale boat that drifted up onto shore and decide to use it to go and rescue Karana from the Island Of The Blue Dolphins. Im not gonna say any more about what happens because you will have to find out for your self 
 It doesn't matter who you are, what your background is, or what your religion is. You have a worldview. You may not have specifically thought about it, you may not even realize it but you have one and it effects how you view events and then how you react to those events.   I have realized this for many years and have spoken to many people and I find it most interesting that those who have some of the most dogmatic worldviews refuse to believe that they have any worldviews at all.   Although there are many different worldviews I break them down into two main branches.   1 Ontologically Based Worldviews (Ontology precedes epistemology)  2 Epistemologically Based Worldviews. (Epistemology precedes ontology)  I had thought that I had been a original thinker many times wondering if I should write a book espousing my beliefs and illuminating the world into a new area of thought only to find out that it has already been done. Oh well, at least I can say that I am wholeheartedly endorse this book.  I don't want to have any plot spoilers here but it is well worth the ten bucks for the pure synaptic enjoyment and mental debates you will have. Kudos Mr. Sire for a job well done.

 One of the best guides to invertebrate fossils hunting I have read. Drawing from his experience in the Appalacian region (mainly West Virginia  and Virginia), the author offers many fine sites which are accesible to the professional and amature alike. Was well worth the 8 hour drive  from New  Jersey and the cost of the book ! Includes excellent annotated references  as well 
 I came across this book in the 1990's,  I was familiar with Elizabeth Elliot, H.Clay Trumbull's great grand daughter, and had great respect for her.  I always wonder, about what the parents were like, of a person like Elizabeth Elliot.  I was also looking for something fresh on Child Teaching and Training. I wanted a biblical perspecitve but was frustrated for years with the status quo "christian based" parenting books.   Our own family at the time, consisting of 4 sons, one in particular so very strong willed, while the children were doing well and respectful, I wanted more. I wanted to do better as a parent, and to gain new insight. Now that we have 3 younger daughters, I am enjoying reading this book once again. It always seemed that the "christian parenting" books were more about how to "control" than disciple. This book is so refreshing.  It is about discipling little ones.  It is compassionate, caring and not a "how to" book.  I am so thankful for that. Trumbull makes you look at yourself, are you being tender? compassionate? Understanding?  Are you depending upon the Lord for HIS wisdom for your little one?  When your child goes to bed, are the lasts words they hear from you harsh or loving?   I cannot say enough positive things about this book. And I just love, that he dispells the assumptions of modern day parents that in the "olden days" every parent was harsh and beat their children.  It couldn't be further from the truth 
 This book is really cute! The 7 year old boy I purchased it for wants to read it over and over again! The illustrations are really colorful and well done. This is the type of book that is great fun for a boy or girl - ages 4 to 8, I should think. The author, Jan Brett, is very clever. I will look for more of this authors books in the future for children on my gift list. Loriann Ringgold Elko, NV 
 Personally, I think this is a great movie and not to be missed. Especially, if you have already watched Pokemon-The First Movie. I like this movie because it han a very interesting story line continuing from the previous movie. Mewtwo from the first movie is so cruel, mean and has no sympathetic feeling. But, in this movie, his inner feelings is very appealing. The whole story was about Mewtwo's dilemma regarding on his and his cloned pokemon origin and where they should belong. The part where he willing to rescue humans(in the bus) really touched me cause he was totally different from the previous movie. His act of struggling to protect his own cloned pokemon from Team Rocket's boss really touched me. The part where he stopped the cloned Pikachu from battling Ash's Pikachu fascinated me cause he's the one starting all the battles in the first movie. The most interesting part is the ending. Mewtwo's act of releasing all his cloned pokemon for them to seek freedom rather than keeping them with him nearly made me cry. The whole movie is very, very good! Beside that, the soundtracks in the movie are also very nice. So, those who have watched 'The First Movie' must watch this one as well.     
 Bourdieu's structuralist analyses of gender in Kabyle culture and personal reflections on gender in the modern Western world are consistently cogent, thoughtful, and well-presented. A number of other reviewers have called this book "unreadable." It is certainly full of Bourdieu's characteristic jargon, but I would like to note that this jargon is systematically developed throughout all of Bourdieu's work; learning to read it is not unlike learning a language. I therefore would not recommend this text to someone unfamiliar with Bourdieu. First read Distinction, his foundational work on cultural capital, and perhaps Wacquant's introduction to Invitation to a Reflexive Sociology. Take some time. Define and redefine his terminology for yourself. This book, along with his others, will become more readable and, of course, more rewarding.

 I have just viewed a beautiful Eva Hesse retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and this book is a catalogue of that exhibit. Eva Hesse was exceptionally talanted, innovative artist, associated freely with what is described as Minimalism. She considerably expanded horizons of our thinking of modern art, introducing new textures, such as latex and fiberglass, presenting her highly original, personal vision with rare integrity and also intensity. The exhibit provides a fascinating survey of her carreer: from early Expressionist paintings to collages made from found objects to mature sculptures which challange viewers' notions of artifact, museum space and artistic performance. I think the book preserves the best experience from that show and combines it with interesting, sometimes thought-provoking essays on Hesse by observant art critics. It is invaluable as a source on Hesse, Minimalism and, more broadly, international artistic scene of the 60s, of which Eva Hesse was one of the prime, crucial figures 
     In Sophocles' Antigone, there is an ever-present sense of doom and despair awaiting the reader on with every flip of the page.  The desolate plot dealing with the hold of fate over each individual has the reader end the play with a sense of helplessness and abandonment.  There is nothing that an individual can do to escape the fate laid out before them.  Although Antigone is a well written play with underlying themes of holding fast to a set of beliefs and loyalty to family, the overpowering motif of life being controlled by a divine force is quite depressing, giving the reader an allover sense of hopelessness. 	The focus point of Antigone was the stronghold the gods held over each individual's life.  Despite Creon's numerous attempts to correct his unintentional disgraces, in the end, his efforts were futile.  Creon was walking the fine line of trying to maintain the welfare and happiness of the citizens of Thebes, as well as to do what he thought was morally upright within himself.  Because of his inability to obtain this inner balance, Creon only succeeded in bringing doom upon himself.  The entirety of the play centers around an action which Creon believed to be righteous, which was the decision not to bury Polynices.  It is not likely that at the moment Creon made the proclamation to not lay soil upon Polynices, that any thoughts of the utter devastation the coming days would unfold were even a fleeting thought.  What seemed to be a blessing handed out by the gods was actually a death sentence for Creon's soul.  	The Chorus speaks of the ultimate power of the gods by saying, "Thy power, O God, what pride of man constraineth, which neither sleep that all things else enchaineth, not even the tireless moons of Heaven destroy?  Thy throne is founded fast, high on Olympus, in great brilliancy, far beyond Time's annoy.  Through present and through future and through past abideth one decree; Nought in excess enters the life of man without unhappiness."  The above statement is a prime example of how the gods so willingly lavished fine accolades upon a mortal one minute, while in the next they were stripping him of all his worldly possessions.  The gods continually acted on whims, and mortals were nothing by a plaything to which they acted as a puppeteer.  Sophocles was specifically mentioning the hiatus between the place of the gods and the place of a mortal.  The gods were above reproach, seated high on the Olympian throne, while the mortals could do nothing more than to just worship them in awe.  Not even time was able to be a force acting on the gods, but they could do as they pleased, and they did do as they wished with the mortal as their instruments of play. 	While the majority of the play dealt with the role of gods over the human race, there was one admirable quality found within the title character which should be emulated by all who read the play.  Antigone was so determined and steadfast on bringing her brother a burial, she was willing to face death as a consequence.  If society today had more zealots of their beliefs as Antigone epitomized, the world would become revolutionized, with strong leaders rising out of the multitudes instead of the rather unassertive and politically correct leaders the world is breeding.  If the strong nations had leaders who were not willing to alter the way they believe or pander to the demands of a minority, but stood strong, despite criticism and upset, the outcome would be a society truly living what it professes instead of just meandering through life attempting to keep the majority settled. 	The tragedy of Antigone is a superb play which any individual can relate to.  Whether it be having taken part in a situation that seemed to be spiraling out of control, or being able to empathize with Antigone and her passion to do what was upright, even the modern audience can relate to the trials present in Antigone.  The plot of this play is intriguing, and ultimately, any individual yearning for a greater knowledge of fate, human nature, or even just Greek literature would be able to draw conclusions which, if integrated into their life, would be beneficial to anyone.    
 This book speaks true to so many teenage issues. The suggestions are brilliant and work.I tried the "take the door off of the room" and it worked like a charm. I also admired the example of how a family sold their teens car when they broke the no drug rule. This book is written by a parent who has been there and done that! I highly recommend this book to anyone dealing with a pre-teen.  This way you will be ready for them.  I also recommend Indigo Teen Dreams. Both of these books/cds have been helpful tools raising my teens 
 This is an excellent book; it can stand on its own, if you have any interest in that time of history as well as being an excellent companion for Patrick O'Brian's seafaring legacy.  It puts all the answers at your finger tips.  What is a stone? What or where is the ships knee? And a whole host of other terms from the obscure to common, this book helps answer many of those questions that you might have if you're no well versed in the language, terms, and history of the era.  I highly recommend this book as well as Harbors and High Seas by the same author, together they will make your Journey around the world and back again with Jack Aubrey, and Stephen Maturin, a very memorable experience, you may even want to start all over again when you finish.  Pleasant voyages, and glorious sunsets

 Really enjoy the ability to see all four levels of skill that are presented.  The one annoying thing is that almost all the poses are with the legs spread wide - I guess they figure our bodies are too large for a front to back lunge?  :  
 This twelve track disc is a tad better than their 'Orbvs Terrarvm' CD(see my review).For this record,the band has been stripped down to just two members,former Killing Joke roadie Alex Peterson and Andy Hughes.My prefered cuts are the first two,"Delta MK2" and "Ubiquity" in which I notice in the credits for these two listed is Steve Hillage(Gong,Khan,Arzachel).Hillage must've have co-written the two songs with Peterson and Hughes.I also sort of liked "Passing Of Time" and the extremely far-out sounding "72".A good title,if you enjoy electronic musi 
 With her usual wit and style, MFK Fisher brings the food and atmosphere of Dijon alive.  It is a fun book, perfect as an introduction to a way of life that is both foreign and dated.  The delights of the table set by an eccentric landlady and shared with a variety of characters from the building, are extravegant.  Fisher also draws a picture of the town's restaurants, markets, and life.  A good read 
 If you are looking for an advanced book to help you put together an Evaluation Plan for a training program, you want this book. If you know little about Evaluation Plans, then try Evaluation Basics (from ASTD) first, then get this book. Rapid Evaluation will bring you through low complexity to high complexity plans depending on what you need to do. The authors give sound advice about setting up the plan whether you're doing employee training or leadership training. I am currently using this book for a work project and am finding it invaluable. $$ well spent. 
 Earlier, I wrote that the live disc was a minor disappointment.  I still believe that.  But, the more I listen to the live disc, the more I like it.  As you listen to it repeatedly, your mind tends to ignore the sound quality problems and tends to blank out during the bad minutes, like the first two tracks.  You then focus on the truly great moments.   With your computer and good sound editing software, you could create a fairly nice CD of 30 to 40 minutes of great jamming music.  You might even be able to correct some of the sound problems 
 This is an outstanding book for any one needing to identify shrubs, plants,trees,and flowers. Also gives concise instructions on planting. Lovely color photos on each page. Lots of helpful tips. Many thanks to Mr.  Halfacre 
 Peter doesn't hold back. He gives honest stories about the stars that populated his Squares from 1966-82, and they're all fascinating reading. Any fan of game shows or celebrities in general will greatly enjoy this book. The CD of "zingers" is icing on the cake; dozens and dozens of the best joke answers from Lynde, Weaver, Hackett, Rose Marie, etc. Classic comedy 
 Every couple of years I get so fed up with things I want to walk, even though I really enjoy management. Whenever my corporate world starts to resemble "Arrested Development," I read this book again. After almost ten yearts the book is falling apart after a lot of use. I have this book on tape and I keep it in the car.  Among all my books on management, and I've a whole shelf full of them, this remains my touchstone.  Note, though, the book is NOT by Michael Crichton; Crichton wrote the forward. 
 The 20th anniversary edition of this work comes at the opening of  "the Year of the Eucharist," as proclaimed by Pope John Paul II. Schreck describes his work as an effort "to contribute to a better understanding of the teaching and tradition of the Catholic Church so that Catholics and other Christians may grow together in unity in our Christian life and in our common proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ." We must band together, he writes, to defend the faith against "the relativism and unbelief that are rampant in the post-Christian West. Thus begins a wonderful reference book for Catholics and others regarding Church teaching on salvation, the origin of Catholic beliefs, the Church and her authority, the work of the Holy Spirit, the sacraments, the Communion of Saints, Mary, and Man's Destiny in Christ. The work is well organized, with helpful sub heads, extensive footnotes, and a detailed index. This is an excellent resource for individuals, small church communities, catechists, and pastoral staff. 
 I bought this book on sale at K-Mart, and it was definitely worth the few dimes I spent for it.  This book reads like a novel, fast and furious, not much down time.  If you don't know about John O'Neill, a true hero, or martyr in this case, then you need to read this book. Yes, O'Neill has his faults (don't we all!!), #1 -  he is definitely a ladies man and has three ladies plus an undivorced marriage on the string, and #2 - he becomes forgetful and loses things that almost cost him his job.  But hey, that's only two negatives compared to the positives this guy was made of.  His story is a compelling statement made against our current President and his predecessors that did not follow up on his predictions that Al Qaeda would strike again and again.  To top it off, he even predicted his own death in the Twin Towers the day before.  If you don't read this book, then you don't care how terrorists have us under their grip and won't let go. 
 This is not Harvey's best book, but it does a great job of applying the princlples that he teaches in other books.   He used his rolodex to gather some stories of big names, and used their crediblity to help market the book. We can learn a lot from him on this one 
 Great Use case book! Whether you read them or write them I consider this book critical. It has many examples and great explanations on when to use what format 
 If you didn't already know by there first album, The Agony Scene's sophomore release, "The Darkest Red," makes it pretty apparent that this is not just another metalcore band. The guitarists are clearly (at least partially) influenced by thrash, because they play non-stop fiery riffs which wouldn't be out of place on a modern Slayer or Lamb of God album. The guitars and drums interlock to make a typically very catchy rhythm section which occasionally grooves (as in track four), and always shreds the listener's speakers. The music on here doesn't offer anything strictly new to metalcore, but Mike's vocals make this Oklahoma quintet stand out from the rest of the pack. His greasy/grimy, snarly, retching vocals sometimes sound kind of like Dave Mustaine (like during the beginning of the title track), but they usually echo Kreator more than anything. There is some relief; "Screams Turn Into Silence" has clean backing vocals, but it's the only song on here to have melody of any kind. Track two, "Darkest Red," has fast double bass work and chugging guitars, "Procession" has a catchy, punching, stop-start rhythm, and "Scars of Your Disease" and "Suffer" are explosive, with pounding, almost thunderous rhythms. But the album's lead single, "Prey," is my personal favorite. It begins with a walloping, machine gun snare drum attack, but then the thrashy, groove-y guitars kick in, and the song just sounds downright awesome. "The Darkest Red" is a very enjoyable listen, it sounds pretty darn great, and this band has cemented itself has more than just another metalcore band. So, if you haven't already checked them out, definitely put The Agony Scene on your to-do list 
 ... you may want to give this one a go.  I'm amazed to realize that it's 37 years old; I think this film is going to end up among the classics when it gets a little older.  I'm not a big Western-watcher at all.  But I end up watching this one when it's televised because the cinematography is marvelous.  It's what I loved when it first came out (I'm revealing my age) - that and William Goldman's screenplay.  For those reasons, even if you don't care for shoot-em-ups, it's worthwhile 
 This album put Christian rock on the map.  The unsubtle references to the Lord, baptism, redemption, and the struggles of dealing with one's devotion to Christ are all there.  With a musical backdrop that has lured people from more primitive tastes to develop a closer, deeper, and in some cases subconscious, relationship with God, this band has done more than an entire generation of televangalists to bring people into the fold 
 This book gives great information from building the foundation to shelving. I found it a great help in choosing my greenhouse kit and what foundation to use. Anyone interested in purchasing or building their own greenhouse needs this book. I read several, this one was the best. 
 I read and reread this book several years ago. It gave great insight into the realms of the spirits and their rather very serious impact on those living. The departed spirits communicated through an intermediary, medium, his wife. The stories told touched my heart and enhanced my understanding of the nature and character of the spirits. That provided wealth of information for my book, Secrets of Life, Beyond...  I would highly recommend this book not only to healthcare providers but the public at large.

 Would it interest readers to know that at the time that William Wilkie Collins was writing THE MOONSTONE in 1858, he was cheating on Mrs. Caroline Graves, his lover?  That same year he left her, and had the first of his three children with Martha Rudd, a woman he never married.  Two years later, he carried on a relationship with both women!  No wonder he drew the unlikable Miss Clack, the Christian evangelist, so severely.  Miss Clack wouldn't have at all approved.  And why did Collins write the character of the opium-addicted physician's assistant, Ezra Jennings, so sympathetically?  Perhaps because Collins was experimenting with opium at the time of its writing, but hadn't yet become the delusional addict he would become later in life.  Sinning always seems fun...for a season.  You and I both know that TS Eliot, who loved THE MOONSTONE, wouldn't approve of my type of critique.  He decried critics who look outside of the text.  But so what?    Tabloid-style criticism will in no way detract from the excellence of this book, even if Collins was the typical intellectual who didn't think he had to play by the rules.  Collins knows how to tell a story, and to keep the reader interested.  And he mastered the first person narration by strictly telling us, in several distinct voices, only what each character sees and knows, which makes for some great red herrings.    Did I also mention that Collins was a best selling author and that THE MOONSTONE was the last of his successes?  Who says bestsellers can't stand the test of time?  
 He uses too many military and sports illustrations. He tends to generalize about culture. He uses some Christian Psychological and sociological studies. I mean, who cares? If you don't know how the surveys are taken and what questions they ask, what can you tell from them?  Anyway, my biggest beef is that he does not talk about about how Christians should function within the Church. Raising a family should be done within the family of families, which is the church. It should not solely be the duty of the lone point man on patrol. I have these same criticisms about "Finishing Strong." However, this book is not as gimicky or poorly written as finishing strong. He gives some interesting advice about "habits of the heart." He makes me look at my own walk with God and how I can do better, which is the purpose of this book. Christians need to be encourage on how to pass on their faith to the next generation. I might even read this book again. I would never do that with "Finishing Strong."   I marginally recommend this book to young fathers. We read this in our small group and everybody else liked it so I am bumping it up to four stars.  
 I AM NOT MUCH OF A FAN OF GOTHIC TYPE MUSIC BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR A CD FOR MY HALLOWEEN PARTY. ALL THE [...] HALLOWEEN CD'S THAT I HAVE ARE SO CHEESY. HOW LONG CAN YOU LISTEN TO DOORS CREAKING AND PEOPLE SCREAMING? I WANTED SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED LIKE MUSIC. BOY DID I GET IT WITH THIS CD. THE MUSIC IS HAUNTING AND BEAUTIFUL,EXCITING AND STRANGELY CALMING. IT GIVES YOU THE FEELING YOU GET BEFORE A THUNDERSTORM. THE PIPE ORGAN IN THIS CD IS FABULOUS. I WILL LISTEN TO THIS CD LONG AFTER HALLOWEEN IS OVER 
 Finally, some science to back up what we all really knew anyway...unsustainable fads are not healthy.  I've lost 17 pounds and dropped 30 points off my cholesterol--and feeling like I'm finally eating again after all the years of privation and subsequent weight gain.  I have had no problems putting the ideas from this book to use in our trips to the Chinese, Mexican and American restaurants--as some readers have mentioned.  And I also have had no angst about the amounts of olive oil mentioned in some of the recipes.  The authors talk about balance--and I have finally found it, thanks to this book 
 This classic 80s movie tells the storey of two black sisters. There journey they take wto reunite with each other while there slipt apart by a cruel black man after he is beaten wil try to have sex with on of the girls. Due to a couple of brief brawl sequences, heavy cursing mild racism and heavy abuse and mistreat of women I do not recommend this movie to any one under the age of 13 unless supervised by at least two parents or guardians of 13 years of age or older. Will the two sister be reunited after be apart for more than 20 years. find out in the thrilling heart warming conclusion 
 After all of the reports from the band, and all the reports from fans who had heard it due to the leak, I knew that this album was gonna be different than their past releases. It's not too far from sounding like rEVOLVEr, so it might help if you're a fan of that album, or if you're pretty open-minded like me, you might enjoy this and the other albums. As the collector's edition goes, I only recommend getting it if you're a big fan. The best parts of the bonus dvd are the "making of" footage and the live performances. The only reason why I bought it over the regular edition was because this was on sale at a local record store.  Is it a contender for "album of the year?" Likely. Is it some of the best music The Haunted has ever put out? Definitely 
 A reminder that we are all so different, yet alike.  This look at the life of Wang-Lung and O-lan takes you from poverty to wealth.  It explores the humility of the peasants and the excesses of the rich.  You are swept away in a world of starvation, simplicity and sheer 'will to live' in a country so vast it is almost beyond our comprehension.  O-lan is the strongest woman you will likely ever meet and Wang-Lung the most devoted 'tiller of the land' since creation.  Their story sweeps us through three generations with twists and turns skillfully written and heavy with surprises.  Can this Wang-Lung who is consumed with lust for Lotus Blossom really be the same farmer we meet in the fields of his fathers land?  Can this O-lan, smart enough to spot that loose brick, be the same slave who was beaten daily at the Great House?  The answer to both is yes.  Pearl Buck does not provide a snapshot of these characters.  She tells us their life story and it unfolds beautifully and richly.  Anyone who reads this book will walk away with a feeling that they have met two people who once lived in China and were miraculously reborn. 
 This is the only book I have read written by Bradford.I enjoyed the book and recommend it to everyone.I plan to read more of BBB's books after reading this one 
 Enjoy a well written text book of Christian missions, from the eariliest beginnings to modern history.  From the Apostle Paul, to Jim Elliott, each story will help you understand what the mission field is all about. It is so exciting to read about Patrick becoming a missionary to Ireland or Hudson Taylor going to China.  It is exciting to read about David Livingston exploring Africa and William Carey in India.  The book has exciting sections about Medical Missions, Single Women Missionaries, Twentified Century Martyrs and my favorite Missionary Aviation. Reading this masterpiece, you will learn by about these great men and women of God, how you too, can be an effective missionary.  Learn about their trials they had to experience. From the South Seas, the Americas and to the remotest places on earth these missionaries traveled.  Some lived long lives and others died for the cause of Christ.  Some were even eating by cannibals.  You can learn alot from their lives. This is must reading for every Christian in the world!! 
 The movie was incredable as far dbz movies go. Every character is portraid well. Even Vegeta who alot of people complain about, But the truth is he only fights battles he is sure he can win with the expetion of the battle with Cell and that because his son died. But Broly is awsome he just kicks everyones butt, but he is quite insane. Goku,Trunks,and Gohan do their share of fighting and falling. Its just a fun movie to watch espically if your in the mood to watch the heroes get slamed around. 
 Matussem's story gently dominates the myriad stories about his family's immigrant experiences in the United States.  (Variations on his family's story  are played out by immigrants around the world.)  Abu-Jaber writes on  this universal theme with an authentic voice that reveals longing for  origins - a place that feels like home 
 Sorry, after reading some negative reviews I just had to speak up.  This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I still to this day watch it over and over again.  Well directed, some of the best acting I have seen, and my god the cast in this movie, the list of stars is endless.  The courtroom scenes were so intense, I envey anyone who has not seen this yet.  The story was perfect and so many surprises and turns.  Really well done.  This movie is worth every penny, I just wish I would of got to see it in the movies.  It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen, how can anyone say this movie was not good, I guess they just can't handle the truth.. 
 This stand works great for bringing the monitor up to eye level. If you want to sit comfortably...get rid of back and neck strain...this Targus Stand is definately the way to go. And...the price is right 
 This is one of the most beautiful poetry anthologies I have ever read.  After I finished reading through it the first time, I read it twice more during the same weekend.  The poetry is at turns passionate and serene, and the art works are an added bonus to a beautiful and worthwhile book which leaves you feeling as though the world will, no matter the latest fear or disaster, continue on a path as carefully laid as the stars are placed in the heavens.  I highly recommend this anthology 
 Owning a rather extensive Civil War library, I tend to approach Civil War books with a certain skepticism; it's very difficult at this point for a book to avoid repeating historical information, and even emotional effects, that are already covered extensively in my collection.  But this latest by Charles Flood is a gem.  The author has an exceptionally rare narrative gift.  If you haven't read of these events before, you'll be in excellent hands discovering them here.  And even if you have several times over, you'll find them delivered in a fresh and powerful way.  This book starts out as something like a dual biography, of Ulysses Grant and William Sherman.  After fate brings these two men together, the narrative shifts to being about their relationship, about how each detected and reinforced the best qualities in the other, and how indispensable these two men together were to preventing the dissolution of the Union.  Flood presents many scenes that enable the reader to take the measure of Grant.  Towards the beginning of the book he tells an oft-recounted story of Grant's laconic determination to persevere after a disastrous day at the battle of Shiloh, and what an impression this made on Sherman.  (I'd re-tell it here, but it's much better in Flood's hands.)  Flood also gives wonderful glimpses of the touching lifelong romance between Grant and his beloved Julia.  The story of her failure to get a surgical correction for her mis-aligned eyes, and of Grant's declaration of his love for her precisely as she was, will move all but the most callous readers.  At the same time, Flood doesn't shy away from the ugly sides of Grant or Sherman. Marvelously admirable though they are in most respects, they voice expressions of both racist and anti-semitic attitudes that must make the modern reader cringe.  Flood does a splendid job late in the book of detailing some delicate maneuvers in which Grant engaged, in order to rescue Sherman from some political difficulties others had created for him, and which Sherman's own irascible temperament had exacerbated.  The story of the death of Sherman's son, of the love the boy had inspired among the Federal troops, and the touching letter that Sherman wrote to those troops, who had made the late son an honorary officer, is also told with grace and eloquence.  So, too, are a few passages about Robert E. Lee.  The moving surrender scene between Lee and Grant is encapsulated here, but there are also more obscure, but equally affecting, ones.  One involves Lee's compassionate response, during the retreat from Gettysburg, to the taunts of a wounded Federal soldier.  The book works, in the end, because it's a can't miss story. You have two men, an odd couple, facing up to the most momentous challenge imaginable.  You also have the appeal of their surprising and sudden ascents from seemingly failed lives -- inspiring enough with one such man, but present here with two.  And you have the unfolding of a relationship of touching loyalty, in a world otherwise filled with intrigue.  In a certain way, even these two fierce warriors were too good for their times, and the nation benefited.  But good as the material is, it's the treatment by the author that makes it a surpassing book.  I flew through it without intending to.  It's simply an irresistible read.    Highest recommendation. 
 I knew my daughter found her dress when I heard the squeals of delight. Living in a small town our choices are limited, so I turned to Amazon.com for my daughters graduation dress. The picture shows a very pretty dress, but when I got it this turned out to be a truly stunning dress. The fit was perfect, PacificPlex's sizes are right on, and their sizing chart really helped so check that out before you buy. The dress in very well made and included straps that could be sewn on should one choose too. My daughter felt like a princess and my friend ordered the burgundy version for her daughters graduation. This dress is beautiful in both colors. We are very pleased. 
 Loved this book just like all the In Death books.  I can't wait for the next one.  You learn a lot about Eve's childhood and things that happened to her as a child.  J. D. Robb is a great writer and I hope this series never ends 
 Despite this book being written by the lawyer who represented the parents of Nancy Cruzan who wanted feeding apparatus to be withdrawn and thus to have Nancy die, this book presents the issues and the struggle fairly and even-handedly.  This is shown in a way since after reading it I conclude the U.S Supreme Court's decision was right--in the circumstances shown the family could without monetary loss have permitted their child to not be starved to death.  The account of the trial and of the appellate history of the case is absorbing and shows the author is an able lawyer, admirable in representing his clients.  I have no hesitancy in saying if it had been my child I would not have gone to the efforts which Nancy's father went to in order to have his child die.  But psychologically Nancy's parents wanted the living death to end and their lawyer was right to seek the relief his clients desired.  An extraordinary book 
 The Great Santini is Colonel Bull Meecham, husband to his lovely Southern enabling wife Lillian, father to Ben, Mary Anne, Matt, and Karen, Marine, fighter pilot, bully, creep, alcoholic, and all around jerk. Bull rules his family as he does the marines that serve under him. A bad drunk, Bull experiences violent mood swings, which send his family into chilling bouts of fear, hatred, and battles with the brute. Ben, most of all, the oldest, is most challenged by Bull, most humiliated, and most deeply touched, although his sister Mary Anne is a very close second. Ben is a very transparent stand-in for Conroy, although how much of this work is autobiographical is hard to know, but I suspect most of it is. Conroy could not write with such depth of feeling if he didn't experience this material firsthand. All I can say is that experiencing Bull Meecham is like experiencing brutality and hell in order to discover kindness, heaven, and love.  Clearly written, brilliant, scintillating, this work sharply etches an unhappy family and the inner life of a boy and his love/hate relationship with his father. It also presents life in the racist south of the early 1960s, its beauties, and its nightmares. I was deeply moved by this work in spite of the ugliness of Bull Meecham and the marines he loved. This is a genuine work, an American novel, and a major achievement. 
 It is interesting that a lawyer can write so well about food as to make one salivate! Entertaining, funny (perhaps witty) and informative, sprinkled with social commentary and hugely entertaining. Buy both books if you love food and its history, preparation and glories 
 As a writer, and as someone whose own experiences of childhood loss and its aftereffects closely parallel those of Dr. Cournos, I found City of One both deeply moving and comforting.  We who have the hole where the loving  parent should be, we who deal with the myth and the anger and the quest for  wholeness, understand every word.  Not only does Dr. Cournos evoke the pain  of the loss, but her honesty and her search for the strengths that can come  from a tragic early life goes beyond judgment and pathology.  It goes to  the things that define our lifelong sense of who we are.  I highly  recommend this memoir to anyone who wants to understand or who struggles  with these issues 
 This is an exciting and explorative story that merges informed quantum physics with imaginative story teller 
 I'm to page 61 and am already impressed.  After having seen Todd present at several events (which is an event in itself), I knew it would be thorough information and simply put.   As a full-time Notes developer, I have had limited experience with WSS.  I had a few months to experiment with V2 a couple of years ago and not much else since then but reading to keep up with the latest.  The book has been easy to follow for me.  This book makes complicated features/concepts simpler.  Some highlights so far:  -Short code snippets about the object model, which is much easier to digest than a page of code. -the explanations of WSS 3.0 authentication are enlightening and will enable me to understand and discuss it with people who know much more about it. -the explanation of the Mobile Emulator setup was simple and concise. -He doesn't blur the lines between WSS and MOSS!   It has been my experience to date that good information on WSS is scattered and, many times, much more information than I need.  I want to read something that gives me an immediate understanding of the subject at hand, gives me what I NEED TO KNOW, I'll fill in the details later.  This book brings it all together in a clear, concise manner 
 A bunch of one-liners from various comedians.  Some comedians seem to be heavily favored; some of them are good, and some are not.  Definitely some good comedy.  The book was really marked down when I bought it, so I think it was a good buy 
 Solid product.  Headphone/speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted $40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed!  I bought this great little unit instead for under $30.  Good audio.  Actually, it saved my laptop once too, laptop fell from 2-3 feet but landed right on the rubberized Turtle Beach Micro, which took most of the force.  It was bent 90 degrees at the USB connector but it still worked!  Proof of solid construction.. 
 `The Long Black Veil' by the Irish musical group, the Chieftains is a demonstration of the power of a guest appearance by Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones on the album of a well established group of a different genre.  I recall this album being previewed on our local NPR station on a Tuesday and when I went to my local Borders in the same radio market, the CD was completely sold out within a day of the airplay of the title cut on which the Mick does the vocal solo.  And, to make the mix even more interesting, this particular album has quite a large mix of guest stars, far beyond the previous Chieftains hosting a single guest, as they did with their album with Van Morrison. The other guests are Sting, Sninead O'Connor on two tracks, Van Morrison, Mark Knopfler, Ry Cooder on two cuts, Marianee Faithfull, and Tom Jones. Even Frank Zappa makes a ghostly appearance as the host of the recording session with Tom Jones on the `Tennessee Waltz'.  The combination of this awesome collection of talent plus the great instrumental work by the Chieftans themselves makes each and every track on this album an evocation which survives relistening over the years.  One Irish music weakness this album escapes is the feeling that there is really only one `Irish song', done in many different styles with many different combinations of lyrics and instruments. While I never totally subscribed to this theory, there is a sense in which there is a great sameness to the melodies of many Irish songs. This is probably what is meant by the `lilt' of Irish melodies. Oddly, I think it is probably harder to identify the nature of this `lilt' than it is to exactly define what distinguishes a blues song, which must be an iambic pentameter, exactly the same meter as Shakespeare's verses.  My most important message to non-Irish music fans is that you will like this album even if you have no taste for traditional Irish music. You will probably like it even if you don't like the Rolling Stones. Jagger's vocals on the title tune indicates how well he would do with other traditional material. I also have to say that Sinead O'Connor's performances on this album prompted me to get some of her albums, and I find her work alone is simply not quite as good as her two selections on this album.  Very highly recommended. 
 I first saw this in a bookstore, and the title made me curious. I ended up standing in the corner there laughing like an idiot. Then, I bought it for a friend who had a baby last May. It is a great "counterweight" to those cutesie baby books that they probably get from friends and relatives anyway 
 Very interesting, and informative on the times that the event was occuring in the Hawaiian islands.  The story kept focused, and was very easy to read and keep up with 
 I love these books about the Professor. I listen to them in my car over and over. The finer points of sausage doge is also very good about the same professor. I would recommend these books on CD for any long car trip. They will keep you laughing 
 A great book, maybe a little slow at the end.  If you like Taki, I highly reccomend this collection of his writings 
 White nationalists are often portrayed in the media as violent, hateful idiots. This book provides a much needed antidote to such stereotypes. If you think one can't simultaneously be a white nationalist and a thoughtful, caring person, then you MUST read this book. Most of the people profiled -- via their own words, I might add -- come across as being intelligent, caring people who, more than anything, simply want a better life for themselves and their children. Robert S. Griffin has done a great service to white nationalists by publishing this book 
 After watching the movie you'll wonder if it was the simplicity of the movie or the overwhelming charm and beauty of Giovanna Mezzogiorno that captivated your attention. I guess it is a combination of both (however, I am tempted to give more marks to the sparkling beauty of Giovanna Mezzogiorno). Giovanna and her husband run into an octogenarian (played by Massimo Girotti) suffering from partial amnesia on the streets of Rome. Reluctant to leave him alone, they bring him home for the night. He doesn't speak much, but after some coaxing by Giovanna's kids, he reveals his name as Simone. For some inexplicable reason Giovanna's husband does not take Simone to the police and Simone lands up staying with their family for a few days. In the mean time relationship between Giovanna and her husband gets strained and in a trite twist, Giovanna gets attracted towards a smart looking man living across the street (and has facing windows).  Simone's memory relapse continues and he mysteriously wanders into old city, knocking on the doors of an old shop (Simone has a number etched on his forearm, which is a tell-tale insignia of a Nazi prisoner). One day, Simone goes missing and Giovanna embarks on a mini investigation to track him down. She manages to locate him. Simone is actually a very well-off ex-baker (and also a queer) who had rescued many prisoners from the Nazis. Simone teaches Giovanna some trade secrets of baking excellent cakes/pastries and indirectly advices her to avoid succumbing to temptations of an extra-marital fling with the neighbor. Giovanna overcomes her temptations, starts her life anew by starting her own bakery and accepting her husband again.  The story is very simple, but the execution is wonderful. Watch it ... you wont be disappointed 
 "Isa Lei" is my favourite piece on this cd. It is a FIJIAN farewell song, not Hawaiian like most people tend to think. Being a Fijian myself, I couldn't help but cry when I first heard Ry Cooder and Bhatt's rendition 
 This new year's I made a resolution that I would be a more self-confident and assertive individual. A few weeks afterwards, I met a friend who told me about M.A.C.K. Tactics, and how it's just loaded with information on how to be confident and comfortable with meeting new women and being able to talk to them. I instantly became very curious about this book so I bought the book online. The day I received it in the mail and began reading it, I could not put it down until I was completely finished. This is the type of book that I wish I had when I was growing up as a teenager as it would have helped me avoid many useless dates, bad relationships, and the wrong women.  For all the men that are reading this, let me tell you that this book is filled with information on not only how to talk to women and what signs to look for in certain situations, but it also gives yourself a sense of confidence, and allows your mind to have the right attitude. Something that all of us need--not just in scenarios where we meet women, but in all areas of life.  This book is a must recommend, and I highly encourage you to read it from cover to cover 
 I've never seen the original Time Machine versions before, but I absolutely loved this movie. I am of course a big fan of special effects, but the story is fascinating! I've watched the movie several times, and every single time I'm blown away. The story line is inspirational and imaginative and knows no bounds. You'll continue to wonder where the story will end up. If you love science fiction and have a fascination for time travel, then add this movie to your collection! 
 "Middle March" is often regarded as George Eliot's greatest novel but "Silas Marner" is undisputedly a novel foray by the Victorian authoress into the realm of the rustic. First published in 1861,this masterpiece has transcended much beyond the bars of time and even in the 21st. century retains its ambition to tell a colossal saga in a genteel fashion boldly underlined by a conversational tone. "Silas Marner" is a brief and tightly cultural story invoking a symmetrical plot and adroit symboism to depict the tale of a linen-weaver who loses everything in his life only to discover them in a more divine,vibrant and concord dimension.  Silas Marner is a poor,hapless linen-weaver who leaves his own village after being framed in a robbery case by his friend William Dane who goes on to marry his lover Sarah. Ignominy,betrayal and a haunting sense of being abjectly wronged conspire to lead him elsewhere and Silas Marner finds respite from his unforgiving past in the village of Raveloe. Here none is cognizant with his bitter history and Silas becomes a "simple weaver" and all the more enigmatic for it. He creates an atmosphere of mysteries around him and remains confined in this narrow scope of self-development for fifteen heavily limping years. He hoards up a massive amount of gold and silver but favours miserly expenditure. And then when everything gives the impression of being normal and steady,life takes a sharp bend for Silas Marner and forces him into a strange world.  Running parallel with this story of a diminutive figment of the domain of village is the gentryfolk version of a life inndated with posh manners and biting apprehensions,this too in Raveloe. Godfrey Cass is the eldest son of the Squire who succumbs to his brother Dunsey's blackmail and leaves him his horse to sell. Dunsey Cass epitomises  all that is lavish and bad and nonsense and grotesque and crooked and deceitful and cunning in a gentry society. He kills the horse in a freak accident and then to save his skin,steals the money from Silas Marner's dilapidated house. At the heart of "Silas Marner" lies his robbery---it lends an excuse to George Eliot to intersect two different,and at times poignantly contrasting,worlds and in this scheme,the reader is invariably led to ruminate on William Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice",where the two parallel stories,one concerning Antonio's plight thrusted upon by Shylock and the other describing Bassanio's endeavour to win Portia,coincide at the critical junction to shape the drama into the right posture. This comparison is not to say that Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" and Eliot's "Silas Marner" resonate with each other but goes a long way really to prove tat the intersection of the various works of literature are not that detached from the intersection of events in a single work of the same.  This robbery transmutes the eponymous protagonist of the novel from "a half-crazy miser" to a God-fearing man of depth and substance. That very same night Silas Marner's house is radiated by the return of the lost gold and silver pieces in a more divine and colourful form:"a tamp's child". Silas is bold enough to accept her as his daughter and despite being a bachelor,he undertakes for the development of the girl-child he baptises as Eppie. Eppie's growth and realisation of the world in the subsequent years spent amidst poverty and few glimpses of fortune results in Silas's own comprehension and rise from a one-dimensional figure to a pluralistic person,"There's good i' this world---I've a feeling o' that now;and it makes a man feel as there's a god more nor he can see,i' spite o' the trouble and the wickedness"---this may seem as the ultimate realisation of Silas Marner but it's not as much the understanding of Silas about life as the authoress's recurrent theme:that life,despite all the human,divine and unforseen forces perpetually thretening to distort its shape,is always beautiful.  "Silas Marner" is virtually a ballad inprose and so inevitably always soaked in a gentle reassurance of poetic justice. Throughout these pages,the reader discerns elements of ballad structure,most notably in instances where the vivid flow of the tale is punctuated by phiosophical discourse. George Eliot's general framework of things in this book is great and occasioned with touches of delicate humour and subtle satire blent with the accent of superstitions so vehemently disturbing the society during the writer's era---all these features being reflected in the conversation at the Rainbow---augment the authoress's successful employment of a taut and intense yet elaborate and defining language. George Eliot may be focusing on a particular character in this novel but she doesn't neglect the suitable etching of other characters. art is symbolic in tone with singular effigies representing wider landscapes and in "Silas Marner" this nature is made pretty evident. Geofrey Cass embodies a man repressed by circumstances and personal fears,Dunsey is the sole villain in the piece,Nancy Lammeter proves a dedicated and devoted wife to Godfrey despite illustrating herself of a meek submissive nature bordering on self-denial,whilst Dolly Winthrop is the most accomplished of women characters in the novel,a constant source of sometimes vain but forever honest judgement and help to Silas Marner.  George Eliot's language in this book is typically idyllic with a stunning coupling of narration and dialogue,the former being personal as well as philosophical and the latter neither lofty nor mundane but in essence commonplace and genuine. Dunsey's end is an apt revelation of the writer's belief that truth can never be obscured or erased. The book doesn't attempt to keep many mysteries from the reader---Eppie's father is forever a known person,Dunsey's ultimatum is never in doubt and the conclusion isn't that difficult to fathom. "Silas Marner" is not a superb classic only for the easy flow of its plot but also for the easy fairy-tale gratifications that it manages to combine with massive social and personal insights. This work must rank alongside the best novels of all time and indeed when George Eliot remarks this about Nancy's elder sister Priscillia,"She serves a little pepper to sprinkle over the talk---that's the reason why she never puts too much in her pies",we can easily qualify this statement to the authoress's ability to weave magic with her own talks and pies 
 A textbook example of how to really screw up a good thing! I use it to start a discussion in class of what to do when difficult choices come up. 
 How to describe this book? Doolittle's dexterity with our language, her soft langurous voice, the layers upon layers of depth underlying each of the stanzas? It is impossible. Having read the Greek lyrics and tragedians, and that other beacon, Shakespeare, I am still at a loss to do justice to Doolittle's "Helen in Egypt." I can only tell you one thing: read it. But if you do, do it slowly, with care and attention to each of the lines, with long pauses to allow them to sink in, and let yourself be seduced by Helen, Helena, the phantom that, real or not, launched a thousand ships, and languishes between a triumvirate of men, gods, and heroes: Zeus and Amen, Achilles and Paris and Theseus, Castor and Pollux and Clytemnestra.. 
 Blind Guardian is probably the best power metal band around, but their older albums take a decidedly more thrash metal approach. With the band's second album, 1989's Follow the Blind, you can start to see the band shift directions. Like their debut album Battalions of Fear, this is still largely a thrash album, but the band includes more melodies and more intricate arrangements. The fantasy themes are again quite prominent, and include a song about Elric (Fast to Madness) and what appears to be a Hobbit on the album cover. The album also contains one of Blind Guardian's all-time classic songs - "Valhalla" - which features legendary power metaller Kai Hansen providing guest vocals and guitars.  The album features two cover songs. The first is a cover of Demon's "Don't Break the Circle". NWOBHM purists may have a problem with this one, but I thought the band did a great job. Besides, how often do you run across a Demon cover? The second (and apparently universally hated) cover is a speed metal version of the Beach Boys' classic "Barbara Ann". I can see how metal fans would hate this song, but it totally cracks me up each time I hear it. It shows that the band knows how to have fun and doesn't take themselves too seriously, plus it takes guts to put such an absurd cover on a metal album.  Follow the Blind is still a bit rough compared to the band's later releases, and may not appeal to everyone. If you only want to hear the more refined modern power metal that the band does so well on later releases, you may want to pass on this album. If you're interested in where the band came from musically, you need to own Follow the Blind.  If you're new to Blind Guardian and are looking for a good starting point, skip this one and go straight to Imaginations from the Other Side. Once that one sinks in, listen to Nightfall in Middle Earth. It will likely become the standard by which you judge all other concept albums, if not all other power metal albums. 
 Does anyone know what the tune playing in A-Wax's car is when they drive into the underground car-park to find a car to steal?? I tried hard to make out some lyrics and search it on the web but I've had no luck so far.....any clues anybody?? 
 The book provides an excellent cross-section of letters painting a vivid picture of Van Gogh's life.  It is not an all-in-one biography, though, in  that Van Gogh makes references to work that only curators and art  historians can picture.  It would have been nice to have a black and white  thumbnail of the finished paintings as Van Gogh wrote of them 
 It is very comfortable, understandable, very good for me to study,  because this book is well structured and lots of figures 
 What exactly is your idea of Normal? Ive been reading Define Normal by Julie Anne Peters.  This book is a story of 2 adolescent teens who are total opposites , who never would of evan thought they would end up in the same room together. Antonia Renee Dillon "The Smart and Perfect One". Jasmine Luther aka Jazz." The rebellious punk one who has spiked purple hair, who is quite the opposite of Antonia. Antonia ends up being Jazz's peer counsler and shes horrified and cannot belive whats happening. Antonia feels very alone , no family, no home, and no parents is exactly how she feels.  Antonia realizes as shes spending more time with Jazz that shes really not who everyone says she is and that theirs more to her than all the wacky cloths and hair and piercings. Jazz and Antonia start to get along very well . I learned from this story that you should never judge a book by its cover or assume things without evan meeting the person. Jazz and Antonia are now extremly close friends and who would of thought that? 
 SLEEP, PALE SISTER by Joanne Harris November 3, 2005  Amazon Rating: 4/5 Stars  Fans of Joanne Harris, most famous for Chocolat, will be delighted to read this older work by the beloved author, SLEEP, PALE SISTER. Originally published in 1994, it is quite different from her more current novels.  SLEEP, PALE SISTER is a gothic novel, complete with ghosts, evil men and fainting women. Harris' taste for food is not apparent in this novel either.  Basically,  persons reading this book as their first taste of Joanne Harris will not know that this older novel is not typical of what she is known for today.  Whether that is good or bad is left up to the reader.  The novel revolves around two characters, Effie, who is introduced when she is a young impressionable girl, and Henry Chester, who is a much older man, an artist who discovers Effie and falls for her, despite their age difference.  Effie eventually marries Henry, when she is seventeen and he is in his forties, and Effie soon finds out she's made a big mistake.  Henry's ideal woman is virginal and chaste, and the act of sex disgusts him.  What Effie doesn't realize is that having sex with HER disgusts him, because he was attracted to her innocence, but his lust for women is lurking underneath his facade of purity and godliness.    Effie becomes ill quite often, especially after the miscarriage of her baby, and loses her love of life. Henry thinks she's just a typical weak woman, and lets her sleep away her days under the spell of the  laudanum he insists she ingests.  In the meantime, Henry meets Moses Harper, who becomes his protege, and Moses falls for the beautiful Effie.  He's much closer in age to Effie, and notices how unhappy she is.  The two start an affair, a dangerous deed since Henry has never hesitated to punish Effie if he felt she needed it.   Effie in turn meets Fanny Miller, a woman of ill repute who turns to Effie as if she were her own daughter. Fanny has her own secrets, one that includes Henry.  The plot thickens as the four lives become intertwined.   The book is narrated by these four characters, each insisting that their viewpoint of the story is the truth.  Henry insists that he is the one that was misunderstood, and the reader may sympathize with him for maybe a few pages, but as one gets to know him, the worse Henry will appear.    Those who love these gothic novels filled with dark overtones, paranormal beings and ladies in distress, this if for you.  The only complaint I had was that the novel I felt went on a bit too long, but at the same time, I enjoyed getting to know the characters and was very engrossed by the story, eager to know how the book would end.  It's not the typical Harris novel, so old fans be warned!  I enjoyed SLEEP, PALE SISTER a lot and would have loved to have seen Joanne Harris write more books like this 
   For the last month, I have been using this book for self study to aid me in my work with lasers.  Originally, I was working from the 1st edition (borrowed from a co-worker), but decided to buy my own copy.  I wound up buying the 3rd edition, a significantly expanded version of the original.  Goodman's writing style is conversational and his treatment of the subject is thorough.  I appreciate his inclusion of enough optics/E&M background within the text that I am not constantly having to go to my bookshelf to consult other references.  Note, the 3rd edition has several helpful appendices not found in the 1st edition.  There are also many instructive problems given throughout the text to help students solidify their understanding of the material.  This is an excellent book for self study, and would certainly make a fine text for a senior undergrad course on the subject.  I recommend it highly.  Charlie. 
 wonderful selection of images.  at home on a coffee table as well as on your night stand.  best gift for any dog lover 
 If you want to cut through my verbiage, which both expresses my perplexity with why some reviewers here think this book is ill-titled (and why I think it is perfectly titled), coupled with how I came to purchase the book myself,  skip down past the first six paragraphs. That'll take you straight to the reason why I love the book and find it worthy of its purchase price. So much so, that I'd spend the money to buy it again immediately if my lovable Springer Spaniel mistook it for his rawhide chewie on a bad hair day. That said, onward!  After receiving this book a few weeks ago and finally going through it pretty thoroughly, I am a little perplexed by some of the reviewers who think it is ill-titled. However, let me point out that before purchase, especially since these computer books tend to be so pricey even at discount, I decided to head over to the book's web site first. I downloaded the PDF file which beautifully renders the colorful Table of Contents exactly as it appears at the outset of the book. If you are contemplating purchase of this excellent book, I suggest you consider doing likewise if you have any doubts about whether it will suit your PhotoShop "finishing touches" needs and/or expectations.  So, I based my purchase loosely on reviews, but mostly on the thorough TOC PDF file, along with (and to a lesser extent), the more in-depth publisher (and Dave's) description at the book's site, which URL is listed here on the book's page on Amazon.  All of the above notwithstanding, I take no issue whatsoever with Dave's choice of titling. "Finishing Touches" means to me something you add for overall enhancement of your photo AFTER you've completed all of your photo editing and related adjustments in PhotoShop. So, in that sense, I do believe Dave has titled his book quite well ... but, then, "finishing touches" can mean a whole host of different things to different folks, I suppose.  I was looking for a book which would give me some ideas, concepts and of course some techniques and general direction about how to achieve it all in PhotoShop. I was looking for some ideas for those photos I want to do something extra-special to - most especially to some of the photos of my super-pricey wood art, where a full color product photo is included on the gallery's "artist statement" certificate which is presented to the buyer with the prototypical dating and artist's [that'd be me] sig/distinctive mark, etc.  In that sense, I found this book to be quite excellent and don't regret my expenditure for it at all. But, then, I already knew from a careful perusal of the actual ToC pretty much exactly what I buying in advance and I was not disappointed when the book arrived.  This book is and isn't, all at the same time, a "cookbook" type tutorial, but first things first: I love its visual Table of Contents with its full color mini-samples of the actual technique[s] being described and pictured. Speaking of which, quality of the cover, binding, paper and photos are all excellent. Once the reader becomes familiar with the various sections, the color-coded page edges are nice for  a quick "thumb-to" without having to reference either the TOC or index.  It's a "cookbook" in the sense that Dave presents you with a series of techniques, which are understandably heavy on border treatments since we're talking "finishing touches" here, but there is much more included as well. No matter what your level of PS experience, I'd highly recommend giving the "Key Concepts" section, some 32 pages, a good, thorough reading at the outset.  It isn't your prototypical "cookbook" type tutorial in that Dave doesn't give you fixed settings in the examples. I can't recall how many times I've read book reviewers complaints about cookbook type PhotoShop books which give them specific settings for filters, etc., but offer zero explanation for WHY the author chose those particular settings, etc. Dave doesn't do that, he encourages you to take each "recipe", so to speak, and let loose your own creativity.  If you are someone who is looking for a perfectly measured out recipe of PhotoShop steps in a "step 1, step 2, do this, set 'x' slider to 'X' value" type of recipes to achieve the techniques, this probably isn't the book for you. Dave gives you the basic concepts, but is heavy on encouraging you to use those concepts and specifics as only a "jumping off" point to unleash your own creative instincts. He's giving you concepts and techniques to get you going without binding you to a fixed set of settings and "step 1, step 2..." don't dare deviate type recipes.  This is exactly my kind of book, personally speaking. I don't like fixed steps and settings without understanding WHY what I'm doing works, but that's just me. There are so many ways to achieve the same thing in PS, that I always want to understand WHY what I'm doing works (or, conversely, doesn't work in a given circumstance).  So, if you're looking for some awesome "finishing touches" concepts that you can run with and make uniquely your own, you're going to love this book, methinks. However, if you're more inclined to how to get a specific technique accomplished without regard for why it works - and that's okay, too - this probably isn't the book you're looking for.  Above all, I highly recommend you coast over to the book's web site and download the TOC PDF file to take a look through it so you'll know what's covered and whether it meets your needs/expectations before laying out the purchase price. Because that is available online, I've not gone through a more thorough list of techniques and concepts covered - you can see it all for yourself in the excellent TOC file 
 If you don't have a clue to what the suits are doing every day between 9 and 5 read this book.  It was very insightful and an easy read 
 This is a beautiful book.  The writing is clear and beautiful and so easy to understand.  The pictures are excellent.  The yoga asana routines are exceptional.  This is one of the best yoga books i have seen ever and i have been doing yoga for a while 
 I am getting into geneology to see if we are related to Cotton Mather, the famous 18th century preacher involved with the Salem witch trials. There has always been a unproven rumor in my family that he is a cousin through my maternal great grandfather Mather's side of the family tree.  As a result, knowing nothing about geneology, but being retired and having time to do research, maybe now is the time. I therefore bought a book with the most logical title, Geneology 101, written by an accomplished and enthusiastic geneologist of her own family, Barbera Renick, to get some general idea of how to proceed and what the ground-rules are.   Barbera Reneck has spent the last 30 years looking into her family history and seems almost like an evangelist for geneology. As a result,I found that her book was more information than I was looking for; but, then again, I need the lay of the land, and too much information might not necessarily be bad. She cautions us how important it is to cross-check and analyze information; for example, it is a good idea to double-check dates to make sure a person's age at birth, marriage, first child, and death flow and coordinate properly.  Also, one should analyze the relative accuracies of the sources. A case in point is a death certificate, which is likely to be more accurate than an article in the paper covering the death, or a note in the family bible covering the death. She also recommended hooking up with a geneology society, reading geneological articles and newsletters, taking classes, and doing whatever you can do to get connected with the subject matter you are seeking.  I was a little surprised that she seemed to want to find every distant cousin and great great uncle in every branch of the family tree. Maybe I'll change my mind later, but now I am just interested in tracing my heritage back in time in a focused way, just going after direct ancestors. Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind later, and expand my research.  Since I hope to do most of my research online, I was pleased for the websites she recommended, and especially for recommending a follow-up book called Online Roots.   The book seems like a good starting point for someone new like myself.  I'll let you know later 
 Who would have guessed that Patricia Barber would be the newest entrant in the art song world? She's written in the great tradition of the 19thC and early 20thC classical composers (Schubert, Berg, Randall Thompson, etc.) but in a jazz genre that really makes sense for the material. Thanks for some really great music 
 This item is great.  It keeps my chicken upright, there is no beer can to dispose of after the chicken is cooked, no grease gets in my grill, it holds the chicken while I carve it, and it cleans up super easy.  I have recommended this product to friends and family 
           I'm not a big fan of reading, but this book just pulls you into to it. It starts as a breath taking beginning and an unpredictable ending. It's about a thirteen year old boy who was once a hero and then became a back stabber to his friends. Should he face the consequences? Should he keep the truth in him forever? If he does what will happen in his future? This coming of age story is a real page turner and you should read it. 	 
 "We'd forgive most things if we knew the facts," Assistant Police Commissioner Henry Scobie tells his wife Louise when she denounces young Pemberton, a recent suicide, for interrupting her life by requiring that her husband travel several days to investigate and report on the matter. In that simple sentence, Graham Greene captures the essence of human relationships and the kernel of his brilliant novel, THE HEART OF THE MATTER, as well as foreshadowing a host of events to follow. Not a half-page later, Greene describes his protagonist Scobie's own feelings, "He felt...the dreariness of a man who tries to write an important letter on a damp sheet and finds the characters blur."   The West Coast of Africa, Joseph Conrad's literal "heart of darkness," becomes for Graham Greene the landscape of hopelessness and despair, of lies compounded by deceit and murder. His hero, Henry Scobie, is a good man, fair and just in his handling of police matters and dealing with the ethnic carnival of Africans, Syrians, and assorted Britishers who surround him. Everyone in town knows Scobie is the only honest man thereabout. Yet it is his very honesty and desire to avoid pain in others, to manage their happiness, which causes people to despise him and his every action to backfire. He consistently confuses pity and love, living as a failed father, an adulterous husband, and a failed Catholic, a man without friends and ultimately without a God. Scobie himself ultimately recognizes that his every action, no more how well intended, results in the infliction of emotional if not physical pain on others, culminating in a tragic murder for which he was responsible even though he himself did not commit the act.   Graham Greene's coastal port is an Hieronymous Bosch setting, filled with human debris: the afflicted, the pettily pretentious, and the failed, with schemers and thieves and liars and murderers, and with those whose daily task is to convince themselves they matter for anything. Greene surrounds them with a hostile and unforgiving natural world, prone to torturous heat and endless rains and populated with all manner of symbolic death - fevers, diseases, suicides, vultures, cockroaches, lizards, ants, and mongrels. Even the streets of the town "stretched out on either side like the arms of a skeleton." Into this oppressive stew of decay he places his protagonist. Henry Scobie is a Christ figure whose forty days in the desert is passed in an incessant rainy season instead, who suffers (and succumbs) to the temptations of Satan (in the form of Helen Rolt and the Syrian, Yusef, who insists he only wants to be Scobie's friend), who questions his faith and doubts His Father's love. In the end, Scobie feels just as forsaken as Jesus on the cross. Only their resolution is different. Then again, perhaps not so different as they might seem, since Scobie justifies his climactic actions on their power to save those about whom he cared.   Yet in the end, despite all the secret messages and smuggled diamonds and human betrayals, THE HEART OF THE MATTER is a novel about one man's struggle with his Catholic faith. References to religion and religious belief permeate this book, with Scobie in particular struggling constantly to reconcile the demands of his faith with his desire to protect others. For Greene's hero, Catholicism offers nothing but impossible paradoxes. Catholics know the truth, in Scobie's estimation, and are therefore damned by their knowledge. "How often, he thought, lack of faith [in the form of Helen Rolt] helps one to see more clearly than faith." Scobie is too honest to confess behaviors he know he will repeat, yet he would rather commit mortal sin than hurt his wife Louise by admitting the truth of his adultery. "It's never good lying to oneself," Scobie tells Yusef. "One sees through the lie too easily." Finally, Scobie chooses escape and eternal damnation over confronting the mess he himself has made, ironically (for a policeman) failing miserably at what he conceived would be the perfect, face-saving crime. Heroic in his own confused mind, Scobie turns out to be as failed in life as he was in his faith. On yet another level, Scobie's tragicomic inabilities to discover the truth in his police cases or provide for the happiness of those around him offer metaphorical commentary on British (and all Western) colonial imperialism - inevitable unhappiness, harm, and even death despite the best of intentions. As Scobie himself notes, "no human being can really understand another, and no one can arrange another's happiness."   Greene's writing is masterful, creating a strong sense of place filled with a memorable supporting cast - the deviously slimy Wilson, the ineffectual Catholic priest Father Rank, the outlandishly pathetic Harris and Bagster, the dubious Yusef, the social climbing Louise, Scobie's inscrutable "boy" Ali, and of course, the widowed nineteen-year-old Helen Rolt, the obscure object of Scobie's love/pity. He creates indelible images with extraordinary economy: "His hilarity was like a scream from a crevasse," or "her face went out like a candle in a sudden draught of wind." Published in 1948, THE HEART OF THE MATTER remains thought provoking and relevant to this day and belongs on the "must read" list of all serious readers.  
 Can't believe it's been twenty years, but this movie is still just as funny today as when it came out.  Great script-a perfect cast and more laugh out loud moments than should be allowed.  How Steve Martin's character made it through this trip through hell (some times literally) without murdering his thrust upon companion is just beyond me.  The whole "you're driving the wrong way" scene is truely a classic as well as the question: 'Where is your other hand?'.  Absolutely a joy.  Highly, highly recommended 
 I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on (it's been some time now) and I plan to buy it.  Waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father.  I didn't realize when I first saw it that Reese Witherspoon was the daughter (that was before Reese Witherspoon became Reese Witherspoon).  A heartbreaking, beautifully acted and must-see film.  Rings true to life.  They certainly don't make movies like this anymore, and it's a shame 
 I've been using them for 5 years now--the SAME ONES and they're fabulous!  They're not hard at all to use (nothing like the doorknob covers--those things are annoying!) and they DO keep my children from touching the knobs, which is what they're for.  I've never had a problem with the babies pulling them off or figuring out how to open the stove AND if they go towards the stove at all it gives me that extra split second to deter them that I might not have without them.  
 The AMG guide is a major resource for anyone interested in jazz at any level. They claim that over 20,000 recordings are reviewed and I believe them!  The reviews and articles are excellent.  However to publish this new edition and keep the page-count constant with the 3rd, they have reduced the size of the type.  It can be read if one has normal sight--but with difficulty.  Older readers might well need a magnifying glass 
 Few people have spent more time observing primates than de Waal, and while most of his time is spent studying them in captivity, his keen powers of observation and knowledge of their biology make for illuminating reading. De Waal is at the peak of his powers in this, his seventh book. Our Inner Ape is packed with engaging descriptions of the social behavior of primates, mostly chimpanzees and bonobos. The author shares many insights into how our own social evolution and behaviors are akin to theirs. He also has a gift for summary statements, such as these: "It's a human irony that all that our fig leaves seem to accomplish is insatiable human curiosity," and "Humanity's special place in the cosmos is one of abandoned claims and moving goalposts."  One cannot avoid concluding that these intelligent, acutely aware apes are highly emotional, but I would like to see more emphasis placed on the importance that pleasure-seeking has on these animals' social lives, such as the intense pleasure of grooming that makes this behavior so vital as a social lubricant. Finally, de Waal is not afraid to speak his mind. Be prepared for some surprising revelations in the last chapter regarding The US's declining health and welfare status, and humankind coming off its evolutionary tracks. Highly recommended. 
 For those who like planes and decided to understand how it really works, there is still nothing better that I have seen. It comprehends basically all aspects of flying: how a big jet works, how to fly it and basics of aerodynamics and meteorology.  In the last chapter, the author vividly describes a complete flight from London to New York, depicting from the pre-flight plan up to the gate at JFK.  I strongly recommend it 
 its really a very nice movie and i want a sneak preview of i 
 For those who are still existing under the misapprehension that Wal-Mart is a benign gentle giant, "The Wal-Mart Effect" is a startling expose.  For those of you already blown away by Fishman's revelationary Fast Company article, "The Wal-Mart You Don't Know," the book is not so much an expose as a calm-gone-turbulent ride downstream. At first you're drifting along, enjoying the still waters of Wal-Mart's earnest inception and formative years, soaking up the founder's sunny aspirations and the company's refreshing consumer-oriented mission and then before you know it, an oppressive darkness has enveloped you, a raging storm has rolled in, and you find yourself spinning helplessly in a cyclone at the edge of a 50-foot drop, trying to keep your head above water and find a way to get off. At book's end, you are no longer asking "How did we get here?" but rather "How do we get out?" and "Where do we go from here?"  In true journalistic form, Fishman takes painstaking efforts to present a balanced account, outlining the positives of Wal-Mart's effect--its cost savings for consumers, its distribution and packaging genius, its humble, no-frills headquarters and persona, and its even, unbiased expectations for all of its suppliers. But it is Fishman's disclosure of how Wal-Mart now achieves its low-price policy--the wave after wave of personal story after personal story of the struggling U.S. manufacturers and suppliers, their wage-starved or pink-slipped employees, bankrupted ethical competitors, tax-deprived towns, and overburdened social agencies wrecked in the Titan's tempestuous wake--that is the book's true mark of greatness.  Like a Steinbeck novel, The Wal-Mart Effect is profound in its simplicity. Fishman demonstrates an uncanny ability to make clear that which should already be obvious, but isn't; you open your eyes and say "How did I not see this before?!"  By focusing on Wal-Mart and the mentality it embodies, Fishman shines a brilliant spotlight on our American values--bargains over jobs; excess over ethics, the golden calf over the stony tablets.  If knowledge is power, "The Wal-Mart Effect" is Herculean in its potential to turn back the tide of American blind allegiance to low price at any cost. 
 Robert Simmons and Naisha Ahsian offer wonderful insight into the metaphysical world of crystals, minerals and gemstones. I design my jewelry using specific stones to convey a feeling or message. This book has been an inspiration to begin a wonderful journey 
 this bag is awesome.  i use it to take a ton of books and sometimes my computer to and from the library and work.  It can weigh up to 25 lbs, and the straps still hold the weight with out any signs of breaking down.  the best part though is that the bottom of the bag is square so it stands upright, making it easy to access everything inside of it.  I also like the orange color 
 Contrary to some reviewers, I felt the background of American atrocities added depth and understanding to the book. Does it make excuses for what the Japanese did? Absolutely not. Does it provide a framework for understanding the thinking of the people of that era? Yes. Just understanding the concept of "bringing civilization to the world" in both American and Japanese eyes is important. All too often we put ourselves on a the golden throne and never want to admit that we have been cruel to those we dominated. This book provides a very personal look at a few young men that lived and died for their country. It also provides graphic detail about the attrociites of war waged by a society ruled by fear of reprisal. A real eye-opener 
 I have already finished courses in strength of materials etc., and am using this book as a reference, instead of those voluminous handbooks. The book is very well written and William Nash has an excellent, straight  forward way of putting forth the key points. The book has all the  information you might need for a first course in strength of materials. I  also use this book in conjunction with a finite element text to give me the  theoretical values for comparison. In summary, if you need a solid backup  for your textbook and a useful reference, you won't go wrong with this one 
 Malcolm Boyd's Bach is nearly a classic at this point.  It's a fair read, but frankly it leaves me a little flat.  It's okay, but truth be told, Karl Geiringer's Bach is far, far better 
 In the beginning there were the books, the Best-Seller lists were over-run, and God said, "This is good".  Now have come the movie adaptations.  I saw this one in the theatre, and was impressed, and entertained.  I was never interested in the books, not being the most religious sort, but I love well done religious themed films.   The Classic B-Movies of the 30's to the 60's have many elements in common with this film: Interesting Plot, complete with holes, and a message. A cheap budget that means cheap ( but good )effects, and sets, not to mention interesting location shooting choices, and lesser known, and unknown actors.   The actors are committed to their craft, and the talent displayed ranges from Awful to Oscar ( well, ok, maybe not, but still some very inspired performances ) and, if you are lucky you get a recognizable actor with a history of quality work ( Kirk even backs the message, and is committed to the series, and Lou Gossett Jr. appears in the 3rd film! ).  Enjoy this film for what it is, and you will have wasted an enjoyable couple of hours.   
 The co-author's prior work, "The Millionaire Next Door" is better.  This work is also very good in that it gives more data on the average millionaire, showing that millionairedom is not out of anyone's reach.  However, though the data he presents states that over 90% of millionaires are college grads, his book is disproporionately rich in anecdotes of high school drop-outs that became millioinaires.  Also, he deals largely in absolute numbers.  Though he states that the majority of millionaires are business owners and entrepreneurs, not physicians, CPA's or attorneys, he fails to address the PERCENTAGE of business owners that are millionaires, vs. the PERCENTAGE of attorneys, physicians, etc. that are millionaires.  This additional data would be helpful for those still deciding on a career.  Despite this, the principles in this book are sound and overall it is a worthwhile read.  One doesn't need to be an academic "Superstar" to become a millionaire as he clearly shows 
 I really enjoyed Dance of Death. It was well researched and well-written. Kimberly Poole and John Boyd Frazier were somewhat familiar to me, for I had remembered the case from Court TV. But, at the time, it wasn't interesting. Now that I have read Dance of Death, I can shoot myself for not paying attention to the case. Maybe it was the way the author told this story, but this story ranks with my all time high true crime books. I couldn't put the book down and was glued to every word on every single page. Dale Hudson is very good at this. In reading true crime, I have found there are people who know how to write and there are some people who can tell a good story, but I haven't found as anyone as good as Dale Hudson. He can write and tell a good story at the same time! 
 this movie is a great movie for those how like movie on millitary and sub's. this movie keeps u thinking all the way through it and wondering what will happen next.Sean Connery as always was a great actor in this film and so was Alec Baldwin. I would just sugest it to just about anyone and definetly military lovers.  
 Wow, I was totally moved by this book.  The story telling was so good it was like a movie playing out in my head.  It teaches a very valuable lesson.  And I couldn't put it down - cover to cover without stopping. It's well written, quick read.  For all ages, I'm going to have my 12 year old read it - maybe he'll learn something.  And yes, I bawled at the end. 
 In Breaking Silence: the Case that Changed the Face of Human Rights Richard Alan White tells the story of the family tragedy that led to the ground-breaking case of Filartiga v. Peòa.  The case affirmed that the US court system provides protection to aliens who are victims of human rights abuses that cannot be redressed in the countries where the abuses occurred.   Elegantly written, Breaking Silence is a page-turner that should appeal to any reader.  It's a great gift book because, published by a university press, it is not yet widely known.    The details of  the Filartiga story come alive because White himself was part of the drama.  While he was a graduate student living and studying in Paraguay, Richard Alan White became a close friend of a Paraguayan doctor, Jose Filartiga, and his family.  A deep friendship continued long after White's return to the United States.  When Dr. Filartiga's son was tortured and murdered by authorities, Dr. Filartiga contacted White instead of ignoring the torture/murder, as Paraguayan custom and politics dictated.   White immediately flew to Paraguay to be with his friends.  Breaking Silence is a story of the resulting search for justice.  	Not only will this book appeal to lawyers and others familiar with the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Filartiga case, but also to those working or otherwise interested in the field of human rights.   The book has special importance for those who hope to work in an NGO or to work internationally at the grass-roots level, because it shows how committed individuals can learn to  use governmental systems to make a difference.  It should be a must-read for students.       Breaking Silence recently received an "Outstanding Book" rating from theAmerican Association of University Presses Books Committee.  University presses published 6,000 books this past year, and Breaking Silence was only one of six political science books to receive this award.        A longer review of this book is the feature story in Lawyers Weekly USA, April 26, 2005: "Family Tragedy Leads to Revival of Pirate Law." 
 I have tried a few other photo editing products but I always come back to Adobe.  Easy to use and excellent results 
 Both my 5 & 3 year-old children LOVE this book.  It is a nice combo of something fun (the pinatas, the design, & just the thought of candy...) and reality (photos of Don making pinatas).  It is simple enough for them to understand, and captivating enough for even my younger child.   We haven't delved much into the spanish text, but will eventually. For now, we're working on making the star for my daughter's sixth birthday party 
 This is probably the best novel written in the Arab world . Writers who tried to mimic it later on like El Aswany in "The Yacoubian Building" were cheap, inexpressive and failed.  Mahfouz offers a profound exploration of his characters; their struggles, inconsistencies, turbulent thoughts and actions.  Desire can force them to act against their will and conviction. Their weaknesses compel them to act tyrannical under a vague definition of tradition. And the hardships they face change them beyond their comprehension forcing them into abodes of disturbed philosophical thought. The novel is perfectly interrelated marking the beginning, end, and evolution of each character, place or event mentioned.  The book starts by recounting the mature and established life of Ahmed Abd El Jawad and his wife Amina. He is a tyrannical patriarch, exerting full domination over his family, drawing strict restrictions over their lives while enjoying a sexually corrupt life on his own in prostitute houses.   Until the last pages of the first book the Abd El Jawad family is only suffering from domestic problems that stem from the casual daily life, like Khadija's fear of spinisterhood due to her ugly nose, Fahmy's political life and his love to his neighbour, Mariam,Abd El Jawad's cruelty and compassion to Amina etc... However towards the end, in the last few pages the family is stricken by its first major tragedy: Fahmy's death. This tragedy had major everlasting implications which changed their lives forever.  The second novel marks the eventual changes that occurred to the family. The father's tyrannical image is diminished gradually. Kamal's friends are members of the educated elite society. He falls madly in love with his best friend's sister. His platonic adoration reminded me of Florentino Ariza in "Love in the Time of Cholera". They both almost worshipped their beloved who belonged to an upper middle class and ignored them. The description of the lovers' feelings at the wedding night is also highly parallel. Kamal's personality was formulated by two major incidences that took place in his life: his failure in love and his brother's death. His ideological confusion and abnormal life and behavior stemmed from them.  In El Sokariya the old Abd El Jawad hierarchy entirely falls apart and each of the grand-children formulates his own life. It reflects the political segmentation, ideological changes and the corruption of the time.  "Time" as a theme is wonderfully discussed in the Cairo trilogy. Former centers of authority lose their respect gradually and become objects of humiliation and disintegration. Kamal carries his father like a child in the last day of his life, participates in Aida's humble funeral and chooses not to marry her sister. She who used to be once adored and unreachable. The last part is particularly interesting when Yassin goes to buy things for his daughter's upcoming baby and a black tie for his stepmother's upcoming funeral.  Politics also forms an integral role in the novel and it goes through the change process as much as anything. At the beginning Fahmy dies as a Wafdist, and by time the Wafd becomes less popular and Khadija's sons are imprisoned for the new sparkling political currents: the Muslim Brotherhood and Communism.  Ahmed Shawkat marks at the end that an individual is obliged to two kinds of responsibilities: his responsibility towards his family and his political and ideological responsibility towards his country.   Kamal accepts his advice and plans to think about the truth behind it.  A perfect picture of the Egyptian life at that time and the general condition of human beings immersed in a social atmosphere. 
 The CD's were fabulous.  My granddaughter loves listening to them and I have to admit, I do too 
 I am an Executive Coach with clients in Fortune 50 companies and I've led development efforts both as an internal coach as well as an external consultant.  Despite my own experience in coaching, I found Debra Benton's book "Secrets of a CEO Coach" personally insightful and rewarding.  After trying  several of Debra's questioning techniques with my clients, I could quickly see the value.  In an age of speed, this book is well worth your time.  It can add value to the coach as well as the client.  Thanks Debra.  Job well done 
 Me being a child of the 80's I remember watching the TV movie about it....growing up in a Catholic School made it even worse. Ritual Abuse is one of those things that unfortunatly does exist but it's not as precedent as one might think...A very very close and recent case of Ritual Abuse happened to one Rev. Sonath of the Order of Perdition...(Now gone thank god) the esteemed "Satanist" priest molested his 12 yr old daughter in ritual abuse. Google Search it if you think I am kidding. He was also in an episode on americas most wanted. The book itself is a good read with a lot of prevalent facts and case files but like I said...it's out there you just have to know where to look....no card carrying member of the CoS would likely admit to it...but a lot of the "denominations" currently held in the satanic church practice it without anyone knowing.. 
 Probally the greatest under dog story of all time. the dvd's themselves dont come with many extras but for the price it is by far the best deal in town 
 Imagine being trapped in a town you have never been in before, with a group of people you just met.  Now add to that a crazy pyschopath has told you all that you have to kill the "ugliest person" in the group in order to survive. What if the "ugliest person" is the cop who is trying to save you?  If you don't do what he says he will kill people in the town. What do you do?    Once again Dekker delivers twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  He manages to through curves that keep you guessing.  This book is definitely worth the read.  
 about colors and chakras and their meanings. References to diseases from homeophatic view. Introduction to writer's self developed homeopathic color remedies. I found this as good first-step to colors, which are examined from physical, emotional etc. ways. This would also give new ideas for  homeopaths  
 THESE SHOES ARE EXTREMELY CONFORTABLE and CARRY A TRUE SIZE.  MINE ARE GREEN AND ONE OF THEM IS NOT DIED PROPERLY, IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER BUT NEVERTHELESS, I WOULD BUY THEM IN ALL COLORS IF THEY WERE MADE.  VERY HAPPY WITH THE 
 Clearing the eye is a true caption of isis live. I have seen them play in cambridge mass at the middle east and the shows captured remind me of that time. the sound quality is quality. sounds as if removed directly from the sound board. The dvd quality is also very good. 
 I am a fairly recent reader of Carla Neggers' work.  When I first picked up one of her books, I quickly found as many of her past works as possible in my favorite used book store. Once read; I had to wait anxiously for her next book.  I wasn't disappointed in her latest, Dark Sky.  It was an exciting, nail biting adventure. Although I was able to figure out who the "bad guy" was fairly early on; it was still a great book to get lost in! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romantic suspense 
 As late as last week (September 18) George Strait took Bill Anderson's co-written "Give It Away" to #1 on the country charts. It continued a success timeline Anderson has enjoyed as songwriter, singer, TV and radio show host and guest for the better part of 50 years, peaking in his being named to the Country Music Hall of Fame and honored as one of its top three all-time songwriters.  Yet "The Definitive Collection," capturing 20 hits from Anderson's hit-making years (1963-78), doesn't quite tell the story of his talents and influence. To be sure, this set features some great songs: "Tips of My Fingers" was a country standard in the 1960s whose 1992 revival by Steve Wariner revived Anderson's second hit songwriting era. The tragicomic "Po' Folks," "Walk Out Backwards," and "Wild Weekend," are literate,   funny countrypolitan songs whose wordplay speaks to Anderson's previous journalism career.  (Anderson wrote nearly all the songs here, most produced by Owen Bradley in his "Nashville Sound" style.)  But while his dramatic songs became country classics for Lefty Frizell ("Saginaw, Michigan") and Porter Wagoner ("I'll Go Down Swingin," "Cold, Hard Facts of Life") Anderson whispered (with near-perfect annunciation) a series of ever more maudlin spoken word top 10 hits to his own audience. These included 1963's pop and C&W Top 10 "Still," to "8 x 10," to 1977's smooth "Liars One, Believers Zero." (The most cloying of these, 1964's "Five Little Fingers," prompted my 9-year-old to ask, "Is he supposed to be singing from heaven?") These, plus 1978's country-disco self-parody, "I Can't Wait Any Longer," showed Anderson wasn't above following music trends where they'd lead him.  Despite these occasional missteps, Bill Anderson has earned his place among country's greats and successor to Roy Acuff as a Grand Old Opry ambassador. Here's hoping MCA expands this collection into their 2CD "Gold," series, capturing not only these hits (and overlooked gems like "Bright Lights and Country Music") but the many songs he's written for two generations of country performers. For its faults, "Defintive Collection" is a worthwhile, superb-sounding buy for any traditional country fan.        
 I came of political age during the early civil rights struggle here in America in the 1960's. Part and parcel with that awakening struggle came an increased interest in the roots of the black struggle, especially in slavery times. Such intellectuals as Herbert Apteker, Eugene Genovese, the Foners, Harold Cruise, James Baldwin and others, black and white, were very interested in exploring or discovering a black resistance to the conditions of slavery not apparent on any then general reading of the black experience in America. This is the place where the recently deceased William Styron and his novelistic interpretation of one aspect of that struggle- Nat Turner's Virginia slave rebellion enters the fray.   No Styron is not politically correct in his appreciation of Turner or his followers. Nor are latter day whites who have recoiled in horror at what expansion of Turner's rebellion might have meant for the `peculiar institution'. But being p.c., etc. now or historically is beside the point. Slavery was brutal. Slavery brutalized whole generations of black people for a very long time. If one expects nature's noblemen and women to come out of such a process, one will be very sadly mistaken. That the white benificaries of this system were brutalized is a given. Human progress has come about through fits and starts not a seamless curve onward and upward.  But, here are some things to think about if you are not worried about your political correctness status. Outside of John Brown at Harper's Ferry Turner's rebellion represented the highest achievement of resistance to the white slaveholders in the early 19th century. Although the fight was not pretty on either side every progressive today should stand in historical solid airy with that fight. Then one will understand not only that oppression oppresses but also that the military conditions for a successful rebellion for blacks in pre- Civil War American were slim. 200, 000 black soldiers and sailors in the Civil War are a very, very profound argument that once off the plantation blacks were as capable of bravery, courage and honor as an other American, Read on.   
 As a Chicago resident, I am a big fan.  This is our magnificent U.S. Senator from the great State of Illinois.  And this web page says it all about what I think of this book and Senator Obama: http://www.billslater.com/who_is_barack_obama.htm Read the book and check out his speeches.  You will see why I am praying for this brilliant leader to be U.S. President someday.  And may that day come sooner than later.  God Bless Senator Obama and his Family 
 Bejan's book may look polemic because all the topics in convection heat transfer he had to review, and sometimes correct some "historically assumed" mistakes. There is detailed physical explanation of every phenomena. There are very few good books in heat transfer in the market. This is the best 
 More like a workbook, we admire the way this book breaks away from the usual war mode and into the strategy realm.  Sun Tzu, though it does show you how to prepare for battle, prefers that war is not implemented if not  for preservation's sake.  This book's print quality could be better but it  is very well organized with profound analyses. Broken down verse by verse  and separated by each area of interaction (personal, interpersonal, group)  you can tell the author really took the effort to have the reader  understand and apply every concept.  Wow. You'll be glad you bought it.   Sonshi.co 
 This book comes from a time when hunters and conservationists were in league with each other. Many of the tips he gives are not appropriate for parks but are still useable on PRIVATE land. Not for effete tree hugger  types 
 Tim Russert is a great journalist and this book is a great resource for ideas and suggestions on how to be a better dad.  In fact there is something in this book for everyone no matter what your relationship with your father is or was. The most precious things a father can provide are time, attention, and love.  This book makes the reader sit back and appreciate the little things only you and your dad know. Great work! Keep it up, Tim!  -- I also watch most of Tim's TV programs. 
 Everytime the film version of this James Patterson book is run on cable TV, I just love to sit and watch the entire 4-hour adventure.  Tracey Pollan, did a great job as police office Lindsay Boxer, and the movie was very fast-paced without getting as detailed as Patterson's book.  Well, I have finally read the book, and am eternally grateful they left certain details of the crime scenes out of the movie, because they were pretty disgusting.  I would also like to say, as another reviewer pointed out, that the ending wasn't too good, but the movie did it a favor.  Now, why couldn't Patterson have thought of that version himself?  Still, a really good crime thriller with lots of great twists and turns.     
 THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE TO WATCH FOR EITHER THE SPECIAL EFFECTS OR THE SUPER DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND, OR  THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY SOUND TRACK, THIS IS A MUST HAVE MOVIE TO HAVE FOR EITHER A FAMILY NIGHT MOVIE OR JUST FOR FUN.......BUY IT AND ENJOY IT.......... 
 The ideas are outstanding. Actually getting the pictures to come out that way take some work which was a great challenge for my son and I 
 Parade touches so many different stylings and music boundaries that it's considered by most fans as the pre-cursor to his creative masterpiece, Sign 'O' the Times. If anything, this album told everybody that he and The Revolution could do alot more than the average  band, especially with Prince at the helm.  Being the final Revolution album, there's definitely plenty of "bang" throughout. A funky, quirky, European-bound valentino in Prince leads the listener on a musical joyride. Jumping from style to style within the first 6 minutes of the album! From "Christopher Tracy's Parade" to "Under the Cherry Moon," you will be hooked.  Tracks like the dancible "Girls & Boys," the definitive Revolution song in "Mountains," the #1 single "Kiss," the funky "Anotherloverholenyohead," and the tear-filled "Sometimes It Snows In April" will have you spinning this album countless times. Especially for the Prince fan in all of us 
 I am a Nigerian born American, and have lived in the US for 40-years.  This is the first book I have ever read from the SLAVES point of view.  I have been married for 30-years to an American born African American, and  this book, for the first time, explains to me why my 91-year old  mother-in-law who lives with us could not watch the movie "Color  Purple" or the PBS broadcast of Africans in America.  I can now  associate the Black American in the street as someone from my village in  Nigeria.  I am humbled by the humiliation and suffering which was  perpetrated on my people for no other reason than the color of their skin.   This book must be read by all recent African immigrtants to the US, all  heads of African Governments, as well as all editors of African news  organizations, in the hope that the respective African country shall adopt  this book as a required reading in African schools.  I make this  recommendation because any history of slavery, whatsoever, as taught in the  African schools today, was written in the last 100-years, with the point of  view of the SLAVEMASTER.  The respective modern day African country has no  record of Slavery in America from 1450 to 1900.  Worse yet, all the  conditions that lead to tribal conflict and genocide exist today in many  parts of Africa. Those who have no sense of history will repeat the   mistakes of yester-years.  This should be the beginning of a new dialogue  among Africans and African Americans 
 Superb photography, amazing subjects. Very interesting essay by Susan Sontag. Great to see all those wonderful women together. Gives a fresh perspective on half the human race 
 The media was co-opted by the elites and the global corporate groups many many years ago. The viewer and the reader will never be able to get an accurate and objective view of events from their newspaper or television set. The corporate media has become an intrinsic organ of the new breed of the hybrid ruler that is half politician and half corporation. Chomsky's book is a good eye opener for the media blind. It's a book worth reading........ 
 Tom Wolfe is praised as a brilliant social novelist and I don't read enough of that type of novel to comment on the success of A Man in Full.  I have read Bonfire of the Vanities and now this book, and I found them both to be quite enjoyable.  A Man in Full is similar to Bonfire with sprawling chapters full of thoughts and descriptions of the main characters.  This book is set in Atlanta, where Charlie Croker is an aging real estate developer and former football star.  Croker's financial empire is on the verge of collapse and his personal life isn't going to well either.  As with Bonfire, Wolfe writes about the polically connected, race politics and the very wealthy.  Charlie Croker and friends judge others based on the amount of money they have and the material possessions they own.  Using this criteria to judge others is obviously foolish to all except the most materialistic.  Except for Conrad Hensley, the Croker employee arrested for assault, the poorest main character is a banker named Peepgas who has a Harvard MBA and makes $120,000 a year.  Needless to say, the social arena Wolfe writes about is above that of most readers.  That doesn't mean the book isn't entertaining.  I enjoyed all of the characters and their interaction.    When an all-American African American football player at Georgia Tech is suspected of rape, racial tension threatens to destroy Atlanta.  Croker is about to lose all his possessions to his creditors and his sexy wife half his age isn't too thrilled about it.  Roger White is the black lawyer called on by the black mayor to see if he can get the crusty old Croker to speak out.  Conrad Hensley is the Croker employee who is fired then thrown in jail.  All the plots slowly converge.  This book isn't about action, its about characters.  I give this book 4 stars because it was a satisfying journey with some enjoyable characters.  I was frustrated a few times by how what was important in life was so obvious yet Charlie Croker never did quite get it.  His good ole boy attitude was amusing at times but amazingly ridiculous at others.  It was sometimes appalling how attached he was to appearances and his possessions.  About halfway through the book, I browsed some reviews on Amazon.  A few said they were terribly disappointed in an ending that felt tacked on and that there wasn't any resolution to the plot or to some of the characters.  I disagree.  The book ends by resolving the point that the entire book led up too.  We are given a few sentences about the fate of some of the other characters.  For Wolfe to write entire chapters about everyone else would have taken another 200 pages.  The ending is not disappointing and you won't be let down.  Every loose end might not get the attention you think it deserves, but I give Wolfe the benefit of the doubt and accept this as the story he wanted to tell.   
 I had always wanted to find out more about the famous 'Mrs. Kennedy'. I picked this one and found it hard to put it down. From her chilhood to the time she died, Spoto writes in a delightful fashion that is easy to read and understand. After reading this touching and heartwarming portrayal of America's Royal, she became one of my favorite people. It includes quotes from her close friends and indulges you in her charity projects and her relationship with Caroline and John Jr. It tells of her deep love for JFK and the loyalty she had to her family. The only thing I disliked about the book was the beginning, which was like reading the beginning of the Bible. It told all about her ancestors history and was quite boring in my opinion. Aside from that though, this is a great book which helped spawn my interest in Jackie 
 This book should be in the library of every woman.  This book teaches you to fight with prayer and action for your children, your marriage, your family!  Keep it with your Bible and learn spiritual warfare.  Your family needs your prayer, they need Jesus.  Use it!! 
 Once his second Lp, "Word of Mouf" dropped and sailed to the top of the charts, Ludacris became one of the most popular and talked about rappers of the new millenium.  In 2002 he brought his group into the game with their album, "Golden Grain" which went on to sell over 500,000 copies.  But now in 2003 it's time for Luda to step back in the lime light riding solo again with the release of his 3rd album, "Chick-N-Beer."  1. Southern Fried (Intro) - 4/5  2. Blow It Out - 4.5/5  3. Stand Up (Featuring Shawnna) - 4/5  4. Rob Quarters (Skit) - No Rating  5. Splash Waterfalls - 3/5  6. Hard Times (Featuring Eightball, MJG & Carl Thomas) - 4.5/5  7. Diamond in the Back - 3/5  8. Screwed Up (Featuring Lil' Flip) - 4.5/5  9. T Baggin' (Skit) - No Rating  10. P-Poppin' (Featuring Shawnna & Lil' Fate) - 4.5/5  11. Hip Hop Quotables - 4.5/5  12. Black Man's Struggle (Skit) - No Rating  13. H*** in My Room (Featuring Snoop Dogg) - 4/5  14. Teamwork - 4/5  15. Interactive (Skit) - No Rating  16. We Got (Featuring Chingy, I-20 & T*** Boi) - 4.5/5  17. Eyebrows Down (Featuring T*** Boi & Dolla Boy) - 5/5  Overall:  54/65  4 Stars  Ludacris really surprised me with this album.  On some of these tracks he took a different approach in structuring them like "Splash Waterfalls", "Screwed Up" and "Diamond in the Back" and for the most part it was a bad decision.  But Luda definitely brings the heat like expected when it comes to production and lyrics.  
  D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) deeply troubles me as a white caucasian.  The opening and closing scenes hint at a movie that will make a serious statement against all wars.  And the battle scenes in part one, including hospital recovery, are superb.  This is a movie that has the power to move and enrage audiences 92 years after it was made, so I consider it an important film classic.  I particularly am moved by hero Henry B. Walthall's return home from war to his sweetheart Mae Marsh, the scenes with Abraham Lincoln, and the impeccable re-creation of Ford's Theater on the night Lincoln was shot.  Miriam Cooper and Lillian Gish are also unforgettably poignant. So there is a lot to recommend to even black audiences nowadays, mostly in part one.  If only Griffith had stopped at the 85 minute intermission point, he would have had a true masterpiece.  What on earth was he thinking in the remaining 100 minutes when he turns the movie into infuriating melodrama and the cinema of propaganda?  (The Kino archive print I watched, the definitive one to buy or rent, runs 187 minutes, with color tinting and an orchestra score.)  The Civil War is over, and the black characters are in control (and mostly played by white actors in blackface).  The blacks are in control of Congress, will not let whites vote, and unwittingly kill the lovely (white) Mae Marsh character.  The logical and needed solution, for Griffith, is to have Walthall form the Ku Klux Klan to avenge his sweetheart's death and let the South not be under the power of the evil and all-powerful blacks.  This is when BIRTH OF A NATION becomes the infuriating cinema of propaganda.  I found myself getting all worked up and wanting all blacks on screen to meet a violent death.  When a whole army of KKK riders faces down a whole street of blacks, you cheer for the KKK  to kill all the blacks and restore order.  And they eventually do.  BIRTH OF A NATION is a powerful and important film, despite its disturbing racism, because of its vast scope and its brilliant filmmaking.  It maintains interest for over three hours, has beautifully drawn and heartbreaking white major characters (again, especially, the three women), stunning battle scenes on a movie determined to make a timely statement to end all wars forever, and parallel cutting between blacks and whites in the admittedly exciting climax.  I'm not sure, but I think parallel editing was invented here, along with iris camerawork.  (All you see on screen is a circle or some other geometric shape.)  And there is again the mammoth length--187 minutes, plus intermission--at a time when Keaton was not yet on screen and Keystone was making 20-25 minute slapstick comedies with Chaplin and Arbuckle.  Griffith, with BIRTH, basically invented the modern cinema; and 92 years later we are still arguing over its merits and admittedly finding its pro-KKK climax blood-racingly exciting because of Griffith's melodramatic storytelling.  You are not allowed to cheer for the blacks.  The NAACP will not allow BIRTH OF A NATION to be shown theatrically anymore.  Too bad.  As a white guy I'd love to see it with a predominately black audience.  Fortunately, we can still see it on DVD versions ranging from only 90 minutes, to Kino's definitive 187 minute roadshow version with color tinting and an orchestra score.  Kino also gives us the 1930 chat with D. W. Griffith and Walter Huston on Griffith's intentions with BIRTH; a 25 minute behind-the-scenes documentary; scenes from the roadshow souvenir program; fascinating legal/censorship records; and several Griffith Civil War shorts he made at Biograph Studios before BIRTH.  Watch BIRTH OF A NATION with a sober head, some intelligence, and in the greatest possible print.  92 years later it is a masterpiece of propaganda that still has the power to enrage, excite, disturb, and move modern audiences as few silent films do.  
 I have read several books and heard countless speakers on this difficult and confusing topic. I have to say, this book by Dr. Tan, is the most intelligent and well balanced book on the sudject to date. I recommend it to anyone who is considering getting involved in this area in one's local church. I also recommend it to any pastor considering starting up a Lay Counseling program in his/her own church. This is a very difficult and emotionally laden topic to discuss, and Dr. Tan has done a superb job. Well Done 
 This is the correct tuner to add to my stereo unit, but a bit pricey when you compare it to the portables out there. With the portable units you can switch from home stereo to car stereo using one account. With this unit you only get one account and cannot use it for a stereo care unit. Therefore, I had to pay for two subscriptions 
  'Stop the Show' is truly as its subtitle implies - insane and absurd and very hilarious. A friend bought it for me and I went out a bought a few for my theatrical friends. It's a great gift and a great gift for yourself.  
 If anyone could write a book about the power of praying, it is Stormie Omartian.  If you pray at all, you will want to read this book. It will encourage you to strengthen your prayer habit.  If you are curious about the benefits of prayer, or exactly how to go about it, this book is for you. You will be instructed and encouraged to develop a personal prayer habit. Once you develop this personal prayer habit, you will indeed experience the truth that there is power in prayer. Another great job, Stormie 
 This is a very nice cd. Like the first album it has music for all generations to feel and relate to. Soulful songs created by a husband and wife, so you can feel the love and meaning in each song. Definitely mature music for a mature mind. Kindred is  a group everyone should support to encourage them to keep making good music 
 I have been in print publishing for a little over 2 years and this book has tremendously helped me. I am still learning things in the print world and this book has been a great reference for me. There are so many variables to remember in print media and it is great to have a resource that can give you assurance with your projects. It can also give you ideas and guidance when beginning a project and trying to decide what direction the piece should go. This book is a "must have" for any graphic designer's library. 
 After finishing this book I was sorry I hadn't read Haddon's first story.  The man had me laughing out loud one minute and deep in thought the next.  I wonder how many people would react as George Hall, the protaganist of the book, did when confronted with an unexpected lesion exactly upon retirement.  Hall's fears may indeed be signs of madness but Haddon had me thinking that perhaps more of us are similarly inclined than we admit.  I doubt very few would resort to self-surgery at the level described, but many of us do hack away at our problems without the proper tools.   Haddon's description of Hall dealing with his wife's love affair was another example of Haddon being able to see beneath the veneers of social behaviors and make a sad situation humorous.  All in all, I can't wait to go back and read his first book, "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time."  
 I've had this book in my arsenal for almost 20 years and refer to it almost monthly.  Legendary ad man John Caples escorts you through the foundation of copywriting.  This book is primarily about writing direct response copy, but I have found it useful in all areas of copywriting.  When I need some thought stimulators for writing a headline, I pull out Tested Advertising Methods.  Don't let the age of the book deter you from receiving its benefits 
 This excellent book goes over the different styles of artist books. Each chapter is an in-depth look at each style, with plenty of examples. The material is well-organized and easy to read without sacrificing academic  rigor. This book has introduced me to the various approaches in making  artist books. This book would be good either for the artist book  aficionado, the art history student interested in artist books, or the  serious book maker 
 "Water" is the third film in writer/director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy, following "Fire" and "Earth". It explores the plight of widows in traditional Hindu culture, where women are condemned to a grim, rudimentary existence after their husbands die. Driven by characters as much as by its cause, this is not a bleak film. On the contrary, "Water" is breathtakingly beautiful. In India in 1938, young Chuyia (Sarala) is widowed at the age of 8. By religious law, when a man dies, his wife may either be cremated with him, marry his brother, or live the life of an ascetic -chaste, poor, and pious. Chuyia's head is shaved, her jewelry removed, and she is sent to live in an ashram with other widows of all ages. She is befriended by a pretty widow named Kalyani (Lisa Ray), watched over by the devout and generous Shakuntula (Seema Biswas), and often at odds with the ashram's callous matriarch Madhumati (Manorama), who pays the rent by prostituting Kalyani. A handsome law student with progressive politics, Narayan (John Abraham), is smitten by Kalyani. But it is sinful for widows to remarry, and Kalyani is a prostitute besides.  The story of making "Water" is a drama in itself. Filming in India in 2000 was shut down by violent protests by religious fundamentalists, who believed the film was anti-Hindu. Deepa Mehta's view is that a misinterpretation of religious texts has perpetuated the dreadful state of widows in Indian culture, which is actually the result of economics. If a widow is sent away upon the death of her husband, her own family does not have to pay to feed or house her, and her would-be inheritance remains in her husband's family. In any case, there were riots, Deepa Mehta was burned in effigy, and the film's sets were thrown into the river. Four years later, the film was recast and the production moved to Sri Lanka, where filming began again. All of the temples and buildings that you see are sets by production designer Dilip Mehta. Sarala, who plays Chuyia, is Sri Lankan and does not speak a word of Hindi. She learned all of her lines phonetically. Somehow that doesn't even seem odd amid this international cast and creative crew.   Giles Nuttgens' cinematography is a force in this film. Everything appears so alive and luminous that I wanted to step into this world to be bathed in its beautiful light and touch its delicate features. The light has a striking purity. The film's score by Canadian Mychael Danna and songs by Indian composer A.R. Rahman are an ideal auditory accompaniment to "Water"'s visual splendor. Although it focuses our attention on the plight of widows in India, "Water" is not a realistic film on the narrative level. Kalyani and Narayan are idealized characters. She is pure, lovely, and suffering. He educated, and socially progressive. To Narayan, Kalyani is a romantic figure, a fragile, innocent soul in need of rescuing. The idea that a wealthy, educated man would want to marry an illiterate peasant prostitute who will never understand his causes or his world view seems far-fetched. But Kalyani's reticence and Narayan's sensitivity draw us in. Narayan is a change of pace for John Abraham, who is an Indian supermodel and Bollywood star. Lisa Ray is Canadian, also a supermodel in India, but Hindi is not her first language. Director Deepa Mehta has a real talent for casting the perfect actors from seemingly unlikely choices.  For all of Kalyani and Narayan's beauty and sympathy, "Water" is not their film. Shakuntula is the character who has an arc, and Seema Biswas gives the film's great performance. She personifies the conflict between conscience and faith that is at "Water"'s core. (You many remember Seema Biswas from her lead role in "Bandit Queen".)  Manorama, who has acted in an extraordinary 1301 movies, is memorably sharp as the matriarch Madhumati. Professor of Hindi literature Dr. Vidula Javalgekar plays the kindly, sweet-toothed, elderly widow Patiraji, a woman who must be very unlike herself. "Water" is simply a gorgeous sensory experience that movie-lovers won't want to miss. In Hindi (and some Sanskrit) with English or Spanish subtitles or English captions.  The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): "Behind the Scenes" (20 min) includes interviews with writer/director Deepa Mehta and the cast. Mehta talks about the controversy surrounding the film and its themes. The actors discuss Mehta's directing style, mastering the period mannerisms, and their characters. "The Story Behind the Making of Water" (4 min) is about the controversy and the ill-fated first attempt to film "Water". There is a good, continuous audio commentary by Deepa Mehta in which discusses the sets, actors, character development, cinematography and lighting, the film's score, and provides additional information about Indian culture. 
 Moore and Bruder have, in my view, provided an excellent philosophical resource. The 3rd and 4th editions have proved invaluable in my work, both as a student and an instructor. I have no doubt that the 5th edition equals its predecessors and would readily adopt it as the required text in any Introductory Philosophy course 
 Turning Angel is a legal thriller worth reading.  Set in Natchez, Mississippi, it has some of the same characters as one of the author's earlier books, 'The Quiet Game'.  It is about a standout high school student, Kate Townsend, who is found raped and murdered.  During the investigation of the case, a prominent local doctor, Drew Elliot, becomes a suspect due to his rumored sexual involvement with the victim.  Attorney turned novelist Penn Cage, who is one of the repeat characters, is involved as the suspect has been his best friend since childhood.  Elliot wants Cage to represent him.  The story is quite well done and certainly holds one's attention.  It contains deceit, adultery, violent drug gangs, teenage thugs, and more.  There is also a great deal of exploration of the dark side of the modern day high school subculture.    The story itself is quite riveting and well done.  I am a bit disappointed with the author in this book as he seems to try to justify or at least turn a blind eye toward relationships between middle aged men and teenage girls.  In spite of that, it is a good novel and will not bore readers 
 This is an exceptional book for anyone looking to get the initial know-how on how to convert a gas vehicle to an electric vehicle (EV). It's full of resources to help you find the parts you are looking for to do your EV project, and it actually does a conversion in the last chapter. There are a couple things you don't hear much about in the book, such as the insidious re-wiring of the dash board, and it sort of glazes over a couple minor issues, but all in all, it's the best resource I've found yet for converting to an EV. The history buffs will enjoy the detailed history of the EV, and if you work for NASA, there are a ton of great physics problems (15, I think) to keep your brain moving. Don't let the math scare you, I discovered that "eyeballing" it works most of the time, and if it didn't work, I would just pull out the old calculator and scratch pad. My advice would be that even if you aren't planning on "Building your own EV", you should buy this book. It's full of great stuff 
 This is a very good album of LAURA PAUSINI. It was quite hard to get it here in Slovenia... -:)  Songs Amores Extraños and La Soledat are the most beautiful balades that I've ever heard 
 The daily wisdoms of the Dalai Lama have inspired me each morning . The last thing I do before heading out the door is read my wisdom for the day. It has inspired me, made me think before I act and, most important, made me  think about how and why others act. This is the first book by the Dalai  Lama I have owned. I am so inspired by it that I have given it as gifts to  my friends. His Holiness has such insight and is an inspiration to read. I  reccommend this book to everyone, religous or not, as I believe we all need  a positive thought to begin our day 
 I don't know what's scarier after reading this book.  The fact Rich can substantiate everything he's written with fact as it appeared in the news media.  Or the fact so many people beleived what the Bush administration was spinning.  It would seem that many of the people who panned this book didn't read it.  Which is typicall of the far right.  They want so to beleive that the Bushes didn't mislead them.  Even in the face of such damning evidence that they did.  
 This book is definitely a challenge. You may find yourself wondering if it's worth the effort through the first half, but hang in there! This novel pays off big in the last 150 pages with a plot that proves not only intriguing but genuinely thought-provoking as well 
 This book is certainly not a how to book. It is most definately a coffee table book showing off the talents of Mr. Bailey & his design team. They are very good at what they do.  I use this book as my design inspirational bible and have produced some great, one of a kind arrangements for weddings and parties. It is a pity that the author decided against sharing his knowledge. This book could have been a great best seller had he offered up some basic design techniques. Though I love the book, everytime I thumb through it, I ask myself - who was the intended audience? 
 After visiting Zig Ziglar.com and signing up for a free newletter, I entered a contest. What I won was more than just a free book. It was Mr. Ziglar's "Success for Dummies". No matter where you are in life, if your not satisfied - this is the book for you. He doesn't just entertain and lift your spirits and expectations(and he does this thoroughly), he gives you the pattern to fulfill your plan. God Bless Zig Ziglar - I am now living the plan 
 I was very pleased with this book.  Although I must state that it doesn't go into much detail, it is a great resource for when you are "looking something up" or for the novice cryptozoologist.  BUT I think its important (and perplexing) to note that although this is co-authored by Loren Coleman, there is NO MENTION of the MOTHMAN of Point Pleasant, which was the reason I bought the book in the first place!  
 Crying Freeman - A Taste of Revenge (Vol 2)  A Taste of Revenge takes up from where Portrait of a Killer left off. After embracing the new incarnations as Ron Tayan and Fu Ching-Ran, both Freeman and Emu Hino mature into their new function at the helm of the 108 Dragons family.  In this two episode DVD we quickly move away from character development and segue into a new set of villains in The Horn of Africa - a group personally invested in the eradication of the 108 Dragons.  The Horn of Africa send an envoy to the 108 Dragons heavily guarded ship with a valise full of money.  The gang remising in their duty to thoroughly search this impostor suffer the consequences.  The courier quickly eliminates all of the Ten Planets who function as a human shield - making Freeman's life more precious as many have been sacrificed to save him.  This killing spree exposes the vulnerability of 108 Dragons - of which Freeman is bound to develop A Taste for Revenge.  Once again, the question of excess violence rears its ugly head.  There are copious sex scenes as well as the violence that should factor in the viewer's choice to stay with the series.  I personally did not enjoy this DVD as much as the first one - of which there was more character development and plot.   Crying Freeman is unique in its style and cross-cultural representations - yet again. In this volume we see crass representations of Africa as cesspool of violence.  Then again, there is no place in the Crying Freeman series that is not a cesspool of violence. I say enjoy it for the freshness and uniqueness it brings to Anime.  Crying Freeman - Abduction in Chinatown (Vol 3)  Abduction in Chinatown is perhaps the most powerful in terms of stereotypes but not in story and plot.  In the first of the episodes, Abduction in Chinatown Freeman meets Nina.  Nina is a little freak that has fantasized over Freeman from the first moment she saw him. The plot thickens when Freeman levels the rival gang with Nina at the helm.  The second installment in the series, The Russian Connection, brings to presence yet another set of stereotypes - the brutal Russian mob.  The whole series up to this DVD is somewhat characterized by deterioration in terms of storyline but an improvement in animation.  The scenes become more vivid while the characters more cliché...  The most interesting bit of the animation is the loyalty to its manga roots. There are distinctive, clear lines on each character - but the characters themselves remain void - almost tepid.  As I segue from here to the much-anticipated live action feature, I begin to feel a sense of trepidation and excitement - but mostly ambivalence.  Making the jump from Anime to live action can be tricky. What with all the special effects moviemakers have at their disposal, the live action version promises to redeem this series that showed so much promise from the outset.  Miguel Llor 
 I find it funny (truthfully, somewhat sad) when others give this piece anything less than five stars and dismiss it is as "not his best" work.  On his worst day Buk could have typed one sentence better than a lifetime of the sewage spewed by such people.  This collection is definitely a testament to that fact, as others below have astutely recognized.  If you've gotten ANY appreciation for Buk, do not hesitate to add this to your collection.  It has some of the finest moments of Buk that I have ever come across, and that is definitely saying alot as I have read most of his work.  There are moments contained within the corners of these pages, that are nothing less than inspiring.  I certainly will be the first to admit that I cannot find words to desribe it, so I won't even try.  Just rest assured that it is well worth your money to get this collection and do not believe the ramblings of others that this is somehow inferior Buk.  Buk could simply do no wrong when it came to his craft.  Get this and cherish it 
 If you wanted to learn how to screenprint for either a hobby or for a business venture, STOP!! Look no further than this book.  This is the most comprehensive book I have ever read dealing with the business of screenprinting.  Not only does this book give a fantastic overview of how to screenprint, it also contains examples of forms, blueprints for making a 4-color machine, sample store set-ups, how to market...you name it!! It is worth every penny and then some 
 I don't know why people are writing essays on this particular movie, but I thought it was pretty funny and entertaining.  I enjoyed it.  Some parts could've been funnier than they were, but for the most part, the movie did it's job....MADE ME LAUGH!!!! 
 No, this book is not for someone who wants lively light entertainment, and it is not a 'travel' book. What it is is a lovely woven cloth of experience and observation. It's subtle and beautiful. 
 Nice review. However, the competition in the realm of defense/defence economics books is scarce. So don't look around that's it. It provides a balanced and objective description of the economics of defense. It's a bit too old and concetrates on UK. It offers some international comparison, but for that it's better to read some more recent working paper 
 It is a common practice for critics to say that this is not so great a record, as compared to other efforts of Pops and Duke. It takes only one hearing to see that this is nonsense. This record is above and beyond any criticism. It is the only recorded document of two of the founding fathers of Jazz playing together. I does not matter if the supporting musicians are not at their best. This record is simply beautiful. No one but Louis could sing "Azalea" so graciously. And there is some great blowing, too 
 This book is a collection of fond memories, hindsight perspectives and intimate behind-the-scenes tales from the Dodgers' dugout during the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Paul Gutierrez is a great writer and seasoned reporter!  This book is a quick read (even for non-sports fans) and very much detail-oriented (that Gutierrez definitely put time and effort into this book).  I read this book over the course of a week and enjoyed it so much I almost felt compelled to write the author (LOL).  Recommended 
 John Spong puts into language easy to read by clergy and non-clergy many of the ideas hidden in the walls of a few seminaries.  He is clear and direct, and very helpful in looking at the Bible in light of 2 centuries of questions and research.  Important book, I believe, to give us many doubters a way to relax and grow in our fatih 
 A must read for anyone interested in the history of Jamaican political gangs.  Laurie takes you back to the begining to give to a ful understanding of how these gangs began.  From the political wars in Jamaica  to the drug war in the streets of New York 
 This work, the story of fifty years of marriage in three different ambitious Jewish families, is very good, though it is, as pointed out by the other reviewer here, difficult to get into the various characters.  Eisner's a true pioneer, and the story he told is of by and large cold people, so seeing them treated coldly may have been intentional.  What prevents me from saying this work is great is Eisner's over-reliance on narrative and dialogue to propel his tale.  The true strength of Eisner's story-telling abilities here is in his drawing pencil, not his dialogue, so it's something of a shame he didn't rely on it more 
 I love this book.  I have many parenting books and this one is by far my favorite.  The advice on discipline is priceless--no yelling or getting into major debates with your children.  I have already used several of the suggestions with my niece and it has worked like a charm.  Buy this book! 
 Purely for the digital artwork, the book will be a pleasure to some readers. Certainly, the artwork is impressive. But the point of the book is how you can also aspire to creating such output using Illustrator CS2.   The emphasis on the book is on treating the reader as an artist, rather than as a computer programmer. It explains the many powerful techniques available to you. But you can and should treat these purely as a means to instantiating your efforts.  The book shows that Adobe has gone to some lengths to make very complex to implement methods be as simple as possible to use. The text also covers both making digital images for the Web and for hardcopy. Illustrator handles both well 
 A Must for the New Bengal Owner!  I'm not new to owning cats, but I am new to the Bengal breed.  This book is very helpful. It goes into detail about the breed and there are specifics that bengal owners should know that are different than other breeds.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen in this book, would have been color pictures.  I only has black & white drawings...but the information is great 
 Excellent album and Music keeps your feet tapping along with a great vide 
 In this third collection of Alan Moore's important and groundbreaking run on the Swamp Thing series, both character development and sheer gothic American horror become the keys. During this period (original issues #35-42), Swamp Thing learns that he is an elemental spirit in true communion with the plant kingdom. This would become monumentally important to the further development of the character. Moore was tackling both social issues and horror devices at this point, and he was delivering tremendous plotlines in all areas. There are werewolves, vampires, and zombies appearing in the series during this stretch, but this is not cheap slasher fare but strong and innovative literary horror writing. On the social commentary side, the first two installments here, "The Nukeface Papers Parts I and II" tackle chemical and nuclear dumping. Moore dives into women's issues quite believably in "The Curse" (an extreme rarity in comics even today), while "Southern Change" and "Strange Fruit" are very disturbing examinations of slavery and racism in the Deep South. This edition of the Swamp Thing series does not contain any written introductions, but there is a gallery of individual covers featuring the always amazing art of Stephen Bissette and John Totleben. For some reason only four of the eight relevant covers are included, and the withholding of cover art is an overall disappointment in this series of graphic novels. However, that is ultimately a minor concern as the incredible work of Moore, Bissette, Totleben, and their other important colleagues has the power to blow the minds of readers of any kind of fiction 
 I will begin by stating that the negative reviews revolving around the laborious nature of the book are correct but inevitable.Branch has bitten off a great deal in this book.  Keep in mind that his series is not a biography of King nor a book about the civil rights movement - it is a detailed survey of American history from 1954 to 1968 through the lense of the civil rights movement. Branch argues that this is the core narrative of that period of time. Because of this, Branch must cover a great deal of ground - from the inner conflicts within the civil rights movement to the inner workings of the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses to Vietnam to the Beatles landing in New York.  This creates a very long book that can be hard to follow but is well worth it. In addition, one needs to know that, despite this being 1963-1965, the first third of the book covers a period (Birmingham and the Kennedy assasination) that he had already covered, if somewhat differently, in the first book. This is a neccessary evil for the nature of his narrative.   As laborious as it seems, I feel Branch is more than up to the task. I really cannot fathom how much research he has had to do.   The years that branch covers in Pillar of Fire are the mountain top years of the King-lead civil rights movement.  After the assasination of JFK they get a president in the white house who actually appears to agree with them on most issues and is willing (most of the time, with a little prodding) to do something about it.  The result of this is the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts - the two pillars of american civil rights law. This does not come without a struggle, however.   The movement is beset by forces from within and without that threaten to undo their good work - including King's own personal demons. It also witnesses the rise of Malcom X - who raises serious, legitimate questions about the purpose, ethics and viability of nonviolent social action.   The book climaxes (sort of) with King in Oslo, Norway recieveing the Nobel Peace Prize. But King is not destined to stay on that mountain top. The relationships within the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Comittee (SNCC) - the group that continually challenged King to do more - began to devolve. King is confronted by the (correct)realization Hoover's FBI is using survelance to cover every word he says.  King also begins, very early, to take a position against the Vietnam War, leading him into confrontation with LBJ - his previous ally in the white house.   The mountain top experiences of 1963-1965 were wonderful but, for King, as he said, the valley calls. 
 I think Robert is the real stylist to be able to make common things expose into the world. When I read this book, I was encouraged to explain hidden meanings of urban life. Excellent analasis on urban history. 
 A different Lew Archer here than THE BLUE HAMMER Lew Archer. The tone is in TDP is more gritty and hardboiled. Lew is less the romantic toward the ladies he meets. I like Macdonalds' writing in TDP. A less polished and more direct style has its appeal. There's less psychological development of the characters, more emphasis on plot.   
 I really enjoyed Nate and Hayes from the first time I saw it. I got this movie on laser disc back in the early 80's when I was stationed in Pearl Harbor in the Navy. There was a Bar called "Bully Hayes Place" we used to go to. I made sure I had a copy of the movie so I could always show my friends. If you like Action and Adventure this is a can't miss. I have watched it with my friends over and over and was thrilled to be able to get it on DVD 
 OK, well maybe read "Moby Dick" too, but if you're going to read just one book by Melville, I suggest this one.  Disregarded in Melville's lifetime, this book could have been written today...except that it  exemplifies the cultural moment that produced it.  Lyrical, magnificent,  prescient, and wonderfully confusing, I'm on a personal mission to  introduce this novel to as many people as possible 
 My son bought this movie as a gift for one of his best friends.  She watched it at her party and everyone loved it.  My son told me that next time I buy a movie for our collection, I should buy this one and that I definitely have to see it.  
 I have known of this album for many years, but only purchased it recently. It immediately became a desert island classic for me.  It, along with Sintra Sings for Only the Lonely, definitively prove that Sinatra was the real deal--he was more than the swagger and the Rat Pack.  He was the greatest pop singer of the 20th century.  He was a true musician who understood the songs he was singing.  This is a music-have CD 
 This books makes you appreciate all of the advantages that one is afforded by simply being born into an advanced economy.  Yunus does an great job of explaining his rational for how he developed his bank and what has made it successful.  He truly does deserve his Nobel Prize as I am sure his banking model will have an ever-widening affect on the lives of millions for generations to come. 
 I am not a photographer, but I enjoy taking good pictures. I never had a digital SLR before; the camera I had before the D50 was a Nikon Coolpix (a compact one). I thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro. I realized that it was even better than what I expected (maybe because I was coming from a Nikon Coolpix). The colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good. The D50 is among the cheapest digital SLR's, and, at the same time, it is a very serious product. I don't think the D50 is much inferior to the Canon Rebel, even if the Canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution. I used both the D50 (which I own) and the Rebel (at my school) and I think the D50 feels much more like a "pro camera" when you hold it in your hands, while the Rebel feels more like a toy. The lenses provided in the package are good, but are basic. According to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80, but I think I should have bought the 55-200 as well: 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take. Also the 18-135 that Nikon sells with the D80 looks good to me, but they don't make a kit with those lenses for the D50.  The last thing that really amazes me is the .NEF format (Nikon's RAW format). It is impressive how quickly you can improve a .NEF picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse.  If you want a good camera, and you don't want to spend too much money for it I think this is the best choice 
 There are some authors whose books I feel compelled to read: Saul Bellow, Garcia-Marquez, Isabelle Allende are examples- the writing is so immediate and beautiful. To this group I am adding Moses Isegawa. His story is fascinating- I take it that this is autobiographical. He understands life in terms of power struggles- first his Edenic existence with his grandparents, particularly his midwife grandma, whom he assisted; then his life with troubled and tyrannical parents, school bullies, an oppressive stint at Catholic boarding school, later adventures in business, avoiding trouble during the Amin years, subsequent emigration to Europe. At every turn there is someone trying to thwart him and whom he outsmarts with stealth and patience. There are a host of eccentric characters and natural disasters to be coped with. The customs of Uganda are so different from what we Americans are used to, yet the author conveys how the people are so like us in feelings and motivation. He might be called cynical, but it's just reality that he describes - and he is likeable. The writing is superb. The idiom seems American- do they really talk like us over there? How does he do that? I enjoyed this book as much as Bellows' whose midwestern Jewish background I share 
 I've been tutoring SAT students in Manhattan, Connecticut, and New Jersey for ten years now, and I've never seen any other resource or material like this book/CD. It's really a whole new way to approach studying vocab - one of the most dreaded and most necessary parts of preparing for the test - that I think students will really go for. The songs are terrific! I just got my hands on this book (after a friend recommended it) and can't wait to use it with my students this fall. 
 With Robert Fagles's version of 'The Aeneid' just released, I thought that would be the version I would be reading. I tried Robert Fitzgerald's version some years ago, but I gave up after the 5th or 6th "book". After reading the numerous glowing reviews for Allen Mandelbaum's translation, I thought I would give it a shot.... plus it cost a lot less than Fagles's! I was not disappointed.  Mr. Mandelbaum's take on Virgil's epic is eminently accessible, very easy to understand (but not dumbed down at all). The glossary at the end is a huge help in identifying characters and places (as many of them go by more than one name).  This is a thrilling tale full of adventure, romance, war, friendship and loyalty. If you buy only one version, this is the one to get. 
 I have recently purchased this wine making book. It contains many receipies for many diferent types and styles of wines. I have found it to be very helpful in my efforts to making good sound wines 
 From the beginning to the end was excellent. The music played throughout the movie wasnt scary but funny in a scary twisted way. I think it is a great movi 
 This is the story from the creation to the present day and is a not only a fascinating film history in itself, but an perceptive study of how what should have been just another action film became the longest running engagement in cinema history.  Definitely to be savored, preferably with a vodka martini, shaken-not stirred. 
 Reid's Suffer in Silence is riveting from cover to cover. It's raw and intense, and rings of authenticity. It will give pause to anyone contemplating the agony of BUDS program, but incite and inspire those as focused and masochistic (self-declared by the author) as Reid. The details of the story are exhaustive, and the rhythm of the book follows the undulations of the long, sleepless nights of the Hell Week experience, leaving the reader spent by the end of the book and craving for deeply needed sleep (or just a nice afternoon nap, as in my case-- of course, after I finished the book!). Though portraying experiences that push the limits of human endurance, and offering a glimpse into a (sometimes dark) mindset and world far from most of our comprehensions, Suffer in Silence succeeds in also being fun and engaging... a great read. 
 This book say it all in a most readable way. It could be handed to a recent head injured person who is still confused as a tool to help understand what is happening to them. It should be compulsory reading for  every family member and care giver of the head injured . My family and  friends have all read it and I must say it transformed their attitude and  understanding as to what I was dealing with. It is written in simple but  concise language you do not have to have a degree to understand. It uses  real life examples which enables one to be able to associate with  individual aspects of what is being relayed. Not only does it formulate the  problems but gives concise direction as to available solutions and  strategies that can be adopted by all parties. I know that this book has  been a most valuable tool in my development after my head injury and feel  it has great merit. A viable gift to anyone with a head injury or has a  head injury in the family 
 As someone born and raised a Swedenborgian, this new edition of Heaven and Hell represents a signficant step forward.  Readers should dive into the meat of what the book itself says, not the introduction.  There are incredible gems of spiritual wisdom in its pages 
 This is so essential probably one of the last masterpieces in hip hop at the time when this was released hip hop was still in what many consider to be the golden era of hip hop, hip hop was young hip hop was fresh and hip hop was not on the radio now days it's almost impossible to go a day without hearing hip hop on the radio on the tv on a billboard were ever hip hop has lost it's flava i feel that hip hop started declining when cats like Puffy realised that it was marketable i remember seeing him doing big Hollywood videos and talking about bling this bling that big rims and hoes (you know the rest) than every rapper jumped on it now days rappers do whatever just to get paid to get an extra buck and nobodys is saying anything intelligent any more no one actually takes time to sit down and right an intelligent rhyme but if they did would these kids even listen? of coarse there is always gonna be that one dude out there pushin' it but hip hop is definatley on a life line and i feel this is the last real masterpiece i heard in hip hop incredible jazzy beats intelligent lyrics CLASSIC now if only he stopped working with Kanye than he might be able to drop another classic.  p.s I also reccomend LIKE CHOCOLATE FOR WATE 
 Denis Johnson does here what so many others have tried to write and failed: a coming-of-age novel for adults.  And it's good--real good.  He doesn't know how to close it, and it's essentially a short story--but then again, so is one's life

 A great anthology of sermons, prayers, stories, personal testimonies to delve in and return to 
 I teach preschool and have both preschool and Kindergarten boys.  This book is so fun to read aloud in circle time or at home before bed.  All the kids love to sing-a-long to Mortimer's "Clang,clang, rattle bing bang" song.  I recommend it highly! 
 This is the gem of the Wayne/Ford Calvary trilogy, and I am delighted it's finally coming to DVD.  But a question: Can anyone heal me of the following misjudgment?  Try as I may, I cannot shake off my estimation of Fort Apache as a more complete and substantially higher overall cinematic accomplishment in comparison with The Searchers.   Partly it may consist in the fact that The Searchers is a great movie to watch -- and watch again -- but Fort Apache somehow succeeds as a more nearly perfect, complete and wholly rounded experience. The Searchers shines due to its externals, but Apache proceeds and then later culminates in a richer, deeper and more satisfying way, and the whole movie experience resonates with you in a way that The Searchers does not quite achieve 
 Another fabulous album from the standards trio. The recordings were made in 2001 and clearly Jarrett is fully recovered from his illness of the late 90's as the inspiration level remains incredibly high throughout.   The 'standards' here are all very good, but the main reason to buy this recording is the great title track. This runs to nearly 20 minutes and runs through a number of styles, the dominant one being a long bluesy improvisation 6 minutes into the track.   Its difficult to rank this in the huge number of albums that the standards trio have produced over the years, but if you can only buy one, then this is as good as anything.  
 If you are looking to recap and review biology, this is a great book. I graduated with a degree in biology and wish I would have had this book to simplify and guide me through college. For simple explanations that are easy to understand, especially if you forget certain concepts, you should purcahse this book. This is a great book 
 This is the best book I have ever read on stock investing.  I have probably read 25 books.  It is the best because it is applicable.  Many books will tell you to buy what you know, to buy companies with sustainable competitive advantages, to buy companies with better Management etc.  However, it is impossible for the average person to find this out, unless they spend hours reading the 10k's.  This book gives you techniques that the average person can use.  
 I read this book after reading a superb review by Alan Wolfe in The New Republic. He said that it was the most important book on education in decades, and now that I have read it, I agree. I am a graduate of a major teacher training institution, but I never understood the history of education--and where so many anti-intellectual ideas originated--until I read this book. For the first time, I understand that intelligence testing was deeply anti-intellectual, and that progressivism targeted the academic curriculum for extinction. The greatest value of this superbly written book is that it makes this complicated history comprehensible to the reader without oversimplifications. If every school board member, teacher, and parent in America would read LEFT BACK, we would have a far better school system in the past than the one we have now 
 I found that virtually EVERY paragraph in this book has something of tremendous value to say to those who seek realistic escape from the frantic, artificial, and so often mindless "fast-forward video" pace of modern life - whether it be a thought-provoking observation, a relevant quote, an incisive suggestion or a mind-expanding analysis of a particular topic - the author's words realistically speak to, and gently correct, the life-destroying freneticness so many of us habitually fall into.  But please, don't just quickly scan through this wonderful volume - slowly consider, absorb and mentally savor it's insights a little at a time, like you would leisurely enjoy a delicious meal.  I think you'll find it well worth your time.  Carl Honore has truly written a gem here - one of the best books I've read in years. 
 If you thought this book was intended to be a serious book on martial arts, you were both right and wrong.  When I first read the book as a teenaged martial artist in the early `60's, I was blown away by it and believed every word.  It's underlying philosophy more than anything else about it influenced my early martial arts development.  Then in about 1976-77, a Tai Chi friend of mine by the name of John Panter told me he thought that "John F. Gilbey" was probably a pen name for Robert W. Smith, Don Draeger, and some of the crowd Smith and Draeger hung out with in Asia.  He guessed this  based on the writing style and content that was similar to their other writings.    Years later, Robert Smith came out and explained exactly how he and a group of friends (all senior martial artists including Draeger who were Westerners trained in Japan and China) got the idea of writing a spoof about the martial arts. They made up the name, "John F. Gilbey," and invented a personal history for the name that combined their actual martial arts credentials. The book turned out to be a great success, but not as they had planned. Unfortunately for them, so many people believed that "John F. Gilbey" was a real person and the book a completely true book, that it took on a life of it's own and only added to the wild tales about martial arts that became popularized in the West. This happened because Smith was so skilled at interweaving fact with fiction that he unwittingly produced a satire that many found believable as complete "fact." Robert Smith later wrote an even more wild sequel to the book thinking that would finally enlighten people, but once again, he was wrong. Finally, he just came out in the martial arts magazine, "Journal Of Asian Martial Arts," and told the true story. He later repeated it in his book, "Martial Musings."   Here's a bit of what Robert Smith said: "Gilbey was a joke, an exaggeration, a fantasy.  He had money, time, and amazing skill in everything.  We were sure that readers would be smart enough to realize this.  We were wrong....'Secret Fighting Arts of the World' contained some truth, plus many whoppers."  If you want a longer explanation of what was truth and what was whoppers, I highly recommend reading "Martial Musings," which I think is Smith's best work.    But my tale of this book doesn't end there.  I recently learned that back in the `70's my old friend, John Panter, actually used a technique from the book in a real situation!  When I quizzed him on it, here's what Panter said: "It was the Macedonian Buttock! I was coming home from work on the Subway in Toronto. It was my last day on that job and I was carrying my work clothes in a bag along with my lunch kit and some other stuff, all under my arms. I had to get off at the Bay St. Station to see if something I had lost was at the Lost and Found there. Of course, since construction jobs let out at 4:30, I hit Bay Street just in time for all the office workers who get out at 5:00 to be heading home. Well, when I had to get out, I was faced with a wall of people trying to get in, and I realized that if I got jostled at all, I would lose all my stuff and it would get trampled before I could pick it up. Now the etiquette is supposed to be that people getting off have right of way, but that wasn't working this time, and there was this great big meat head coming straight toward me. I quickly turned sideways to him, and rotated my shoulders further so that the things I had under my arm weren't in line with my hips, and when he ran into me I let him have the buttock thrust. I purposefully waited `til he was against me so that it was a push, not an impact. I wanted to move him, not hurt him. In any event, he went flying backward, and fell spread-eagled on top of two or three rows of other people that were behind him. I can still remember the look of total astonishment on his face as I stepped past him."  One final note here.  John Panter went on to become the head of the Taoist Tai Chi Society's entire Atlantic Region in Canada.  I remain just another average Black Belt level martial artist...    In conclusion, this book is a fun read for entertainment, cut-to-the-core insight, and deadpan satire.  Smith has a sense of amused perspective on oneself, history, and the fighting arts. The writing style is great, and I highly recommend it. Just remember that the author intended this as a spoof!   
 This novel is an excellent book, focusing mostly on Worf, Troi & Riker.  When an emotion-casting species called the Sli come on board the Enterprise, the crew is affected by their emotional projections.  The crew must save the planet Lessenar from ecological collapse, and try to find a saboteur even though the Sli are affecting their emotions.  The writing style is excellent and flowing, and the characterization is great.  We get to see more of Worf's son Alexander, Guinan, Ro Laren, and the quarter-Romulan crewman Simon Tarses (from the episode "The Drumhead").  The storyline is unique and has many interesting twists, and we get to see events from many of the senior crew's points of view.  A funny thing was how the Sli made everybody act slightly odd.  Riker was acting all insecure, Beverly was a ditz, and Geordi was in a VERY foul mood.  The other senior officers also had goofy emotional problems.  The only bad thing I found was that the story on the planet Lessenar did not have much to do with anything else in the book.  It seemed to be there just so there would be an extra difficulty in the plot.  But Sins of Commission is really enjoyable read.  Recommended 
 This is one of a handful of books I've read over the years that has fundamentally changed my view of the world. Don't be scared by the subject matter: this isn't a grisly book recounting the stories of violent murderers. It's as much an investigation into the question "What is conscience?" as it is about the presence of truly conscience-less people in the world. Just the first chapter alone is worth the price of the book, wherein Stout writes about what it's like TO HAVE a conscience. 
 So far so good - new house and no spraying problems for a month 
 I picked this book up not knowing what to expect.  I was slightly familiar with Belzer's stand-up, but hadn't read anything he had written. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.    I have always been slightly interested in conspiracy theories, but with my interest came a bit of embarrassment. Belzer's humor effectively dissolved my embarrassment.  If I started feeling a little ridiculous when I found myself seriously considering an off the wall idea, Belzer's wit would put me at ease.  The humor made it easy to tell yourself, "I'm not crazy, Belzer is."  I can't say that Belzer was able to convince me of anything, but he certainly managed to pique my curiosity.  Should I decide to learn more about the theories Belzer presents, I can simply turn to the helpful bibliography of conspiracy books and resources that Belzer recommends.  The bottom line - this book is a great blend of conspiracy and humor and I think it could be enjoyed by someone looking for either 
 This CD is a must have for all babys! I have three children and all of them go to sleep by this CD.  It makes a great baby gift along with a CD player for the nursery. I just bought it for my brothers first baby girl. The songs are so soft and just the right length 
  The house of the scorpion was a very exciting book. As the main character, Matt, goes through the adventure in the book, the house of the scorpion makes you want to read more, and more, and more... I think this book was a wonderful book, and I highly recommend this book to those that are hungry for good books, best of the best.   P.S.- this book was RRRRRRREEEEEEAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYY exciting 
 I just finished reading the book and upon first reading the reviews in a Masonic publication I knew I HAD to have it sight unseen and unread, because #1, it's a coffeetable size book so I knew it would be a 'keeper' to my book collection.  And I'm SO glad I bought it (also send a copy to another Masonic brother) as it is a great book!  This book will probably go down as THE premier book of generalized Masonic history in America as it is easy to read, filled with information and the history of Freemasonry in the United States. It gives an excellent, truthful and basic story of how Masonry has evolved in America and certainly was a refresher course for myself and it can certainly inform a lot of Masons who probably don't know about their own organization and hopefully will spark interest in good men that will seek membership in our ancient and honorable craft.  It beats all the other books out there that make Freemasonry look strange, dark and secretive.  This book is there to make American Masonry shine and sparkle like it should as Masonry has really played a very significant role in the history of this great country and deserves its continuation for many generations 
 This was a very good book.  It did tend to drag a bit in spots but as a whole it was very good and the guilty party was a big surprise.  The next Cree Black adventure is hopefully just as good.  I am looking forward to reading it.  Love the spookers.  
 Piper's concern is to remind us that this grace in which we stand in relation to God, is a condition of joy and delight rather than grudging discipline.  As the herald of Christian hedonism he prophetically calls Christians away from the drabness of explicit or implicit practical legalism.  Too many Evangelicals consider discipleship as a general, stoical acceptance of toilsome religious duties and an unhappy scepticism of anything that gives pleasure.  Paraphrasing H. L. Mencken, Piper is fighting against the "suspicion that someone, somewhere is enjoying themselves"  as the prevailing character of Christian life.  Piper eloquently points us away from ourselves and toward God's Person as the sine qua non for true human living.    In this book he undertakes to help us avoid a very real pitfall that causes many Christians to stumble.  He seeks to remind us that it is a very subtle form of self-worship which understands our relation to God as being one where God's ultimate purpose is to make us happy and complete.  Too often Christians are so caught up with the idea that "God has a wonderful plan for our life.." that we can get to thinking that God's whole reason for Being is so that WE can be happy.   Piper does a good job in this book of showing us that our lives and indeed all of creation, is not about US, it is about HIM!  God's Delight is what is of first importance.  Our happiness is a by-product of that Delight when God enables and motivates us to enter into His joy.  It is a very important point and one that is difficult for a consumer oriented generation of Christians to appropriate for themselves or teach others.  I was struck by the ease with which Piper strengthens his writing by taking on the questions that  can distract us from finding our delight in God's Person and thereby entering into His Joy.  Specifically, in this book, I found his handling of the question of God's electing grace to be wonderfully concise yet remarkably thorough.  It is not easy to connect the dots between God's sovereignty and His delight in that sovereignty and our joy in being the objects of that sovereignty, yet Piper does as good a job as I have ever seen.  For those of us who fell in love with the doctrine years ago, it will not add much in the way of new insights, but  he provides us a very accessible manner of communicating it to others, and that alone makes this book worth reading.  I will admit that in this book, as in  Desiring God before it, I could never escape the feeling that he is too anthropomorphic in his characterizations of God.  Though he often affirms God's transcendent nature, yet his practical focus tends to keep "bringing God down to our level" rather than lifting us up to His.   Piper's central purpose in this book is to tell us about God's delight : how He delights in Himself as the Triune God, how He delights in all the things He does, etc.  Piper wants to point us toward God's pleasure as a real and controlling principle for all that we are to understand about Him.  This is right and good.  It is also true that the Scriptures continually remind us of God's pleasure in doing things, and His contentment in His work, and His joy in various people especially His Son.  The problem comes in when Piper implicitly presents God's pleasure as being  essentially like our pleasure.  He does not adequately convey to us that the Scriptural discussion of God's pleasure, joy and delight, reflects God's condescension to us.  It gives us a way to think about God in terms of something that we know and can experience.  It is true that man being created in the image of God is able to draw some analogs between those things he finds in himself and their equivalent aspect in God's character.  But there are decided limits that must be observed.  Man cannot reconcile his own pleasure with his own displeasure.  Man cannot be simultaneously content and agitated with anger.  Man cannot experience the sense of well-being as he is engaged in the outflow of passions.  All this is to say that man is sequential and finite.  God is neither.  God's delight can never be opposed to His "unhappiness" about sin.  God's pleasure is never distinct from His wrath.  God does not move from one mood to another.  We can think of Him in terms that we recognize and seek to worship Him for the knowledge of Himself that He communicates to us in those terms, but we must stop well short of identifying God or His attributes with those things.  God is incomprehensible to us in His Being.  His delight is ultimately incomprehensible also.  He is God and we are not.  The Creator who is outside of all creation can never be understood in His essence through the use of terms which are limited by their correspondence to creation.  This does not pose a barrier to anything that Piper desires to do.  God intends for us to think of Him in terms of being angry at sin and wrathful toward those who commit it.  Alternately, when WE think of Him looking down from heaven on the baptism of His Son, it is right and proper that we should think of His Heart overflowing with pride and joy at the event, even as we parents have that experience when we bring our children to be baptized.  It is absolutely proper for us to think that way.  But we must always keep in mind that God is above and beyond that description.  His Heart did not overflow with joy at that particular moment in any way that would make His level of joy greater than it had been before.  In fact , we can't even consider, from God's point of view, that there was a "before" and an "after" since God is beyond time.  I know that the mind boggles at this point and that practical Christianity cannot constantly abide  in the realm of God's incomprehensibility.  That is why God adopts anthropomorphic terms when He speaks to us and why He allows us to think about Him in those ways.  But, and this is where I think Piper needs to improve His work, we must not go too far down the pathway that these terms open up for us.  We must not ever forget that the wonder of God is most manifested in the way that His incomprehensible fullness was incarnated in a finite body.  The wonder of that cannot be described and it is lost when we identify the finite with that which only infinity can covey.  That being said, I must again affirm that this is a very good book for Christians to use and encourage others to use.  Piper's heart comes through on every page and he has something very important to say 
 I use this between my Dell Dimension 380 Workstation running Win2K and Dell Poweredge 600SC Server running Linux. I've been using it for several weeks without any problems so far. Normally I use the button to switch but I have used the default 'NumLock' as well. I only installed the software on the Windows box but I don't think it was actually necessary. I recommend this product to anyone needing a simple true USB KVM Switch 
 Eon is a great novel with an interesting and dramatic plot that moves the story along and brings up certain important and interesting themes along the way. Eternity has much less of a movng plot, which is why I think many reviewers don't like it as much. Eternity challenges the reader to think about what's right and what's wrong, and how the answers to those questions make them feel. I think this is an important book from its philosophy, but yes, if you are looking for action, keep looking 
 'Junebug' is a great take on culture clash.  Amy Adams delivers a wonderful performance (all the "professional" reviews tout her as the standout), but I was really taken in personally by Embeth Davidtz (the South African beauty is stunning here) and Alessandro Nivola (loved him in 'Laurel Canyon' and he's fantastic again here).  The best single scene in the movie (maybe one of the best scenes ever) revolves around the two of them at a church gathering.  Unbeknown to new bride Davidtz, Nivola's character is known locally as a great singer of hymns.  To her utter shock and bewilderment, he's called upon to sing, and he delivers a passionate one about Jesus while she sits there trying comprehend this part of his personality.  That's really Nivola singing, and it's great stuff.  I wish director Phil Morrison had kept in the longer cut of Davidtz' reaction.  You can find it in the deleted scenes.  Watch it and you'll see the waves of different emotions cascading across her face.  What acting!  It's simple but amazing stuff 
 This is the movie that started what we know as the Wilson Brothers Mafia takeover of comedic films. Me, You and Dupree, My Super EX-Girlfriend, Weddingcrashers and Old School wouldn't have had the Wilson brothers, had they never collaborated with co-writer Wes Anderson. Everyone knows the Wilson brothers from Royal Tennenbaums, but that's not the kind of movie that you can watch over and over again with the jokes getting better. Bottle Rocket was just the beginning of the 25 year plan 
 This is a beautiful fairy tale-esque novel that crosses centuries and temperments while writing a new history of France.  The main character is Cidrolin, a Frenchman in the 20th century who spends his lackadaisical days giving directions to tourists, painting over graffiti on his fence, and dreaming of the Duke d'Auge.  The more charismatic Duke comes galloping into his dreams atop his loquacious well-read horse, starting in the 13th century before running into Cidrolin in our century.  In fact the Duke rams his way through history 175 years at a time.  In the meantime, he argues religion with the clergy, slaughters herds of bourgeois, and bludgeons anyone who happens to disagree with him.  After all, he is a Duke.  It does not get any funnier than this.  Whether you want 3 stooges physical comedy or satire concerning religion and class, it will be provided.  This is a novel in which Don Quixote himself would not be out of place.  The fantastic clashes with the mundane, but always to the readers utmost delight.  Never before has so much essence of fennel been drunk.  Raymond Queneau has added another delightful novel to the ouvroir of Oulipo.  Blue Flowers fits in perfectly next to Calvino and other members works 
 The handy carrying case and lovely volumes will come in handy for our next Virgin Island adventure...sorry we didn't have them along last time for identification purposes!  They are terrific!  Thanks 
 the book has been of value to me in compiling xmas presents and other similar thing 
 This is absolutely, positively the best divorce book on the market, and I've read them all!  I'm a divorce lawyer from Lexington, KY and thought I'd write a book on divorce that would help clients with both the emotional and the legal process....and then I found Your Divorce Advisor.  There's no more thorough treatment of the subject anywhere else.  I actually bought a case of these books to give to clients.  I can't recommend it more highly 
 My almost 3 year old has this set and loves it.  I love the fact that I can turn him loose with it without worrying about him getting magic markers all over everything.  And he loves it because he is able to color with magic markers without me hovering over him 
 Let me start by advising that this is a dry book to read, so it is not for the average reader of narrative history. But its meticulous scholarship makes it an indispensable book about affairs in the Middle East.   People sometimes use the phrase "meticulous scholarship" to send up a warning flag that you had better not argue with what follows. But that is not so here. This book represents genuine scholarship, serving neither the purpose of public relations for Israel nor an attack upon it.    After offering some background on the origins of Zionism, Mr. Shlaim's theme is a review of the first half-century of Israeli policy. The title, an expression coined by an early Zionist, aptly sums up the thrust of that policy.   The author goes where scholarship leads, and he does not flinch from including less-than-heroic episodes that many contemporary books and news sources ignore.   Of course, in some matters of extreme sensitivity, there are still no adequate official documents available to scholars. In such cases, Mr. Schlaim tells us what he knows and goes no farther, leaving us with full confidence in his integrity.  I do not see how anyone can consider him- or herself well-informed on the Middle East without having read this book. It truly is that important. 
 The series features Israeli spy/art restorer Gabriel Allon and his mentor the legendary master spy Ari Shamron. The story continues at full pace as the Palestinian terrorist/archeologist Khaled al-Khalifa is hunted down and eliminated. There are several interesting female characters along the way. The pages keep turning almost on their own. Really an excellent read 
 This book is very helpful for learning about the NT church and it's leaders.It is a "chronological-sociological-historical synopsis of the entire NT." Frank Viola does an excellent job weaving the NT in chronological order.He gives the date,author,and purpose of the letters and books.The notes and Scripture in the End Notes are educational. "Sharpening the Focus" is another very informational tool in this book. On the sociological side,Mr. Viola details the living conditions,health problems(eyesight for one),literacy rate,and average life-span of the citizens in some areas of the Roman Empire(Rome and Galatia for instance).Of all the aspects of this book,the chronology is the most helpful! He defines the two wings of Pharisaism very well.I didn't know that the order of the Pauline letters was determined by their length!Also of interest to me was the origin of the Gospel of Mark. The author does a great job in the definition of the members of the early church.In Antioch they were first called "Christians" by the Greeks. They actually called themselves "the Way".In Palestine they are called "Nazarenes". I listed a few tidbits of info that I found interesting.There is more in this book.Frank Viola did an excellent job with this book and succeeded in making the NT much more easy to understand.This book is very easy to read and beneficial to any collection or library 
 I picked up this book after reading the first of the Shenandoah series.  The first book was sweet and a fun read but this book was terrific.  The story was wonderful!  I loved the characters and was glad to see the characters back from the first book.  The Author understands quilters, their quirks and the beauty of the art that they love.  
 I highly recommend this book. It gives a wide variety of examples of families who have made homeschooling work for their situation. I really liked that it is written in a conversational manner. It's easier to read when it is written like a friend is talking to you rather than like a self-help or instructional book. It has a lot of good ideas and shows how successful homeschooling can be for families 
 This is a great addition for someone already into PT(The greatest band off the mainstream of rock!)One problem- the bonus tracks do not play, that kinda sucks 
 I confess Life and Fate devoured me. Tuesday, I had to stop work, stop my normal schedule, stop answering the telephone, and read it.  And this was not my first, but my second time through its pages.     Life and Fate's main action takes place from the fall of 1942 until the spring of 1943.   It reaches forward in history to the 1950s and reaches back to the Bolshevik revolution itself. it covers every aspect of the Soviet-German war from Stalin and Hitler's offices, to devastated huts inhabited by soldiers and refugees, from the halls of the scientific academies to the dark quarters of the Gulag and the gas chambers of the Nazi death camps.      While there is a lot of action in this book in the smoke and fire of Stalingrad, in the dungeons of Stalin's prisons, and in the death camps of Hitler , the strength of this book is how it covers an important part of history, but also shows the life, loves, yearnings, hearts and minds of real people struggling through the Second World War in the Soviet Union.        Grossman's political target is what he calls the "totalitarian" State. He sees symmetry between Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. Mostly he frames Nazi Germany as being identical to the Stalinist Soviet Union, a depiction that harms the accuracy of his depiction of Germany.  Like many around the world of his generation, Grossman asserts the strength of the human spirit and the struggle for freedom and socialism against these twin horrors. Yet, Grossman appears too much in awe of Stalin and Hitler, and does not realize that their brutality flowed from their weaknesses, not strength.           Even people I know who should know better, see the heroic defense of the Russian Revolution's conquests against Hitler only through the fantasies produced by Stalinist propaganda.  Grossman shows you how this fight was muzzled by Stalin's regime whose abominations did not cease, but grew during the Second World War. Grossman points to the growth of Russian Chauvinism, anti-Semitism, oppression and prejudice against non-Russian nationalities throughout the war.  	 	While he depicts the bravery of the Red Army, Grossman is honest about its real character.  We see its brutality--generals slapping and beating up subordinate officers and soldiers, NKVD officers persecuting generals for military decisions, a commissar plans to have heroic frontline soldiers completely surrounded by the Germans disciplined for living in a spirit of equality between officers and men, behind it all Stalin threatening to and sometimes imprisoning or executing generals.  We see the corruption of the most celebrated of Red Army commanders: with their special privileges in food and drink, their pastime of preying sexually on women attached to their armies, and their concern for their own fame, and their reveling in Stalin's readoption of the regalia and customs of Tsarist militarism. We see the way science is subordinated to the bureaucracy's whims and how integrity and survival are in conflict in Stalinist Russia.  	 For many in the USSR the idea of Soviet victory brought forth dreams of a better day for the peoples of the Soviet Union, but the Stalinist bureaucracy had to break those dreams had to be broken and the dreamers throttled. Grossman gives you the feeling of the dreams for socialist democracy, the end of forced collectivization, and scientific freedom held by his characters and their friends are crushed by the Stalin regimes growing persecution, by its growing identification with the rotten legacy of Tsarist racism, discrimination, and prejudice.          Vasily Grossman was in a position to know. A former engineer who became a writer in the 1930s, he was one of the greatest war correspondents of the Soviet Army. His realistic depictions of the war made him widely popular with the front line troops and allowed his articles and dispatches to carry grimy accurate truth that the censors removed from the work of  other correspondents.      Vasily Grossman was one of the first correspondents to document that Nazi extermination of the Jews. His article "The Hell of Treblinka" in _A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945_, a collection of his war correspondence and diaries, is one of the great works of modern literature.  The passages in Life and Fate on the death camps rise to this level of brilliance, truth, and beauty.          Likewise, Life and Fate has a marvelous chapter modeled after the murder of the tens of thousand of Jews in the town where Grossman was born, the town where his mother lived and died during the war, the chapter centered on a character modeled on the Grossman's mother. Like so much in this book, this chapter could stand on its own as a masterpiece.              But a great novelist like Grossman must do more than teach history.  He must give us characters we care about well enough to struggle its many pages with.           Grossman's characters are full humans, with flaws, with weaknesses, with needs, with enjoyment of little personal desires, with fears, and even crimes they perform to stay themselves. Somehow he can explain not only the hideousness of Stalinism and the terror of war, but the strength of our need for love from family, from colleagues, for romance.            What is missing is any full depiction of the USSR's everyday working class, its peasants, and its rank and file soldiers. All Grossman's major characters are military officers, industrial leaders, party functionaries, scientists, and intellectuals. To be sure, we see the suffering and struggle of ordinary soldiers, workers, and peasants as they cross the lives of his characters, but not through their own lives       Grossman was not allowed to finish this book from him. The NKVD took the book from him. He believed until he died that all the copies of the book had been destroyed. Fortunately, copies survived. One was smuggled out of the USSR and published after his death.           This book suffers from some of the normal problems of a final draft of a great novel has before being edited. In places it is too wordy, we do not know what happens to characters for long sections of the narrative, and Grossman's great digressions distract us from the narrative. For this we can blame the NKVD, not Grossman          Life and Fate is one the great works of Literature. It becomes part of your life beyond the moments its pages are in front of you. We develop such a strong feeling for the lives, hopes, and dreams of his characters that when we finish this book we cannot say "Farewell" to them. We think about their lives and struggles like we do our own.  We need to revisit them by reading this book again.    
 for a trike with pedals ????  i dont see any actuall reviews for this product.... *confused 
 I guess there are many reason to avoid the cost and optimization area, one of them is the darnkess in the searching data involved.But Jelen with his clear explanations and reasonable examples we give us an exelent approach  to this area.. 
 The title of the book is totally accurate. What we find in it is a brief, but also objective and straightforward, history of important issues that shaped the French Revolution and the contemporary political institution building processes. The book distributes important speeches, proposed bills and other documents in different sections, each of which dealing with specific problems (slavery, equality of citizens' rights, the status of the jews etc). It is a very useful book for those who are not scholars in the area but are looking for some reliable source. I highly recommend it 
 There are many good books on flyfishing, but only a very few that make it to great.  This is one of the latter.  For this book, McGuane received the coveted Roderick Haig-Brown Award for Literature from the Federation of Fly Fishers.  The Longest Silence is the finest book on fly fishing that I have read. 	The style of a novelist is brought fully to these pages, offering a wonderful sense of place that all successful novelists must have.  For this died in the wool trout fisherman, even the title essay, which is on permit fishing, was a wonderful read.  I have never seen a permit, have no strong desire to catch one, and probably will never try, but even that essay on a subject so foreign to me, rang as true as any essay can.  McGuane's talent is absolutely marvellous 
 This is one of my husband's favorite movies.  It is also family friendly 
 I exchanged a Hoover WindTunnel II for this and am EXTREMELY impressed with the design, suction, noise levels, and ease of use. I am only a new user and can not give you a long-winded review, but after going over several rooms several times and continuously coming up with more cat-hair and debri, I cannot recommed this vacuum enough. Extremely easy to set up, easy to operate, easy to empty, and has very nicely thought out attatchments.  Pros: - Excellent suction - Attatchments and design make sense and are easy to use - Very easy to empty (some have complained on this note due to a tapering cylinder, but to them I would just say "Empty more often since it is so easy to do") - rubber guards in all the right places and tires keep you from destroying walls, furniture or wood floors   Cons: - Zero, zip, nada, none  Either way, if you think I am nuts, read  some of the other reviews here on this product 
 I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It really worked for me, a chronic back pain sufferer for years. The only 'catch' - you have to do some personal work; it's not a passive approach, unlike what many other practitioners offer. Also, I found it worked well along with Alexander Technique 
 Of all of Nora Roberts' books--and yes, I've read them all--this is my favorite.  It is undoubtedly her funniest.  I first read it six years ago.  I loaned it to a friend who forgot to return it, so I had to buy it again.  I'm on my fourth copy now, I've read it probably ten times, but I keep on loaning it out and reordering and re-reading.    The characters are lovingly developed, and the dialogue quick and genuine.    Dora, our heroine, is a gutsy gal who takes no gruff off anyone, especially her new tenant, ex-cop Jeb Skimmerhorn.  They're a recipe for great romantic sparks and hot sexual tension.    This is truly Nora at her very finest.  I wish she'd write another just like it.  Or almost like it 
 I purchased this audio tape for my daughter for a summer reading assignment for school. It was easy to listen to and follow. We listened to it in the car each time we had to go somewhere. It kept our interest and was a great way to complete the assignment. I wish more book were available on audio 
 This is a movie everyone needs to see.  This movie was blessed by God.  If you are living through difficult times, see this movie.  If you feel that nothing goes right for you, see this movie.  If you doubt your abilities, see this movie.  You cannot watch this movie and not be touched.  Buy this movie.  God loves you 
 I love this book!  It moves us past the out-dated notion of universality of myths (which always, always lost the detail of the specifics of people's narratives) and gives us a real way of approaching cross-cultural myths through a *bottom up* rather than a *top down* approach. Certainly in a time when people around the world are vocally resentful of an attempt to globalize culture, it is important to have an approach to cross-cultural myths that recognize their distinctions as well as their universalities. Doniger does a great job in balancing both. 
 Dr. Norman L. Geisler's "Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics" is a must-buy. It is one of the best defenses of orthodox Christianity available anywhere.   The encyclopedia contains excellent evaluations of famous philosophers and views on religions, theology, ontology, epistemology, axiology, biology, cosmology, and hamartiology, among other areas of philosophy.  Geisler skillfully defends Trinitarian monotheism, the physical resurrection of Jesus, the historicity and reliability of the Old and New Testaments, the possibility and reality of miracles, theistic proofs, the virgin birth, the principle of causality, the divine inspiration of the Bible, Christian exclusivism/particularism, moral absolutism, divine essentialism, creation ex nihilo, the early dates of the Gospels, predictive Biblical prophecy, divine omniscience and omnipotence and other attributes, the justness of Hell, the reality of Satan, and other key Christian doctrines and philosophical concepts.   Geisler thoroughly refutes atheism, polytheism, agnosticism, pantheism, panentheism, deism, Finite Godism, communism, utilitarianism, materialism, monism, existentialism, humanistic optimism, nihilism, secular humanism, fideism, mysticism, illusionism, atomism, Islam, Hinduism, religious pluralism, creation ex deo, the J-E-D-P and Q Gospel theories, Gnosticism, conventionalism, deconstructionism, logical positivism, modalism and other Christological heresies, Molinism, naturalism, neotheism, neopaganism, reincarnation, Sikhism, annihilationism, universalism, and other false doctrines.  The book contains a helpful index of Scripture and Apocrypha, but instead of a word index has only an article index. The book contains many cross-references and is highly readable. It clearly presents Christian arguments and accurately and fairly evaluates anti-Christian arguments. Geisler is careful not to jump to conclusions.   The book mentions several cults as part of articles on other topics. The book doesn't discuss Heaven and Purgatory, and doesn't get too much into the Catholic vs. Protestant issue (mass, papacy, Mary, infant baptism, etc.), except for the article on the Apocrypha. Hopefully these and other topics will be added in future editions. Nevertheless, this book is outstanding and a perfect complement to William Lane Craig and J.P. Moreland's "Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview," as well as a corrective to Craig's theological Molinism. Don't hesitate; buy this book today and you will not be disappointed! 
 This is a very informative book that can tell you pretty much everything you need to know when it comes to electric vehicles.  If you want a good fiction read about electric vehicles, try 'The Wilson Concern', by Will Alan.  I found it very entertaining and informative 
 I thought this was a great book for my 10 year old daughter who loves all the series books. She loves this puzzle book  also 
 I am not sure how I should classify ON WRITING. It is part memoir, part guide or manual, and part autobiography. As a reader, this book entertained me. As a writer, this book empowered me.   In a conversational tone, King gives lessons and encouragement to beginner writers and struggling writers in this book. But he manages to do so while telling his incredible story of hard work, disappointment, success, and his tragic and almost fatal accident. This is a book not only for aspiring writers like myself. It also a book that any King fan must read or anyone that appreciates a good story.   
 Much, much, much better than The Big Sleep.  Much.  Times twenty.  Frankly, I disliked TBS so much that it's taken me several years to pick up Chandler again; and I only did so now because I found a battered old 1960-something reprint for less than a buck at a used book store.  LITL was infinitely better from a narrative standpoint, and holds together much more firmly as a simple mystery than its more famous sibling title.  The Marlowe of this book is less of a whiny nancy-pants than in TBS, and the satellite characters make a whole lot more sense.  Two thumbs up, and all that.  
 As a G.R.R. Martin fan and website regular, I did know before hand that this book was only 1/2 the story, 1/2 the characters.  And yes, some of the newer characters are, in my opinion, less interesting than others.   If you're looking at purchasing this book, you've undoubtedly read the previous three (if not go back immediately and start at the beginning!) and know George's style of telling a story through the individual experiences of the characters - and know that that style is a large part of what makes his books so addicitve.  While some of the chapters weren't as fast paced, and while it is frustrating to not get updates on the characters whose stories will be in the second volume, the overall book and story are still excellent.  For me, it was an addictive page turner.  And I mean, in reality, at least we didn't have to wait for George to finish the whole thing (he's still working on the 2nd volume!)!  I can't wait to read the continuation 
 I like this little book because it's realistic and doesn't try to use scare tactics. It's not put out by radicals and it isn't trying to get us to take on too much, too fast. Those who politicize the ecology bug me to death. As if taking care of this planet that we fleetingly occupy is about whether you're on the right or the left, where you stand on gun control, taxes, what defines marriage, or whether the school board should remove Huck Finn from the high school shelves. Making the earth's environment better is selfish, because we stand to benefit from it. It's a planet we share, folks, and we're not doing all we could to leave it in good shape for those who are here now or will live on it when our time is done.   Let's get this straight once and for all: being environmentally conscious does not mean you're a tree-hugging liberal! What it means is, you like a planet that doesn't make you, your children, your grandma and your pet golden retriever sick. The Soviets were a leftist nation and they destroyed their ecology past the point of no return. On the flip side, the right-wing American President Theodore Roosevelt, as Republican as can be, has as one of his legacies the establishment of the National Parks System. "Saving" the planet is not the exclusive domain of leftists, nor-saying it again here--does it equate you with "tree huggers" if you try to do something that benefits the environment. I personally like clean air, clean water, a place to take a walk in nature without stepping in  a nice glowing barrel of toxic sludge, don't you? I don't care if you're farther right than Sister Attila the Fourth-Grade Nun you can't honestly say you don't want there to be forests for you to go hunting in, or unpolluted rivers left for you to take your grandkids trout fishing in, am I right? And, yes, we ALL can recoil at the well-intended but self-defeating environmental fanatics who alienate the mainstream society of America by being too extreme and dogmatic. This book is not written for those who chain themselves to an endangered species of mollusk and go on hunger strikes to protest a TV show on global warming. This excellent little book is not like that at all. It presents what I think are really worthy ideas for cleaning up around the neighborhood where you live. It sets some nice projects out for kids (and grown ups) to get done and that is surely better than not educating our young people in environmental responsibility.   Okay, let me put it this way: would you rather have a child dear to you outside some weekend picking up litter, planting a tree in the side yard and sorting recyclable materials, or would you rather have that child sitting in front of the TV with a PS2, becoming another statistic in the epidemic of pre-teen obesity? This book is a small step in the right direction, and if it does nothing more than makes someone, whatever the age, think about the connection between personal behavior and the state of the earth's environment, then it's a nice investment of time and money 
 Loaded with meaty content and practical strategies that are bound to improve any executive's negotiating skills in a variety of situations.  The examples are relevant and are easy to understand. I wished I would've read it ten years ago. I would've made fewer mistakes and increased the number of successful outcomes I've negotiated for our business. If you're looking for a practical guide with a lot of take-away value, this book delivers the goods 
 Even though Gordon Ramsay is not exactly likeable when he's tormenting people on "Hell's Kitchen," this book is really great! Although I see what some of the other reveiwers are saying about the ingredients, the truth is he really only calls for hard-to-find British ingredients in a handful of recipes, and it's always easy to substitute - i.e. red snapper for mullet. What's great about these recipes is that they look really impressive, but don't require much work - perfect for impressing dinner guests! Try the Hot Chocolate Fondant (little molten chocolate cakes) - it's amazing with vanilla ice cream on the side! 
 This book is truly a classic on the biology and anthropology of exercise.  I first stumbled upon it in the bookstore when I was just looking for some more books on running.  I wasn't looking for anything in particular and I picked up "Why We Run" off the shelf to give it a chance.  It was just what I was looking for.  The exploration of human anthropology and the scientific explanations of why we run were in exact alignment with my beliefs.  Heinrich's basic assertion is that we run because we're supposed to run.  Our systems are made to use fatty acids and glycerol as fuels for long distance, nomadic type activities, not quick glucose intensive activity.  This clearly sheds light on the heart rate formula for weight loss and what is particularly best for any specific person.  If Heinrich's points are correct, then the conclusion would be a lower heart rate is most effective for weight loss and the preferred zone for any type of exercise.  Any exercise in the higher heart rate zones could be classified as survival training--or expending energy that is meant for fight or flight type activities, like running away from tigers or the like.  This is clearly not anything we have to do in our modern times.  Heinrich goes to great lengths to explore his arguments.  He takes the biology of the other animals and compares them to ours in a very "easy-to-read," unscientific way--something that is relieving for anyone who's spent hours with their nose buried in anatomy books.  The book is anecdotal, because Heinrich bookends the story with his own 100K run. This makes the book entertaining as well and not just a dry scientific read.  It's also great biological justification (translated: "excuse") to tell a spouse who thinks you spend too much time training for the next big race!  Perfect for runners and walkers who want to understand their body and what is best for optimal health!  Kevin Gianni, NCSF-CPT Author, Personal Traine 
 This was an extremely well-written and well-executed book from a technical standpoint.  The writing was smooth and concise, with excellent flow, and the story unfolds in a way that seems almost effortless.  Wolff adopts a remarkably objective tone in examining his own life, a tone which avoids making a melodrama out of his unfortunate childhood, while also creating a certain honesty that (eventually) makes you feel sympathy for a teenager who is not always easy to like.  A side-effect of this detached viewpoint, however, is that at first I felt somewhat removed from what was happening.  But I slowly warmed up to the young Wolff, and by the end I came to cheer for him.  I also recognized many of the feelings he had while growing up, feelings that are hard to admit to and even harder to put into words.  Wolff did a great job of exploring these feelings in an honest, tasteful way that was somehow both subtle and clear.  Overall I would recommend the book highly, and I plan on reading more from this author 
 With 11 years of experience in the field, in my opinion this guide is a top one. Harris has a clear -back to basics- style of writing which come along with some supporting drawings (most people intend to have visual learning capabilities) and fine examples and references.   You'll need certainly some experience in the field and some kind of overview about security topics but with some other additional material available in the field like that of Roberta Bragg and Krutz you'll pretty satisfied with this guide.

 I think this book has had a lot negative things said about it by the media.I also think people hear these things and automaticaly think he is full of it.The truth is this book shows you ways to live healthy and not have to worry about getting sick.If the pharmaceutical industry knows so much about healthy living and kevin trudeau is lying why are so many people in this country sick? I hope more people like kevin trudeau speak out about what is really  going on out there 
 This book is a great way to teach early elementary students a way to make basic (or not so basic) animals.  Does not overwhelm them.  Perfect for those of us without an art degree 
 The Star of Kazan by Eva Ibbotson is a wonderful old-fashioned story. The cover of the edition that I read includes a NY Time blurb "with echoes of Frances Hodgson Burnett." Perhaps it was the power of suggestion, but I could really see these echoes myself (particularly of "The Secret Garden").   The Star of Kazan tells of Annika, an early 20th century foundling discovered as an infant by the housemaid and cook for a family of Viennese professors (three eccentric siblings). Annika is raised like a daughter by the housemaid and cook (Sigrid and Ellie), and gradually comes to be treated as a niece by the three professors. She works as a servant for them (expected to make herself useful), but also receives Christmas gifts, and a special treat every year on her "Found Day." Annika is also much beloved by her friends from the neighborhood, especially the timid bookworm Pauline and the stalwart Stefan, middle child in a large, struggling family of boys. Annika even befriends the elderly aunt of her wealthy neighbors, offering friendship and attention to a very lonely woman. All in all, Annika has a happy, contented life, secure in her place in the world.   However, Annika has one weakness. She fantasizes repeatedly about the mother who gave her up at birth, imagining her mother appearing on the doorstep and loving her. And lo and behold, one day a grand and beautiful lady appears, and says the magic words "my darling, darling daughter--have I really found you at last!" She whisks Annika away to Northern Germany to the family estate, a crumbling moated castle fallen recently on hard times. There Annika meets her spoiled half-brother Hermann, her self-effacing cousin Gudrun, and the half-gypsy stableboy, Zed. And that's where her adventures really begin.   I did unravel the plot in this book long before Annika did, but I'm not sure that 10-year-olds will piece it all together ahead of time. And despite this, I really LOVED this book. The details are perfect, from the warm kitchen in the Professors' house in Vienna to the gaps in the walls where paintings used to lie in the family castle in Germany. The characters are extremely likable, especially Annika's friends, Zed, Stefan, and Pauline, and her fiercely loving foster mother Ellie. Even the quirky professors, who only gradually come to appreciate Annika, display bravery and loyalty when it's needed. My favorite line in the book (page 268) is from Stefan, who tells Zed that "People belong to the people who care for them." This book has adventure and betrayal, Gothic suspense and grand gestures of bravery. But in the end, it's about what makes a family. I highly recommend this book. Happy reading!

 Its great to lay down and listin to this CD at night and just   listin to the ramblings of an old man. Dead Radio City is hard to put into a certain category because it touches them all. Burroughs goes from disturbing revelations to dark comedies to simple life findings. The music backing his voice in this album is pretty good even though it sometimes eclipses his voice at times. Burroughs has a great monotonic voice on this album which creates a great atmosphere and really drills home his jaded,disgruntled, and sarcastic message. All in All every song on here is not a winner but most of the album is pure nirvana 
 The photographs in this book reflect the passion that Steve McCurry has for the people of countries such as India, Afghanistan etc. It also shows his eye for the landscapes of these countries, evoking fervour for the colours of the land. While Steve McCurry's photographs will always move and inspire, the layout of this book is so effective to the display of his works. A large format that gives the images room to breath, and simple facing pages that state the location and date of the image. This is a book that would continue to inspire every time you leaf through the pages 
 While much praise was heaped on the nonsensical Mr Lennon, anonymous Mr Harrison and Mr McCartney who only got good once he left Beatles, those in the know realised Ringo was the only real talent in the Beatles - and he certainly proves his worth here! `Back Off Boogaloo' is better than anything Mr Lennon ever came up with and it also has a fun name. Quality throughout.  Verdict: buy it now! 
 The birth of TG is messy and disturbing to be sure - the sound quality is atrotious and some of the lyrics are truly frightening - but it is nothing if not unignorable and unforgetable. And for all the fuss about the din of noise, the industrial clatter blah blah blah, there are some quite beautiful moments on this cd. "After Cease to Exist" in particular is darkly ambient and almost relaxing. Not the best of the official TG releases, but an absolutely essential purchase 
    A potentially and stunned melodic death metal album. I'm not considder their best work but this album is their most complete. Incredible melodies, excellent musicianship, stunning guitar riffs. An awesome record by this guys!! 
 Teresa of Avila is one of the more remarkable figures in the history of Christianity.  Living in a perilous time, when the Roman Catholic church was suspicious of anything that might develop into Protestant heresies and schisms, she walked a fine line between obedience to the political structure and obedience to God.  It is often the case that mystics and spiritual giants are at odds with church structures of the day (this is rather ecumenical, reaching across Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant lines).    Teresa lived at time shortly after the explusion of the Jews from Spain (which occurred in 1492).  Her own family was a converso family; hence, there were different dimensions to the wariness of the powers in the culture toward her activities.  Being a woman at the time didn't help matters, either, as she defied the stereotypes in several ways, by seeking education and leadership opportunities, all the while being part of the discalced Carmelites, who strive to cultivate humility and poverty.  Teresa's life was not an easy one; she suffered physical ailments and political difficulties.  However, she was also a sought-after advisor, spiritual leader, and fairly prolific author.  Her various writings made her famous in her own day, but the towering achievement that has lasted over time is without doubt 'Interior Castle'.  This text shows a spiritual journey on the inside, developing different walks through aspects of spiritual life and prayer developed in seven stages, or mansions.  The life of prayer is the castle, with seven stages of development.  The first three stages are pieces that humankind can practice with their own efforts; the final four stages are those which are given from God, and God alone - no human effort can reach these places.  The first mansion looks to the striving toward perfection of the human soul.  The second looks to different pieces that give spiritual edification; sermons, readings, prayer practices, conversation, etc.  The third mansion sets forth discipline and penance, striving toward good works while reaching for self-surrender.  These are not easy stages, but are within the realm of human possibility.  The fourth mansion begins the mystical journey in earnest at the behest of God.  Here Teresa uses a metaphor of water and a fountain to explain the soul, and explores graces as spiritual consolations.  Here is the Prayer of Quiet.  The fifth mansion continues the theme of water, looking toward a Prayer of Union, which leads naturally to the sixth mansion, where the soul is prepared for a marriage of sorts, as intimacy with God increases in the soul.  The seventh and final, most interior mansion, which is heaven itself; metaphors here used include two candles joining as one, and the falling rain merging to become one with the river.    These mansions are based on visions; Teresa was compelled to write them down at the order of her ecclesiastical superiors, for she herself thought to keep them to herself.  Her writing was done very late in her life, but even so, she took care to be humble and as non-threatening as possible; modern readers might be a bit taken aback by the self-deprecation of Teresa, and the general stance she seems to take towards women.  This may have been an attempt to make an authoritative text written by a woman more acceptable to the male-dominated hierarchy of the time.  However, not all of Teresa's humility should be dismissed or argued away in this manner.  She is reputed to have said, 'There are more than enough books on prayer already,' in response to being told to write her visions.  This might have been true (then and now), but few reach the power that Teresa's 'Interior Castle' achieve.   
 I have read many book on spirituality, but this one talked to me like no other. David Spangler has captured the complex subject of life through some simple and enlightening viewpoints. The Call is a book for anyone looking  for the present moment or should I say, "becoming aware" of the  present moment 
 This is a great book for a new teacher trying to plan out a school yea 
 I enjoyed the book greatly. Not sure what the May 28 reviewer was thinking 
 Good service. The little box was cheap and ineffective requiring scotch tape to hold it closed. Most are snap-shut design. Other than this, the product is very good 
 Get this version of the CD just for the videos! If you like Paul's iTunes podcasts, you will love this DVD!!! Plus the music rules. All the songs are great 
 Big Time upgrade from Roadie 2. Very happy with features and Remote comes in handy 
 Ranks right up there with Handling the Big Jets, get behind the wheel of an earth grader or dumptruck. Moving great masses of the earth is a singularly human occupation. This book will put you there 
 Some reviewers here have had disparaging remarks about Le Bon's "The Crowd" but I found it very satisfying.  Sure, there are some sweeping generalizations, but don't let that stop you.    I first came upon the title while researching the reasons behind Hitler's triumph over the German people.  During the research, I learned that "The Crowd" had a significant influence on Hitler and he used many of Le Bon's models for his own efforts to persuade.    Considering that "The Crowd" was written in the late 1800's, this book is amazing 
 This book is a must read for every professional soldier and Marine ... or for that matter, anyone interested in ground combat.  If you want a glimpse of what combined arms, ground combat might be like in Kosovo or Korea, read  Combat Team 
 Bought the hairdryer for my wife as a gift. She loved it. It is light weight and has all the necessary functions/setting etc. Good value for money overl 
 This book/2 CD set covers about every beat you might ever wish to know, and plays them on the CD's as well.  An amazing volume of research and work.  I put off buying this for the longest time just because of the price and now I thing it is one of the better bargains in drum books you will ever find 
 I have operated a successful business for twenty years and have purchased a countless number of books on sales and marketing topics and must admit that this is the first time that I have ever been compelled to comment on a book. This is HANDS DOWN THE BEST MARKETING BOOK AVAILABLE, PERIOD! If you are looking for fast, easy, and inexpensive ways to sell more then I highly recommend that you get this book 
 Saw this for the first time and it's a crackerjack. Right from Cagney's opening line in the fox hole--"what do you want me to do, knock?"--the movie blasts along. Nearly every scene with Cagney and Bogart is a gem, with the two quintessential screen tough guys sizing each other up and down and sideways. Bogie's great as the bad apple--gets to speak some brilliant lines which he delivers with that trademark malicious twinkle of his. Cagney is great in a different way--everything about Eddie Bartlett is interesting, from the way he walks and talks to the frequent glimpses you get of something a little more heartfelt. Gladys George is magnificent too as Panama Smith and her mostly unspoken allegiance to Cagney hits an astonishing range of notes. And what about the stunning Paul Kelly as Nick Brown? There's a hefty role filled out to hoodlum perfection. I've seen a bunch of Cagneys now and this is hands-down my favourite. Looks, sounds and feels like the real deal to me--a Goodfellas from 1939. Boy that Raoul Walsh made good movies 
 Jayber Crow may have sat on the back seat of his church, but there is no way the reader of Wendell Berry's book can be so detached from its characters and story.  It is a warm, rich tale of human lives that affects all who venture to its pages.  In addition, Mr. Berry is a master writer.  It appears that the Jaber story is written on two levels, but when I asked Mr. Berry about it, he did not seem to agree.  Perhaps this is the kind of analysis he asks his college students to pursue and is better left in class.   Whatever the case, as a fellow Kentuckian I can vouch for those who say he has a good handle on small town life in that State. He also has the ability to show the lives of the ordinary Port Royal citizens differ little from those of central New York City.  The book is a masterpiece         
 I was hesitant on ordering this book, I've read or bought almost everything I can find relating to bladesmithing or blacksmithing.  I got the book, and read it from front to back, then read it again.  This book not only offers insight on how to make needed equipment, but also explains how to make knives of both stock removal, forging and wire damascus.  I've never read a book on this subject where it felt like the author was talking directly to me, explaining things that I was thinking.  This book is definitely one for the beginner smith 
 Wow, this album takes me back to the fall of '79,  around the same time as MJ was taking over  the world with his scorching solo debut "Off The Wall"!!  Both of these albums got heavy rotation on my turntable  and were house party essentials when I was a 15 yr old  kid spinning the hot joints of the day!  At this time, Prince was still a virtual unknown  to the mainstream, but to a hip urban audience  comprised mostly of blacks, gays, and ultra-hip whites  who really knew what time it was,  this LP served as notice that a "new thang" was  brewin' in Minneapolis that was going to take  the pop world by storm in a few short years!  From the opening track, "I Wanna Be Your Lover",  his first big single (gold) to the rockin'  "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?", which also was  a single and a true fan fave!-- To "Sexy Dancer" which was sure to bring everybody  to the dance floor and into a frenzy! Prince then cools down the mood with  "When We're Dancing Close and Slow",  which is just beautiful with its sparse piano  and acoustic 12-string guitar--one of his many  underrated slow jams of all time!   Then Side 2 opened with the pretty "With You" and into the scorching rockalistic ode to female  bisexuality.."Bambi", which still knocks me for a loop!  I've had the pleasure of seeing him perform this  song live twice down through the years.. once in 1980 during his "Dirty Mind Tour" and  again in 1992 during his "Nude Tour"  while I was overseas!--Awesome!!  Then there's what I call "The Great Triplicate"... "Still Waiting" (another underrated slow classic!),  followed by what is to me, the definitive version  of "I Feel For You"(no disrespect to the  great Chaka Khan!), followed by another  underrated slow jam masterpiece  "It's Gonna Be Lonely", which still sends  me today at 41 the same as it did when  I first heard it at 15!  This album was Prince's first Platinum album,  proving that he (at only 22) was indeed a  hitmaker and one to watch! This album and the next one, "Dirty Mind",  served as a changing of the gaurd from the older  established innovators of that day like  Stevie Wonder, Earth,Wind & Fire and  Parliament / Funkadelic, etc. &  is an essential if your collecting Prince classics!  In fact, you can't go wrong with this kat  between his debut, 1978's "For You" to  1987's "Sign O' The Times"...it just doesn't  get any better! 
 I THINK THIS BOOK WILL BE WONDERFUL BECAUSE ALL THINGS MARTHA IS. AND I LOVED YUOR PAGE TOO. THANKS RUBI 
 No one explains the essential elements of Buddhism bettter Thich Nhat Hanh.

Thich Nhat Hanh writes with clarity and and makes the joy of meditation accessable to everyone with the desire find true happiness.  
 Lured by that damn'd hypnotic Gold Box into snapping up a natty rice cooker, it dawned on me that I didn't actually know what goes with rice, or how to cook it. Back to Amazon's ace 'search' function and voilà! This is the book I needed - and so might you 
 This guide is probably the guide that most people will consider to be one of DoubleJumps worst. Not because it is bad, but because it is, well, different. We are all used to DoubleJump guides being small and crammed to the brink with detail. This one is distributed through Prima so it is a full sized guide and as far as the detail, there isn't nearly as much to include. Almost all other DoubleJump guides are for epic RPGs and Tactical RPGs, games where there is so much stats and details that they will be huge guides. Since Devil Summoner is an action RPG, there simply isn't nearly the same amount of things to include to create a huge guide. What this one does have though, is sufficient.  The guide goes through the basics and the overviews of characters, controls, etc. Pretty much the norm. Then it takes a page out of Nocturne's guide for anyone familiar with it. They show the area maps from each chapter in one section and then the actual walkthrough breakdown in the next one. While some people have issues with this, it can actually be quite nice for those of us who don't want to pass up any items, but also don't want to be lead by hand through the game either.   The walkthrough is pretty much the meat of the guide, nothing too amazing. There is a secrets section, but surprisingly, there really isn't much in the way of hidden things in the game. There are several subquests or side stories covered in the walkthrough, but the secrets section itself only contains three or four major things (some of which are only for second playthrough).   Luckily the wonderful job that DoubleJump has always done on bestiaries, demon fusion and item/magic tables hasn't changed at all. Everything is all laid out clearly and is easy to understand. For some people this may be the most used section, just to find out the enemies weaknesses.  Overall, the guide isn't anything special. For those of us used to DoubleJump's monster "bible" guides, this isn't it. There just simply isn't that much information to put into the guide in comparison to those of other games. What is in the guide though, is done very well and in a clear and concise fashion. It is a good guide, but definately not a necessity for the game. 
 Having run two sizeable advertising agencies, I can attest to the fact that Mr. Fosters' incisive book should become the primer for all creative departments.  He cuts to the chase and tells it like it really is.  Follow his lead and a creative department will hum 
 This is a great collection but why is one of the best, Double Indemnity, missing ???  It is a good collection of a genius who was such a major influence on modern film making.  Both his comedy and dramatic films are in this set. I have to say that his dramas hold up a lot better then the comedy films. The constent theme of stupid women, or the whore with "a heart of gold" now  seems just pathatic and not endearing. 
 Night is Wiesel's personal memoir, which relates his personal story before and during World War II, as he and his father are separated from his mother and sister and interned in a series of concentration camps.   "Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never."   I read Night in high school, and always think of it as being a particularly long book, which it is not. Wiesel manages to pack more than I would think possible into a little over a hundred pages, which relates the story of himself and his family during the Holocaust. It is a beautifully written work that relates a terrible story. I found the story of Wiesel's loss of faith and the relationship he had with his father particularly memorable. If you somehow missed this in high school, pick it up, if you didn't, find it again. It's worth it 
 I found this book to be an excellent study of the promise and failure of revolutions, specifically communist revolutions, to enact  feminst reform.  I use this book when teaching courses, and it is well received.  The points may be basic, but they are well documented and illustrated with a good case study.  Highly recommended 
 my son loves this book, we are going to paint the cover of the book  on his wall 
 it was 13 years ago when i frist saw this movie and i simply loved it to death, then as said in the song "little jackie paper found time for other things and came no more" it was then last week when i herd the song on a local radio station and it all came back to me, i had to see this movie again. memroys came running back from my childhood came running back. this is a great movie for all 
 This book clears up a universe. Galileo had hundreds of problems with the Inquisition,even though he had written his masterpiece based on his observation of the cosmo, in a period that technological devices were rare.  The book is not only a scientific work but also a piece of good literature,  a historical lesson of how to write and how to defend a great idea. The  dialogues remind Plato works and make the book really update 
 THIS RECORD IS FULL OF GOOD MUSIC AND GOOD SINGING AND CAMIL SHOWS THAT HE'S MUCH MORE THAN A BEAUTIFUL FACE. THIS IS A VERY ENJOYABLE RECORD WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF RITHMS. YOU MUST BUY IT!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!! 
 I don't usually run out and buy cds anymore- it's a waste of money if I don't like it.  But this one is a real gem!  I took a chance and am highly satisfied.  This atmospheric music is fantastic and brings beautiful scenes from the movie instantly to mind.  To me, it sounds like a mixture of my favorite soundtracks while at the same time, holding it's own next to them on my cd rack.  A fantastic buy

 There's two things about what B&B Have to do. One, They Have to find there stolen TV And Tow, There going to Washington to score a chick! Don't listen to those stupid unthinkable parents of yours. They Don't what funny is because thy've watching to much of that "Nanny" which just not as funny as the real comedy in this world! Beavis and Butthead is just out of this world. The Movie is 10x Funnier than those stupid animated comedy tv shows the little kids watches! B &B Would kid Barney the Dinosaur in the nads, they would murder Elmo, and they would destroy the tickle me elmo doll (not seen in movie, just a fact ppl). Yes Cornholio makes his apearance twice! Yes they still got the joke like when some guy says "Enterian Us" Butthead would say "He Said Anus". An No They still won't get a chance to score. But That's what the movie is all about. And at the end, they finally got ther TV Back! Get the movie (without leting your parents knowing) 
 All Mod Cons is undeniably the best album released by The Jam. Some may argue that Setting Sons is, but in my mind All Mod Cons, sums up the essence of The Jam. Paul Weller's writing on this album was huge departure from the 2 albums released prior to it and this album clearly demonstrated the classic Jam sound. This is a 'must have' album for any fan of The Jam, or any Mod fan for that matter 
 This is an excellent cookbook that I go to for everything from soups, deserts, conversions, cooking times, etc.  I haven't made a bad dish yet and have been cooking from this book for 6 years.  My husband and I received it as a wedding present and it has been a golden reference.  If you are looking for a good basic cookbook, this is the one for you.  Many of the recipes provide some geographical or historical context for the dish, which I find interesting and makes for great dinner conversation.  Don't be intimidated by the length or number of ingredients in some of the recipes.  These such recipes provide that flavor layering effect which takes the taste of the finished project off the charts!      
 First published in 1949, The Moving Target is one of Ross Macdonald's earlier novels.  Action packed and nicely paced, the narrative of this book is noticeably less convoluted than many of the other entries in the Macdonald canon. As hardboiled PI Lew Archer searches high and low to locate missing millionaire Ralph Sampson, he encounters more than a few very interesting characters along the way.  These include Sampson's paraplegic wife Elaine, his headstrong 20 year old daughter Miranda, Claude a bearded prophet of questionable repute and Fay Estabrook an aging film star who doubles as an astrologer. While successfully relating this intriguing mystery, Macdonald simultaneously manages to paint a vivid picture of life in the Southern California of the immediate postwar era. The Moving Target is an engaging detective novel that deftly brings to life the place and time in which it unfolds.  Must reading for those who enjoy California noir 
 Very cute book with good advice for writing notes 
 And if you're new to the genre, perhaps the bluegrass CD period to get first.  With the exception of the Carter family, I've never heard harmonies that sound this absolutely inspired and otherworldly.  And like the Carter family, these songs succintly concern similar thematic territory:  parent's dying, a better life in heaven, lost love.  The bluegrass played by the Stanley Brothers looks directly to the mountain music of the Appalachian Mountains for inspiration, which they mixed with the contemporary (at the time) edge of the Bill Monroe that defined the bluegrass genre.  There is so much depth and real life experience that easily comes through in these songs.  This is music that will be listened to forever.  I doubt that the feeling that these musicians so easily put forth could be successfully copied or reproduced by anyone with anything that approach the warmth and emotion of these recordings.    I'm not quite sure if any CD release of the same material matches this compilation (recording between 1949 - 1952) in terms of sound quality.  And if sound quality is concern, these mono recordings sound as rich and flawless as just about anything recorded at the time (there is some unobtrusive crackling sounds), and I assume that Columbia Records has worked hard to skillfully remaster this music of the Stanley Brothers at their prime.   
 This slender tome won't tell you much you couldn't learn from David Halberstam's far denser treatment of this decade in his lively book "The Fifties."  Nor will it provide the context necessary for a complete grasp of any of the discrete subjects touched upon, such as the golden age of television, the early civil rights movement, the Korean War, the Cold War, the nuclear family, or the Eisenhower administration.  And of course no history book could hope to accurately capture the experiences of all who lived in the very large and diverse USA during any decade.  But this is an engaging summary of the cultural generalizations that can be made about this time and place, and an excellent outline of the experiences shared by many Americans such as the cold war, the fear of communism, nuclear anxieties, the influence of television, and conformist pressures.  This would be a good introduction for late high schoolers, early college students, or any history novice who simply wants a bird's-eye view.  Alternatively, this would be a good book to read after Halberstam's book, and other more in-depth treatments, to reinforce the salient points.  The well-chosen photographs provide further insights.      
 My daughter is 5 and we've just finished reading this book together.  I love this book on so many levels that I have trouble putting words down.  Funke (or Funke's translator, not sure which) delivers a page-turning, compelling story about adventure, friendship, loyalty and doing the right thing.  She does all of this amid perfect sentence structure, flawless grammar, strong character development, larger than life imagery and unparalleled story telling.  I have not a single complaint about this book other than it's not long enough!  Oh how we both long for more!  I read this book to my daughter for an hour each night at bedtime (remember, she's only 5) and usually an hour each day.  There were many wonderful opportunities for discussion about lessons in the book and new vocabulary for my daughter.  There are no truly "bad guys" in this book (aside from Nettlebrand whose life is borrowed anyway) and those who made some poor decisions are given opportunities to redeem themselves in the end.  The characters are so strong and lovable!  I can't say enough about this book.  I do hope someone will take on the task of putting it to the big screen.  It will be a veritable feast for the eyes.  
 SPOILERS AHEAD (if it's possible given the title of the book):   I love this book but I wonder if anyone, including the author, entirely understands what he has done here.  Does he think the deaths of the Lisbon girls mysterious, or is it only his unreliable narrator who thinks it, a man clearly haunted as much by adolescence itself as by five long-dead girls?  If you want this to stay mysterious, stop reading now.  I'm puzzled that anybody is puzzled why the Lisbon sisters all kill themselves.  There are clues all through the book:  at the prom, one sister asks if the boys took them out because they felt sorry for them.  One reportedly cries when she can't afford to get her messed up teeth fixed, something her parents either can't or won't pay for.  One says she feels like a charity child, attending this posh school because her father teaches there.  They are describe as wearing last year's school clothes because the mother won't buy them any that fit (which really poor families sometimes do at thrift shops--at least then they're the right size).  At the prom, they know their "shapeless sacks" dresses are wrong the minute the other girls look at them.  Obviously, as much as the boys idealize and romanticize them, the girls feel like freaks and justthisclose to being outcasts--like the retarded boy the kids make fun of at the party right before Cecilia kills herself.  If they don't band together and hide their family's dirty laundy, they'll be openly persecuted instead of just whispered about.  Trip dumps Lux not because they had sex, but because she showed emotional vulnerability.  "I always screw up," she says--not the stuff the Kewl Girl is supposed to say.  The boys don't call after the prom, even though Bonnie's date promises to.  They can't trust anyone;  no neighbor cares enough to call a Social Worker or truant officer when they're pulled out of school.  Aren't they worth rescuing?  Apparently not.  Why don't they run away?  Because their mother has told them all their lives boys only want them for one thing and will lose interest in them.  What little experience they have with boys bears this out.  They have no reason to believe the outside world will value them when their own parents don't and boys who get to know them even slightly seem to lose interest.  They don't fully trust the ones who are crushing on them at the end because they figure they'll just get bored too if the girls don't stay on the pedestal.  Bonnie's date won't call her, but he parts his hair the way she liked it when he's middle-aged--he doesn't want a real girl, he wants a fantasy.  When Mary commits suicide a month after her sisters died, it's on the day of another girl's debut party--the kind of party to which she will never be invited, let alone give.  She can't escape to college because she wasn't allowed to finish high school.  And she figures she must be worthless, because after all that, the hospital sent her back home, just as they sent Cecilia home.  They sent her home to a mother who apparently never did laundry or had the girls do it, given the state of the bedlinens when the house is cleaned out.  The mother treats them like trash so that's how they feel, isolated in this middle class neighborhood where other people have debutante parties.  We don't know if there was physical abuse, but there is clearly emotional abuse, and it is hard to get authorities to intervene in such cases even now, let alone in those days when you had to show a broken bone or a broken hymen before anyone would do anything.  Eugenides has brilliantly depicted the pathetic attempts of psychologists and reports to explain the suicides away with fancy arcane theories about rock music and Rorschachs, when the girls are obviously miserable because they want to fit in and are never allowed to.  The naivete of the boys is understandable, and it's sweet and accurate how they would be dazzled by the glamor of the sisters' feminine preening tools:  mustache bleach creams and feminine hygiene supplies, when the girls obviously were afraid of being ugly and gross.  But the cluelessness of the school, with its Day of Grieving, and the callous indifference of the neighbors--except for the one old Greek lady who deplores the American custom of pretending to be happy, like covering over Cecilia's scars with perky bracelets (what a brilliant image the author has there!)--the fact that "normal" well-adjusted adults allowed this to happen is disgusting.  And disgustingly typical of suburbia, with its constant cover-ups.  If something goes wrong in a slum, every tenement neighbor knows it.  And slum kids know that if they commit a felony, the authorities will pull them out of the parents' house, and it won't be hushed up the way it is with "nice" families.  They'll have to do time in a juvenile facility, which may be an improvement over home.  Nice girls like the Lisbons don't know how to work the system.  Eugenides has done a magnificent job of telling the readers, if they care to look, everything the sisters didn't know how to tell the world.  One of the points of this book is how easy it is for people to ignore the obvious.  When we leave the girls mysterious, when we aestheticize them, we are implicated along with the people in the book who aren't interested in them as real people.  Many readers have complained the girls are indistinguishable, except for Cecilia and Lux. But I believe the point is that just because we don't know about people, doesn't mean there is nothing to know.  Ever read a poem called "Richard Corey"?  We as readers, and the now grown-up boys, can idealize the Lisbons because they are safely dead, and won't interfere with our haunting little fantasies with any of their troubling reality.  No wonder the boys prefer these convenient ghosts to their wives.  "We just want to live, if people would let us," says one of the girls.  
 No review could possibly do this one any amount of justice it deserves... the opening few snippets could nearly bring a tear to my eye with it's supreme absurdity. I love these guys (and girl). It culminates each and every possible style of music, from jewish chants (I guess that's the sound on 4:29 in "Turn Table Boredoms") to noise, to surf music, jazz, lounge and punk... they happily lifted all stops and boundaries, shooting through the gates of creativity at lightening-fast speed. I could name certain cranial pleasers like "Now Dom Go Synthesizer Way (Why?)" and "Shock City", but in (un)reality, each song is an adventure unto itself. "B For Boredoms" is a party anthem that never was. "Anarchy In The UKK" ends with more screaming than a horde of rabid chihuahuas. "Smoke 7" takes you on a ride through the Metro in a bullet train; and "Tomato Synthesizer" is just plain weird. Oh, and they don't have any lyrics... mostly gibberish and vocal sounds by frontman Eye. This release will echo genious for ages to come. Get this, you scummy maggot, or I'll have you for breakfast 
 This was an excellent story with extremely well developed characters.  Although, I have never before been close to experiencing what the characters of this book were challenged with, I was able to identify with all of the characters.  The plots and twists are engaging and it is obvious how much time and research the author put into entertaining his reader!  Thanks Jeffrey 
 The title of this concise book says it all. Coming from an evangelical orientation, the collection of essays in this book on the family focus on (no pun intended) the depiction of the family in the varied times and contexts of the biblical canon. While the book itself is not organized thematically-there are, logically, two parts: Part 1: Family in the Old Testament, and Part 2: Family in the New Testament-some of the contributing writers do approach their treatment thematically. The chapters provide responsible reviews of the biblical content when it pertains to families, describing, but also interpreting, the ways that the family is understood in the section of the Bible under review. The family, as a social unit, is presented in the cultural contexts of the grand scope of the ever-evolving biblical worldviews in the canon. The writing is impressively tight, consistently so, allowing for a rich biblical background resource in a short 175 pages.   	Some will undoubtedly be disappointed at a lack of an overall definitive statement about what the Bible has to say about families today-in social, political, ecclesial, or theological contexts. Only one contributor to the volume strays long enough from the biblical evidence to address at any length issues related to, for example, feminist interpretations of the family in scripture. In fact, in the one chapter that a contributor attempted to provide implications for the contemporary family, the statements come across as an overreach of the text and its message. The editors seem content to allow the treatment on the family to remain focused in the text and its context. As such, the conclusions offered in most chapters are short on interpretation and implications for the contemporary family. For those needing more, this may lead to an assumption that the Bible has nothing to say about families for the contemporary world. But that would be a misunderstanding of both the intent and message of this book.   	This is a worthy contribution to both biblical studies and fields whose main concern is the family and its place and role in society. The editorial light touch has ensured that the contributors' personal voices contribute to the uniqueness and richness of this work. This is important, given the varied backgrounds of the writers, including England, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, as well as the United States. This will become a standard work for every academic library.  
 Job 5:8 "But as for me, I would seek God,And I would place my cause before God."  Psalm 9:10 "And those who know Your name will put their trust in You,For You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You."  Psalm 14:2 "The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of menTo see if there are any who understand,Who seek after God."  Psalm 22:26b "Those who seek Him will praise the LORD Let your heart live forever!"  Psalm 70:4 "Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;And let those who love Your salvation say continually,"Let God be magnified."  If you seek an ardent devotional life, if you want to have a life of prayer, if you are looking for a guide on how to dwelve in the Word and reap the benefits of the Bille's wisdom, than look no more.  Here is what I wrote my relatives and friends as a result of one morning's Bible reading of 2 Tim. 1:1-14 (suggested reading for that day). "I'm not here to push this book, but I want to say that my spiritual walk with God, on a day to day basis, starting the day and ending the day, has been very enriched as a result of reading the Scripture passages, meditating on the excerpts from spiritual writings and poems, and praying, with the help of this devotional book."  The structure of the book is fairly simple.  Week by week (according to the Christian calendar).  Each week's daily devotions and texts are broken up in the following 8 categories:  I. Invocation (written),  II. One of the Psalms (as a prayerful reading material) III. Reading for Reflection (various numbers of little excerpts from spiritual writing from the whole rich treasure chest of Christian history and from all various denominational and traditional Christian faiths), IV. Daily Scripture Readings (Mon.-Sunday.; some of them are long  like a whole chapter; others very short) V. Reflection: Silent and Written  VI. Prayers: For the Church, for Others, and Myself (no prayers provided but one is asked to pray for these three areas) VII. Hymn (written) VIII. Benediction (written).  You will not be sorry you invested the money in this book.  The challenge is making the time to devote your life, heart, mind, soul to God and reap the benefits of your closeness to the divine.  Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox - friendly.  The authors come from the Methodist tradition but are very ecumenically minded 
 It's unclear to me how such wonderful plays could have escaped my reading for this long.    A casual conversation led me to get this book in order to read the emotionally jarring "The Children's Hour."  But that ended up only being the icing on the cake.  Every one of the plays in this book display Hellman's mastery of dramatic form, story development, and the anti-climax.    She is direct and yet somehow understated.  It's a wonder to me that her name is not mentioned more often in the context it deserves, as a great American playwright.  I believe those who see her in the shadow of other playwrights should rethink their comparisons.  Hellman stands on her own and deserves careful consideration.  In any event, I think everone should read these plays and decide for themselves.  Of particular interest to me is the play "Days to Come."  On the surface it tells the story of a small town dealing with the pressures of Organized Labor and Organized Crime.  But there is a subtext of human turmoil that is executed expertly.  The second act is particularly sharp, with great dialogue that challenges you to read between the lines.  While the complexity and number of character might make this a tough production for a small independant playhouse, there is much in her writing to be admired.  I'm glad I took the opportunity to read what I believe to be gems in the rough.  I hope more people will do the same 
 This is certainly one of Nora Roberts' better novels.  As always, she creates a realistic setting, herein the delightful village of Ardmore, County of Waterford Ireland.  In fact, Ms. Roberts is about the best writer working today in creating a getaway setting for her plots.  For this alone, the book is worth the time to read.  As an aside, the town Ms. Roberts describes actually exists, pretty much as we see it in this trilogy.  There is a ruined church dedicated to Ireland's first Christian, St. Declan, and there is a round tower on the hill overlooking Ardmore and the sea on the south coast of Ireland.  The population of Ardmore is about 300 people.  However, there is no known pub there named Gallaghers.  Too bad.    What makes this book stand above the first and third books of the Irish trilogy is the character of Brenna O'Toole, a young woman who works beside her handyman father and dresses like him.  Readers have seen far too many frilly, bosomy heroines and young Lochinvar heroes.  It's a pleasant departure to find a heroine full of contradictions and with earthy overtones.  The plot is more than somewhat predictable, alas.  Anyone who has read one or two of this writer's novels knows exactly what is going to occur.  Man and woman are introduced to the reader.  They clash, even as they are attracted to one another physically.  There will be a sex scene about half way through the book, in this case a far more specific scene than usual.  Then there will be at least one or more similar scenes before the inevitable happy ending.  The ending here is a bit of a downer, in that Brenna is, to my thinking, humiliated in a very painful way for no good reason.  It leaves a rather bitter taste for the reader who has read it all.  But let us not quibble too much.  Nora Roberts is a very good writer.  Her settings, her characters, her dialogue--all are excellent.  One can only wish that she might surprise the reader by not using the same plot formula again and again 
 Loved this book as a kid.  Now I'm 41 and my children love it as well.  
 Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment turned out to be a great cleanser. I have a little acne on my chest and it didn't break out fully in the five days that I've used this product and I don't think it will. The body wash foamed up nicely using a body puff and has a very light clean smell. This product is perfect for the spring and summer months when my shoulders, back, and chest are more likely to see the light of day! I think a month of this product would give even better results. I plan on continuing to use it 
 In a way I shudder at the idea of reviewing a book like Philip D. Curtin's "The Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex: Essays in Atlantic History" for the simple fact that a book containing fourteen detailed essays is daunting to summarize. Which essay should receive the most attention? The reviewer of Curtin's book soon realizes that such a question does not have an easy answer. Nearly all of the articles contained in this slim volume warrant far more attention than I can give them in a 1000 word review. I'll have to resort to sweeping generalization in the main, most likely, but that's acceptable considering the focus of these writings deals with a sweeping topic. Atlantic history is metahistory, encompassing as it does some three or four hundred years and stretching through Europe, Africa, South America, the Caribbean, and North America. It is also a story filled with tales of exploration, greed, bondage, and freedom. Atlantic history is a hot topic from what I've gathered, what with books like Marcus Rediker's "The Many Headed Hydra" gaining quite a lot of attention in the academic world. Then again, maybe I think it's a pressing subject since I've read several books on the theme for a class at school.  Curtin focuses on the rise and spread of the plantation complex, which he calls an "entity," beginning with the discovery of sugar in the Mediterranean during the time of the Crusades. Located primarily on the island of Cyprus, Europeans harvested sugar there for roughly two hundred years. With the reconquest of the Levant by Muslims, growers and consumers sought out new sources of the product. Enter the slow move into the New World and the introduction of a plantation structure that was feudalistic in nature, relied on slave labor, and was controlled by a political system overseas. The "true" plantation existed solely for profit, for supplying goods for distant markets, and needed slaves to operate the fields because the European populations had not yet overcome the numerous diseases and hardships found in the harsh climes of South America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Had Europeans merely waited until they built up immunity to diseases, argues Curtin, it's quite possible slavery as we recognize it today might never have existed. He also posits the interesting observation that plantations in the American South were not "true" plantations and as such receive little mention in his articles. He's more interested in the large European concerns spreading like a plague through South America and the Caribbean.  Curtin doesn't solely examine the structure of the plantation, although he does spend some time discussing the geography of a typical sugar plantation, the types of buildings found there, how the goods went to market, and how the same forms adapted to different climates. He throws in a detailed examination of the African slave trade, how it arose, who participated in it (both Europeans and Africans readily engaged in the selling of human beings), and argues that the decline and fall of powerful African states led to an increase in the number of people available for the slave markets. The author also argues that the plantation, no matter what its location, represented a form of "cultural demography" in that the Europeans who built them moved into a region and supplanted the local population (most of them died) with non-native inhabitants. The racial and social composition of our world today is largely a result of the plantation system and the demographic changes it wrought. It's an amazing claim and one that, if accepted, equals in importance the barbarian migrations that rocked the Roman world in the fourth and fifth centuries.  Curtin postulates some theories to help explain the demise of the plantation complex, too. He contends that the democratic revolutions in the New World and Europe put an end to these exploitative economic enterprises, primarily the series of rebellions that resulted in an independent Haitian state in 1804 but also including the American and French Revolutions. Even moderate attempts at democratization in England helped bring about the abolishment of slavery (remember, American plantations don't count) and thus sealed the plantation complex's doom. Also lending a hand was the emergence of the European Enlightenment, which tended to look at non-western lands and people as "exotic," a view that planted the seeds for later anti-slavery movements and increased attention to what was going on in the mother country's backwaters. By the 1880s Brazil was freeing slaves to SAVE money because droughts and laws aimed at preventing the importation of new slaves decreased their value to the point that it was too expensive to keep them around.  "The Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex" makes abundant use of detailed maps and graphs, something that, as incredible as it sounds, many history books fail to do. I did have two quibbles with the book. The first is the atrocious editing, or should I say lack of editing, that plagues nearly every page of this book. Errors are so numerous that the flow of the text is seriously hampered. And none other than Cambridge University Press published it! My second problem centers on Curtin's complaints about "Eurocentric" history and how historians ought to look beyond that bias. That might have been a problem in 1990 when the book first appeared, but even a cursory glance at the history section in the local bookstore today will reveal dozens of titles written from a decidedly non-European point of view. Despite these niggling problems, Curtin's book is a good read for both historians and interested laypersons (laypeople?) intrigued by the subject. 
 This is the best book available on the Great Storm of 1900 and its effect on Galveston, Texas. An unbelievable amount of research obviously went into it. Very well written. Highly recommended 
 Jeanne Dams writes very entertaining mysteries featuring a senior citizen sleuth transplanted from the US to a small village in England.  In this latest, she travels to London.  While on the train she meets a young  American on his first visit to the country.  She looks forward to showing  him some of the sights, but before the trip is over, the young man is dead  and the mystery begins 
 I suggest prerequisite readings to anyone who really wants to get the most out of this extremely well written book.  You need to understand the basics of quantum mechanics.  For that, first read Gary Zukav's masterpiece "The Dancing Wu Li Masters" followed by Fritov Capra's "The Tao of Physics."  The latter covers the same basic principles but from a perspective that adds to overall understanding.  Follow these with Amit Goswami's masterpiece, "Physics of the Soul."  All three books are written for laypeople. You really need to understand quantum physics for yourself to believe it's incredible implications which McTaggert discusses so well.  On the other hand, if you read "The Field" with no understanding of QP, you might not appreciate how very "real" are the amazing things discussed in this book.  Castaneda fans will instantly realize that Carlos "knew" regardless of whether or not Don Juan was real 
 Ghost Game is a very enjoyable movie.  It has suspense and kept me guessing what was going to happen next, unlike alot of horror movies where one can pretty much figure out what's going to happen next.  The effects and music were great. 
 Pass It On is a beautiful picture book of some of BlackAmerica's best poems for children. Here the reader will find examplesof the wonderful works of Langston Hughes, Nikki Giovanni, Countee Cullen, and about thirteen others. From the Harlem Rennaisance to the present day lovely thought-provoking poems are presented to the American child. The illustrations are muted but descriptive renderings that are melded together to present a picture of black life at its best 
 I have been blessed to attend several of his workshops & have met  & talked with him  in person & frequently email back & forth,  He is a very very special person & he helped me successfully control a  life threatening  rare illness so I could use the illness as a gift &  catalyst for living well & being able to achieve my dreams -Marsha  Lampert MBA MS Wantagh N 
 This should be required reading for every martial artist! I have recomended this to practicing martial artists as well as those thinking about studying. I really can't say enough about this book. I would give more than 5 stars if I could 
 As a Chiropractor I study the miricles of life and the riddles of the bible and history.  This book was worth reading and should be read by everyone 
 Peter Robinson is a winner.  He quickly immerses you in his story, tantalizes you with suspects and plot twists, and accompanies it all with excellent description of the Yorkshire countryside.  He makes you feel you live there.  He makes you feel you know the people he writes about.  And beyond that, he rarely indulges in cheap plot tricks and serendipitous gimmicks to move his plot along.  He unfolds the story at a nice, slow (but not too slow) pace.  All in all, he's a masterful writer who puts a lot of effort into delivering a top-notch novel.  And this is one of his best 
 Donald Hall has taken his greatest pain and laid it out in verse so touching, so unsentimental, and so clear, that the reader shares.  And cries.  This book is a powerful testament to love and to poetry, and  ultimately has a healing effect on the poet and the reader.  Exquisite 
 I bought this bed for my 2 year old daughter.  It is a very pretty pink bed.  It is perfect for a little girl.  My daughter loves Strawberry Shortcake.  The first night she slept in it she layed down and didn't get up. She slept through the night. She was proud of her new bed.  The bed is tough to put together.  It does need two people to put it together 
 It is a suspense thriller. Very nicely written. It is very engrossing, once i started reading felt like finishing the book at once. Very very nice thriller 
 This was one of those fabulous 80's movies that Shelley Long made after her surprising "Cheers" departure. As a kid growing up, I loved this movie because it was so funny. My brother and I would watch it all the time, it got to a point where we memorized most of the lines (...blue-light special, isle three...cookies...)  "Troop Beverly Hills" is a the story of a Beverly Hills homemaker (who's going through a divorce) that attempts to lead her daughter's wilderness girl troop. Phyllis Nefler (played by "Cheers" star Shelley Long) leads this group of spoiled Beverly Hills princesses.  Along their journey, they learn how to be "real wilderness girls" in a non conventional way while fighting the evils of Vesta Plendor (played by the very funny Betty Thomas.) Vesta will stop at nothing to prove Phyllis and her troop are nothing more than a group of pampered Beverly Hills brats.   Audra Lindley (Mrs. Roper from "Three's Company") also has a small part in this movie as Francis Temple, the good-natured wilderness girl official. Ironically, Tori Spelling (of 90210 fame) also has a small part belittling the girls from Beverly Hills!  This is a great movie for kids or teenagers because it has a positive message. It is also very wholesome, there isn't any s-e-x in this movie, or any profane language 
 This is a great album! The songs that really put the album together are... Oh yea The whole album is perfect!!! If your looking at this album it is a grfeat thing to buy. Can you find out why there is a big break after the song "St. Robinson in his Cadillac Dream" Well I have. I hope you find out!!! 
 When I recently picked up this book again to re-read it, what I remembered best about it were the author's impressive honesty and the insights that gave me into my relations with my own mother.  This time I was struck by how gracefully she handles the language and tells her story. Ever since my Jane Austen kick a few years ago I have found myself putting down books that I believed had something to say because I didn't like the way they were saying it. Not so here. This book is thought-provoking, and it is also a pleasure to read (but not if you're looking for something light-hearted!). I think it would appeal to a wider audience than those especially drawn to it for its focus on grief and on mother-daughter relations. I hope the author will write more 
 As practically every other reviewer has noted, this is by far my favorite Christmas album of all time, and one that I listened to on vinyl as a child.   Not only is the music itself fantastic, but it truly is a Christian Christmas album. You won't find mommy kissing Santa Claus on any of these cuts. Instead you'll find old-time classics with meaning like "Away in a Manger," "Silent Night," and "Rise Up Shepherds" interspersed with short and beautifully read Bible verses.   This is an album that embraces the true spirit of Christmas. If you have any doubts, just listen to a few of the clips and you'll be hooked. Buy it, and know that in generations to come your family will still be listening to these songs 
 It doesn't appear that the reader from Los Angeles read this particular book; it seems he/she simply took this space as an opportunity to rant about Andrew Ross and other vaguely related issues. Ross's book is a nuanced look at the peculiar culture of the new media workplace, just as the golden years began to fade. Considering that Ross was not actually an employee of Razorfish, the main company in his case study, his perspective is surprisingly sensitive. After spending the dot-com golden years in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, I was prepared to scoff at an outsider's interpretation of what the new media workplace was like, and how it felt to be an employee of that workplace. I was further prepared to roll my eyes at his choice of exploring New York's new media world rather than making the trip to the heart of it all, the San Francisco Bay Area. But in the end I was impressed: he explains his reasons for choosing New York, and they make sense. And he hits the nail on the head in terms of what was most odd and most interesting--as well as most consequential--about the feel-good, creative, ambitious new media work environment. The book grows significantly more "readable" after the first few chapters give way to more anecdotal scene-setting and conversations with Razorfish employees 
 We picked this up at the library because I loved the illustrations and could not be happier that we did!  It takes a feminist theme (that appealed greatly to my two boys)along with liberal amounts of Spanish language (glossary included) and weaves them into a magical story, complete with talking animals and fanciful glass creations.  The illustrations are perfect (my three year old found them quite funny)and the prose is lilting and quite satisfying to read out loud.  It incorporates so many wonderful themes---a multicultural outlook, empowerment of girls, magical happenings,the journey while disguised, etc.--that it should become a classic in schools and homes everywhere.  "Bravo!"    
 Frankly, the idea of a Secret Service Agent having an affair with the President's wife is way out there in the first place. (Michael Douglas not withstanding).  If you like Keefer Sutherland (as in TV's 24) you will probably like this movie (his name could have been Jack Bower in  this flick too.  I thought it had good action, writing, acting and directing.  I would not mind seeing Keefer and Michael teamed up again on the same side.  I bought the dvd, but then again I collect movies for the actors. 
 This is a valuable book for the inside track on the Bond films. Director John Glen did a good job. His services will be greatly missed unless they get him back. After reading this book perhaps the producers should get John Glen back. 
 I like this book because it offers advice on creating written comedy.It teaches you how to write,where to get ideas from and put those ideas together.There are plenty of exercises to follow so keep a note book handy if you buy this book.  The author writes in an easy to understand way.Doesnt get boring like other books.No matter what,you will gain something from this book.And,there's a few laughs too.  If you want to do stand -up comedy this book should be considered for your collection of books .It will help.I would recommend these books specifically for stand -up comedy: 1)"Zen and the art of stand-up comedy" By Jay Sankey. 2)"The comedy bible".By Judy Carter 
 Koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late 1500s. The career and tactics of this Admiral are still studied at the U.S. Naval Academy, and doubtless those of other nations. The screenplay is based on a couple of novels, so there is some fiction, but the life of Yi Soon Shin was well documented, so there's plenty of fact supporting the story.   If you are not familiar with Korean Drama, it's good to keep in mind that  this is not a Hollywood product, but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non-Hollywood budgets involved, and it's easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told.   It's a long series, but presents an epic with power, depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode.  It would be great also to see KBS make other dramas available for viewing through Amazon, such as "Seoul 1945".       
 It's not a book based on plot or persuasion; merely a book which presents incredible feelings and ideas in a fantastic way. Often we have all wondered about the true nature of simply BEING.  Often we feel as though the world passes us by, or hunts us, or seeks to confuse us.  Pessoa simply puts these feelings into beautifully flowing prose.  Complex ideas and feelings are written of so skillfully that I feel as if we had been the same person.  This book is well worth reading 
 High Contrast is with out doubt one of the top drum n bass DJ/producers in the world.  This mix for the fabriclive set is most definitely up to par.  With a wide array of different styles of beats, Lincoln Barret takes you through the every expanding realm of Drum n Bass.  Although the entire disc is good, the last 7 songs are outstanding.  A good purchase for anyone interested in D n  
 that nobody will mention. That being the role of organized American Jewry in spending enormous amounts of time, organization, and effort to overturn the 1924, 1952 laws and the national origins system. There should have been a better treatment of this issue in the book. Although it is argued that many groups wanted to disregard the status quo ideals in place since 1924, it was Jewry that provided the bulk of the effort, culminating in their "victory" in 1965 over White European Americans and the opening of the floodgates. How is this not emphasized more clearly? And why not? Jewry's goal was to make the USA multi-cultural, and diminish the percentages of White America, the rationale being that Jewry would be safer in a country where they were not an easily recognizable and identifiable minority. Some say that Jewry's enemy is the White (European) descended-man, and their effort to affect immigration laws to weaken the whiteness of America was no accident, and the result of much organized lobbying and sustained effort. This is critical to understanding why we are a melting pot today, and who wanted this nation to become diverse, for divide and conquer purposes.  But this should have been better discussed. For this reason, I cannot give it 5 stars.  Jewry thought in 1952 that the McCarran-Walter law was only a temporary setback and they was right. Thirty years after the triumph of restrictionism, only Jewish groups remained as persistent and tenacious advocates of a multicultural America. Forty-one years after the 1924 triumph of restrictionism and the national origins provision and only 13 years after its reaffirmation with the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, Jewish organizations successfully supported ending the geographically based national origins basis of immigration.    The rest they say is history.   
 This is a more reflective book than Lamott's others.  The tone is deeper, darker at times, and more reverent.  It is just as honest and almost as funny, but the maturation that is going on inside her is so palpable that it trumps all else.       
 Wow, does this machine get out the dirt!  I went over an area of my carpet that I'd just cleaned with my old vacuum, and it's as if it had never been vacuumed before.  This machine is very intelligently designed.  The attachments are convenient and easy to use.  The pet-hair attachment doesn't have its own motor, but it still does fairly well on stairs, etc.  As others have mentioned, the vacuum is heavy, and using it is a workout experience, which is how I treat it.  I vacuum a little with each arm and take a break about halfway through (my entire house is carpeted).  I only wish that there were a way to control the amount of suction.  One can raise the "carpet height" and that helps a little, but there's still too much suction to use on rugs, either with the base or with the attachments.  I would suggest a little valve that one can open somewhere on the shaft.  That would take care of the problem.  On the whole, though, I'm very pleased with my new vacuum 
 Ideas Are Free: How The Idea Of Revolution Is Liberating People And Transforming Organizations by Alan G. Robinson (Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts) and Dean M. Schroeder (Associate Dean and Director of Graduate Programs in Management at the College of Business Administrations at Valparaiso University) is an innovative guide to saving money, effort, time and also provides an informative introduction to entirely new ways of doing business with front-line employees, making the most out of opportunities and maximizing the benefits of sound, effective management. Robinson and Schroeder aptly examine the intricacies of the business life and include an analysis of a more prosperous, ease-filled advancement for opportunities granted to all, and situational manipulation for a more competently finalized project. Ideas Are Free is very highly recommended reading for all business consultants, corporate executives and departmental managers. 
 Abbott and Costello's humor is outstanding and timeless. This collection of some of their movies will keep you laughing uproariously, and you will find yourself watching these movies over and over again and still keep laughing, even after you've watched them so much you know what's going to happen next 
 if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing... 
 This is an easy read, endlessly entertaining, and perfect.  It's a strong character study and will help one assess family relationships.  Loved the book 
 In my sophmore year of high school, in my U.S. History class, we're wrapping up the Vietnam War unit, and I saw this book had a little column in there.  I knew I had the book I attempted to read it at least twice, but always got distracted; so I finally picked it up and read it through front to back.  "A Rumor of War" is an amazing account of a man's journey through the desolate jungles of Vietnam during that war.  If you're fascinated with Vietnam War or just enjoy reading; pick this up and read it 
 Traditional graphics textbooks did not contain programmable real-time shading techniques. This book is a good example to fill in this gap. In my opinion, university can start a new course teaching programmable real-time shading... 
 This fantastic DVD supplements the great Changes recordings on Atlantic. The centerpiece performance here is an extended version of the Mingus composition Sue's Changes, which perhaps tops in excitement the recorded version on Changes One. The Adams/Pullen/Walrath Quintet is also featured on Free Cell Block F, and on the Devil Blues. (For Harry Carney is unfortunately not included in this DVD.) The concert closes with two performances adding and featuring guest artists Gerry Mulligan and Benny Bailey, performing a superb Goodbye Pork Pie Hat and Take the A Train. The sound quality of the recording is quite good--Mingus is clear and in great form at all times (this is definitely before his playing declined with illness)--with the exception that George Adams is a bit undermiked. There are many great images in this DVD. Anyone appreciative of the last great Mingus group will love this DVD.   
 I have read each of Tananarive Due's books and have enjoyed them immensely. This account of Madame CJ Walker's life was such an enjoyable read. I am thankful that Ms. Due reminded readers in the end that this was a book of fiction because I had become so engrossed in the storyline, I must admit that I forgot it was fiction. I did not know much about the life of Madame Walker but this story shed a lot of light and most of all it stressed for me that you must not allow fear to stand in your path. I will continue to support anything written by Tananarive Due and thanks for a wonderful story 
 I got this after Echo Park and found that it wasn't as good as it. This is a great album with a lots of different kinds of tracks on it with the mellow songs including "Tinsel Town" "Dry" "So Well" & "Paperfaces" (Paperfaces being by favourite) and the heavier and faster songs including "Insomnia" "Hole In My Head" & "My Evergreen". So a brilliant compilation of fantastic songs. Better than Polythene & Swim but Echo Park is my fave. Best songs - Yesterday Went Too Soon, Hole In My Head, Paperfaces, My Evergreen 
 I want to first start off by saying that this song is beautiful, deep, and meaningful.  Some of the other reviewers don't seem to grasp that.  This song was used as kind of an anthem after the Hurricane Katrina disaster, and in my opinion inspires hope in people rather than sounding like a "funeral dirge".  As for them having "lost their rocker souls and settled for being banal", nothing they ever put out will be soulless or boring.  As for the comment that they are "too old and now care more about sales instead of where they came from", I just don't agree with that at all.  No one ever gets anywhere by staying the same, and you have to know where you came from in order to know where you're going.  I love the way the Goos are growing, and everything John Rzeznik writes just gets better and better (which can't be easy).  These guys are great!!!  Definitely buy "Better Days" or anything else they release 
 At last, a book that would be the perfect gift for my sister who lived some years in India.  It has 690 pages with recipes like coriander and apple chicken, mango pickles, potato stuffed baati rolls, and Indian style french toast (yogurt, cilantro, top with chutney). The recipes marked with V are vegan and the ones marked with P use a pressure cooker.  This covers all the regional flavors of India from Punjab to Gujarat 
 This is a fantastic book! I am an old married woman with an african grey parrot, and I just recently read Harry's Mad. It's a great story, fun to read and well-written. I loved it, and I highly reccommend it 
 We Love it! Best purchase I have made in a long time! At first I thought it was a little too much to spend on a metal detector...  This is in the middle range and very easy to use. I bought it as a family project, something we all could do. In the first 3 months of purchasing it we have found 3 diamond rings, 2 gold watches, a bracelet, gold necklace and several old and valuable coins that date back to as early as 1890. Also it's a great hobbie and money maker. Worth every cent!! Don't forget to get the headphones---a MUST!!! Get it for a Christmas 2004 gift, your gift will keep them busy and keep giving back all year long 
 My husband have been enjoying the recipes in this book, particularly the smoothies!! We feel so good after starting the day with a fresh fruit & flax smoothie! We're sending Mom one today. Enjoy 
 Wonderfully designed "space age" toaster....Gently lowers bread automatically into toaster...Toasting is even and accurate...We have been using this toaster for a few weeks at my mother's home and we like it and so does she...easy controls... it's expensive (too expensive for us personally...) and it seems like more toaster than anyone needs...but... Pushing down a lever isn't an issue for me but someone with severe hand and wrist problems might really find this toaster useful... 
 Another great book from the Frances series by Russell Hoban. In this episode, Frances's friend Albert is not very interested in playing with her, especially because she is a girl, so Frances turns to her sister Gloria for a playmate. When Frances and Gloria plan a "best friends" outing complete with an enormous picnic lunch, Albert reconsiders the wisdom of not being friends with girls. I like this one both for the positive development of the sometimes-difficult relationship between Frances and her little sister Gloria, but also for the portrayal of girls who like to play baseball and catch frogs. 
 This book gives an excellent and easy to read look at writing your college application essay.   If you are just going to read a book and not do the exercises, this is a great choice - it doesn't have any exercises. Instead, the emphasis is on finding your own voice and telling your story. For example, he gives a list of the most overused, deadly topics and then shows how you can write a really good essay on one of the "forbidden" topics. He also includes a number of sample essays with comments from real college admissions officers - so you can see for yourself the difference between good, bad and mediocre 
 I gotta admit I only saw like, on episode of this fun-filled spinoff from Laguna Beach. I am mostly a Laguna Beach fan, especially Lauren of course. However I was unable to watch this season religiously but thanks to the season DVD, now I can relive every precious moment. It's really a treat to see how these ladies work, live, and play. I'm glad that there will be a new season as well, looking forward to seeing more of Lauren and her cohorts 
 I offer a few quotes, but there are no spoilers here. Not a review so much as an honest attempt to anyone reading this series to be ultimately happier at it's conclusion.  ... as you near the end of this book, this series of books, this epic tale that took 22 years (published) from Book I to Book VII, you will come to a few pages that beg you to be content with the journey.  You will read phrases like "I hope you came to hear the tale, and not just munch your way through the pages to the ending."  and "Should you go on, you will surely be disappointed..."  and "There is no such thing as a happy ending"  and "And so, my dear Constant Reader, I tell you this: You can stop here..."  When you finish these paragraphs, do what I did... listen to what he is telling you. Follow his advice. Follow my advice.  Get yourself a paperclip and close off the rest of the book. Better yet, if you are weak and tempted... tear them out, burn them, shred them, drop them in the cat box.  SK is right... if you have waited for 22 years (as I have) to finish this tale, there is no ending that can possibly satisfy.  An epic tale is about the JOURNEY, not the destination. I have no idea what happens at the end... and yet I am satisfied 
 I like this book because I like its'  newspaper.   It showed me how Lily Rosie and Tess put a newspaper together.  It's a lot like the newsletter than Morgan and Julia and I write 
 Peter Krass has compiled 50 essays by different spectacularly successful entrepreneurs, among them Barry Diller, Michael Dell, Richard Branson, Harvey Firestone and Steve Case, in which they share lessons they learned in their life the hard way.    I strongly recommend this book to anyone thinking about a career as an entrepreneur, and to any parents wishing to plant the idea of being an entrepreneur in their children's' heads 
 Having worked in a number of health food stores over the years with riot grrrl feminists and more-vegan-than-thou punk rockers, I found this novel both fun and very realistic. (I also worked with many New Age hippy characters unfortunately absent from this book). Besides being a highly entertaining novel, it is also very creative. Rather than being structured around a traditional linear narrative, this novel is a collage of journal entries, letters, and zines. So if you're looking for a fun little novel about the punk subculture, activism, and granola, pour yourself a nice cold glass of carob soymilk, sit back, and enjoy.  
 Another great story from Amy Tan. Sad, haunting, & very hard to read at times. Not a quick read, but well worth the time 
 Before I saw this sequel, I had heard and read that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. It's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there are a lot of fun moments.  However, the film is a bit uneven. The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters, but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his "negotiation skills," he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.  An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. Andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.  F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn't measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it. 
 This book, the second in the Dream series, is about Kate Powell, a distant relative of the Templeton's that comes to live with them after her parents are killed in a car accident when  Kate is 8.  Kate is not beautiful like Margo or sophisticated like Laura.  She is an over achiever.  She feels that the only way to pay the Templeton's back for everything they've done for her is to be the best at what she does.  She's a whiz with numbers, so she becomes an accountant at a well-respected firm, with the hopes of soon becoming a partner.  She obsesses over everything, never feeling like she's good enough.  One day at work, she discovers that her father was accused of embezzling money and was faced with going to jail when he died. She also learns the Templeton's replaced the money he took, but never said anything to her.  Shortly after learning that, she is accused by the partners in her firm of embezzling from their clients and is asked to take a leave of absence until it can be resolved.  Destroyed and humiliated, she puts up a wall rather than fight the charges because she doesn't want her father's past revealed.  Enter Byron DeWitt, the new head of the Templeton hotel in Monterey.  Kate and Byron start out detesting each other, but learn to tolerate each other and eventually become friends.  The attraction between them develops over time.  Kate suffers severe stomach pains in his company twice, the second time landing her in the hospital against her wishes.  Kate finds out she has an ulcer and is near exhaustion.  She is taken back to Templeton House to recover.  Byron helps her begin an excerise and weight lifting program and that's when the attraction between them takes off.  With her career in shambles, Kate becomes a more active partner in Pretenses.  She has never been a people person, preferring to be alone with her calculator and spread sheets, but to her surprise, she enjoys her work there.  Of course, she is cleared of the embezzlement charges and is offered a partnership at her old firm, but she turns it down finally realizing that it wasn't as important as she thought it was.  She also realizes how important Byron is to her.  This was a wonderful story.  Nora Roberts knows how to develop her characters.  She is at her best when she writes her trilogies.  I highly recommend this series, but you should read them in order to follow the story from the beginning 
 Sarah Smiley offers us a glimpse into life as a military spouse with honesty and humor.  There are aspects to military life that seem foreign to those in the civilian world, but Sarah has done a fantastic job making this book entertaining to every reader.  She is spot on describing the humorous aspects of "spouses groups", military health care, etc.  A great, quick read!  
 This is an excellent book.  It is like taking the trip of a lifetime back to early 19th century Egyp 
 So, Panopticon arrives in the mail along with around twenty other albums that were purchased around various recommendations that were made in passing by a few fellow forum-goers. Never having heard the band before and not having much of an idea what to expect, I rip away the plastic wrap, pop the disc into my DVD drive, rip it, and get to listening.  For the next hour, I would be subject to the aural equivalent of a majestic ocean body slowly swallowing the very foundations of the Earth, leaving in its wake a vast landscape of weeping sorrow and glimmering hope. That magnificent and devastating ocean has a name - and that name is Isis.  Now, I don't have much of a clue as to where to go with this thing. Isis is not a hard band to describe, but it is very difficult to truly capture the essence of the sounds that extend from their instruments. Their music is a mostly instrumental, atmospheric, shifting beast that at times seems to extend out from your speakers and develop a sense of physical mass. This is heavy music... not the kind of heavy that slams you against the wall and leaves you with a splintered skull, but the kind of heavy that embraces and envelops you, weighs down on your very senses, and forcefully sweeps you away into the dark unknown. There are no double-bass runs, there are no blast beats, there are no solos, there are no "riffs"; there are only dense soundscapes littered with kinetic walls of aural energy, ambient stretches of space, and gently ringing guitars that embody the calm before the storm and make you welcome the inevitable devastation that is surely forthcoming.  The perfect display of all these things is in the opening track, "So Did We". The song comes in with a slow, simple drum pattern and reasonably heavy guitars that are soon joined by Aaron Turner's distant, hardcore-ish yells. Turner is surprisingly unobtrusive, so people who have an aversion to this kind of vocal style shouldn't have much to fear. Regardless, this only goes on for around thirty seconds before the vocals cut out, the distortion disappears, and twin guitars come in with interweaving melodies that continue onwards, shifting, morphing, and changing until a bit past the two minute mark, where the music lapses back to a sound similar to the introductory passage. At three minutes, one guitar takes on a sort of sludgy droning, while the other rings clearly in the forefront, creating an eerie and moving aural scene. Soon, the droning transforms into a wash of noisy guitar atmospherics that blend smoothly into the background, while the tranquil reverberations retain their prominence in the foreground. At just under four minutes, the background guitar suddenly comes to the front and quickly diminishes into a short stretch of feedback, before fading out and being replaced once again by clean twin guitar tapestries that weave in and out of each other to create a melancholy, sorrow-filled stretch of airy music that evolves and builds on itself until just past the six minute mark. At this point, everything hits a climax and explodes into a wall of sound so enormous that it escapes from your headphones, clings to your walls, and begins to slowly close in on you from the outside, the weeping guitars and powerful cymbal washes enveloping you so wholly that you cannot help but to let go and lose yourself in the vastness of it all. It's utterly massive, soul crushing music. I cannot express enough the kind of impact the last few minutes of this song has on me. It's unreal. Indescribable. If you only hear one Isis song in your life, hear this one.  ...and that, to one degree or another, is the sound of Isis. Unfortunately, this is the absolute high point of the album... and it's a shame that the band hits their peak so early. However, don't take that the wrong way. The rest of the album maintains a consistent and dynamic flow of quality, it just never really surpasses the celestial beauty and power of "So Did We" (save for possibly "In Fiction", which is also absolutely tremendous).  The instrumentation across Panopticon is very minimalistic. There is no doubt in my mind that the guys in Isis can play should the need arise, but all the sounds on this album lend to the creation of mood and atmosphere, to the creation of the overbearing leviathan that forebodes the devastation and reconstruction of our modern musical landscape. It's so refreshing in today's mess of musical superficiality to see a bunch of young guys get up on a stage and channel this kind of artistic energy amongst themselves. I applaud them for that.  Essential recording. Absolutely essential 
 Return To Forever was one of the original 3 greats (the other two being Weather Report and Mahavishnu Orchestra) in the 70's jazz/fusion era.  This album is superb in quality and texture, in that every song is a masterpiece brought to us from the genius of Chick Corea, who is the master of melodies and rythems.  An undying, untiring effort from 4 outstanding musicians, this is one of the essential albums to own, sitting along side greats such as The Beatles' White Album, Steely Dan's Royal Scam, and Led Zeppelin's Untitled (Four Symbols) 
 I highly recommend this book. I am a publisher by trade but this book can be used to jump start any small business by  providing the essential do's and dont's of publicity 
 This premier anthology of gay fiction features twenty stories by a diverse collection of new authors who all have one very special thing in common: their ability to shine a new light on upscale gay fiction.  In a collection rife with excellence, one is hard pressed to choose a favorite.  However, mention must be made of Michael Van Devere's short story "Manboobs", which is a comic collision of physical desire and psychological demand.  Van Devere's take on gym-obsessed urban America is spot-on.  His elusive creation of the title character Manboobs is not only riotous and real, but the narrator's growing lust of him spawns memories of Mary Shelly's Frankenstien.  Michael Van Devere is clearly an emerging writer who has the gifts that herald the beginning of a long career.  I have read and reread this anthology and can only say bravo to the editor and authors for revealing the highs and lows of the modern gay psyche.  
 Guillaume Apollinaire, Alcools (translated by Donald Revell)  (Wesleyan, 1995)  What is there to review about Alcools itself? It's Guillaume Apollinaire. It was published ninety years ago. It's one of the documents Tristan Tzara was reading obsessively while forming the dada movement, and thus was also a heavy influence on surrealism, and between the two was an influence on most modern writing. It contains some of Apollinaire's best-known poems. If you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for? It's a literary classic, and one that should be in every home.  What I'm reviewing here is Donald Revell's new translation of Alcools. I hadn't got the book out thinking that; I was planning to use this as a platform to mouth the same old words about the greatness of Apollinaire and how you should have all read him already, in high school if not before, and how horrible it is that our educational system doesn't teach the man. But then I read Revell's (thankfully brief; I hate fifty-page introductions to books of poetry in translation) intro to this, and I realized that at least writing, if not reading, this review would be more interesting than usual. For Revell talks about the poetic license he took with the original text in order to preserve the spirit of Guillaume Apollinaire, rather than be slavish to the original words.   For the most part, it works pretty well. Revell, after all, is a fantastic poet in his own right, and you can trust his judgment as to what sounds good and what doesn't. Those who know French (or even a smattering of French, or those capable of easily recognizing cognates) will be able to check the original text, on the facing page, and see differences pretty readily. One wonders whether the perceived strengths and weaknesses in this translation (as one must wonder with all translations) have more to do with the original translations of these poems a reader has read than with the original (because it's very rare to find a poem that translates literally and still sounds poetic in the new language). I cut my teeth on Apollinaire with the translations in The Poetry of Surrealism (mostly by Michael Hamburger, with a few contributions by other translators), and I've always thought of those as the definitive translations of the Apollinaire poems included in both volumes. "Zone," for example, sounds completely different in the two books; it keeps the same spirit, of course, but other things (the pace, specifically) come off completely differently.  In the end, it most likely comes down to the reader. For the newcomer to Apollinaire, you may get more enjoyment out of this book than the seasoned reader. Yet the seasoned reader will find a good deal of enjoyment here as well, and possibly much food for thought on the nature of translation, as well. ***  
 This is one of the best retellings of the bloody series of assaults on Boston that was the first pitched battle of the Revolution.  Ketchum, an experienced historian, author, and editor, has skillfully woven a tale that is rich in color, yet is accurate.  The author's sources are impeccable, and his research goes deep.  The only account of this battle that I believe is superior is that done by John Elting, The Battle of Bunker Hill.      Both sides are given their due, and you can actually picture yourself in the redoubt or along the rail fence, wiping sweaty palms and counting the rounds remaining in your cartridge box.  From the initial horror of young Asa Pollard's head being crushed by a bouncing cannon ball to the unbelievable three volleys fired by John Stark's militiamen to smash and slaughter the British light infantry companies along the beach the reader is given all but a ringside seat to the carnage.        The leaders of both sides from the calm, fearless Howe to the indefatigable Prescott in the redoubt are given life with Ketchum's pen bringing the noise, smoke, and horror to life.  One can almost feel the balls ripping into flesh as Captain Harris falls with a seemingly mortal wound to the head and admired Major Pitcairn being fatally wounded in sight of his officer-son.      The bottom line is: if it is written by Ketchum, you should not only read it, but have it in your collection.  All of his work is excellent, being both informative and colorful, as well as accurate 
 One of the editorial reviews calls this a "minor" work and I can see his point; it's a novella with small ambitions and it's defintely tawdry. (For me, that's a plus, having a weakness for that sort of thing.) However, that's not the reason I've read it dozens of times, and will continue rereading it. There's the description of the Tenderloin, which is lean and evocative; Vollman brings it to life the way Jimmy wants the whores' stories to revive Gloria. There's the compassion I have for Jimmy, who is the sort of stinking, addled drunk you'd walk by while holding your breath. But most of all - and I have no idea if it was intended - "Whores for Gloria" becomes this wonderful allegory for the process of writing a novel, if not being a novelist. Jimmy is so deluded that he goes to whores in search of their hair and their stories and their memories, all of which he thinks he can graft on to his memory (invented or not) of Gloria and make her real. It's the same game a novelist plays: there's an ideal vision that exists for reasons only he/she understands. To make it real on paper they have to become an obsessive collector of the world, stealing others' stories and blending them with their own imaginations. Such a strange, crazy-making hobby - and yet every novelist on Amazon.com has indulged in it, which is one more reason that Jimmy becomes a worthy subject. A terrific read(... 
 ...and just when I thought I was becoming a good skier, I read Andrew's book and realized the depth of technical skill he posses. The Chuting Gallery is an excellant tool to be used by accomplished ski mountaineers to  test the grade of their steel. As a guide book, for me, it tells me where  not to go.... 
 If you haven't bought this book, then you should get it now. Kenzaburo Oe is one of the few left wing writers in Japan who has made a great impact world wide. His style is original, his themes often poignant. His own personal suffering and the suffering of his own brain-damaged child often feature in his novels in subtle and not so subtle forms. You will not find any cliches in this novel and Oe is never nauseatingly sentimental. A true gem 
 Although a sole proprietor, I found Alpha Dogs to have great relevance to my own business.  I stayed up late at night, taking notes on all the advice I thought would be indispensible.  Ms. Fenn's writing style is wonderfully concise and lively.  I found the case study format to be much more engaging than anything didactic and the summaries at the end of each chapter make it easy to return again and again.  A great book for any entrepreneur, big or small, who aspires to be an alpha dog 
 The title says it all for this book.  My experience is that it's one of the more inarticulate, and one of the most eloquent books I've read.  Victor sources for us, throughout this book, the fullness of his being.  We come to know how he became tender and macho, brilliant and relatively uneducated, practical and spiritual, loving and enraged.  The family in which he grew up is a study in massive contradictions, fascinating in their extremes and essential to the development of the fine human being that Victor is.  One cannot ignore the rare glimpse this book gives into public education from the perspective of the unaccepted minority, learning disabled child 
 I am Caroline, My story starts the book on page 3. I am happy to see that this book continues to help people and continues to be used as a resource for Burn Survivors. Remember, One Day at A Time. . .you can do it!!! Wishing you continued success in your recoveries! Caroline 
 I read this to my 4 month old and he loves it.  It rhymes, has lots of onomatopoeia, and plenty of opportunities for adding sound effects and emotional expression 
 A helpful tool for students as well as teachers.  Each concept ceases to remain redundant 
 Enjoyed the book and can't wait to see the movie.  Lots of action - provocative. 
 PULSE is one of those rare thrillers that thrive in a low budget...and thrive well. Alot of the creepy going ons are hidden in shadows...and just out of the corner of your eye. Just when you least expect it, a chilling shadow will cross your screen...sometimes growing into an all out terror.  Scariest scene is when a guy goes into a room, there are large blood red stains on the wall behind him...and a shadow takes shape in front of him. Completely in terror...the guy stumbles backward over a couch and scurries behind it as the jerking shape moves towards him...reaching over the couch...   You won't shake thast scene for days it's that creepy.  Other things occur throughout the film...usually out of focus or in the background which add to the stifling claustrophobic atmosphere. In one instance, the camera is focused on a young girl pausing on the street. In the backgound way in the distance, you see a blurry figure climb a tower...and jump to it's death. This scene was extremely realistic, but not gory.  And that is where this film succeeds. No gore, but excellent atmosphere.  Alot of the conversations take place from a distance, so it is difficult to discern who the characters are, but for the clothes they are wearing. You cannot see thier faces.  PULSE was also remade by Americans and they, in my opinion, missed the creepy foreboding atmosphere and replaced it with Hollywood special effects, which compromised the whole concept of the film. Watch the Japanese version instead for chills and far better acting.  Also reccommended: The Ey 
 Wonderful poems showing the power and of two woman poets of the Heian Jidai.  Exposes the "nature" poetry prejudice that derives from the unfortunately all male cutesy pie abbreviations of Westernized haiku.  Waka yes, Haiku no 
 It is a very good book. It is concise in its explanations and the details are enough for someone who needs an anatomical view of the brain as opposed to a cellular or molecular approach. The pictures are fantastic. I use them for clarification all the time 
 That these records feature Charlie Christian may not be the most important reason for acquiring them.  That they represent a high point in capturing a few hours in the most important musical development in the 20th century (jazz) probably is.  Getting the feel of live performance in the studio is nororiously difficult.  It is managed here.  The actual sound quality is superb, and consistently so throughout these four discs.  The music represents a high point in the recording of jazz.  The participants represent some of the greatest past master bands - Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Count Basie - and point to the future in Lester Young and Charlie Christian.  Morevover some of the musicians are legends on their instruments - particular note must be made of Cootie Williams, Lionel Hampton,  Benny Carter, Harry James, Gene Krupa, Dave Tough, Jack Teagarden, and of course Mr Goodman himself. It was a felicitous set of circumstances which led to this music.  There was youth of course, foresight and generosity on Mr Goodman's part, love, innovation and experimentation, and a common dedication.  Very important was the inspiration that great musicians provide to each other, how they lift each other.  Nor should it be forgotten how Mr Goodman broke down racial barriers when it took real courage to do so.  Respect for him from all musicians must be a factor in this music before you.It is worthwhile to listen to this music once just focussing on Mr Hampton.  Again focussing on Mr Christian.  Again focussing on Mr Goodman.  But take AS LONG AS YOU LIVE as an instance, on CD 2 Track 11.  It begins with the chalumeau repetition of one note by the leader  and an opening solo by Mr Basie on piano followed  by Cootie Williams providing a sweetly muted solo on trumpet.  There is a brief interlude by Mr Christian on guitar then a solo by Georgie Auld on tenor.  The solo by Mr Goodman which follows is enough to bring tears to you eyes in its sweetness and light.  The piece closes with chalumeau figure repeated.  A lovely performance.  This is followed by BENNY'S BUGLE which grooves beyond belief - democratically it is Mr Auld's moment to provide the main solo.  This is a feature of all this music - no one musician hogs the limelight.  It is never just a feature for one or the other.  This is part of  the genius of Mr Goodman.  On his instrument, in this music, he has no parallel.  Sometimes he gets so fiery he heads into the territory of Edmond Hall, other times his clarinet just smiles.  Although I have favourites of Mr Goodman's such as  the trio playing for THE FLETCHER HENDERSON FUND c1953, these four CD's featuring Mr Christian are now my favourite Goodman records.  They are so rich in content, that I can only listen to perhaps half an hour at a time.  Nor is there a moment on them I would delete, including false starts, and alternate takes.  This is a case where rhythm(or swing) is given some of its most delightful moments in all music taking its rightful place alongside harmony and melody.  Of all my music, these four CD's take there place among my favourites such as KIND OF BLUE, AT THE BLUE NOTE (Keith Jarrett), THE WILDFLOWER SESSIONS,  MONK on RIVERSIDE, THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION (Coltrane) 
 very easy to read and follow, exellent summary of the essential facts and good practice questions good for preparing of any postgraduate exams in physiology highly recommended 
 This book not only gives a description of the different types of teas, it tells how they are processed from the same plant to make the different teas and the history of tea from China to India, to Japan, to Europe, to America. There is a whole section on terminology used for herbal teas, how to grow, cultivate, harvest, dry and store them. One section talks about the utensils used to brew a cup of tea, while another section talks about what herbs are used for what medical condition.  What sets this book apart from other herbal tea books is how the individual herbs have subtitled sections for description & parts used, historical notes, scientific findings, traditional use,  and considerations. It even has the pronunciation listed 
 A thoroughly enjoyable reading experience, this book expands on what Feynman wrote in "Adventures of a Curious Character" (ACC), although this book stands alone (you need not have read the first). Feynman, in his characteristic, modest and endearing style engages the reader page after page. He expands details mentioned in ACC as well as introducing new, and just as engaging, material. His light-hearted approach to serious matters and his expression of insatiable lust for knowledge in an enjoyable style makes this book a pleasure to read. I find it hard to fault this book and page after page it kept me wanting to read more. Reading the book makes you want to go out and satisfy all those childhood curiosities that, unfortunately, some of us lose in adult life. I read the book at night and found myself constantly wanting to go outside and look for frogs, insects and other wonders of the natural world. If I did have to find fault in the book, it would only be that it kept me up later at night than usual--a great book, by a great man 
 The Complete Guide to Walking is everthing you need to get started with (or to get better at) a walking program. Mark Fenton covers just about every topic you can think of asking about, from beginning to advanced programs, gearing up for walks, and treadmills, to stretching, nutrition, strength training, and getting you motivated and enthusiastic about walking. His easy writing style, his humor and enthusiasm go a long way to get you off the couch and out the door to enjoy all the pleasures of a good walk. The book itself is beautifully laid out with many color photos, interesting sidebars and stories, and a one-year log incorporated into the book to help you along. The resource list is comprehensive, with clubs, apparel, gear manufacturers, strollers, and walkable-community information. I am using this book as my guide for weight loss and better health, and give it my highest recommendation. If you've never been able to get with any kind of physical activity consistently, this is the book that will help you do it 
 An excellent fast read that kept me spellbound in one three and a half hour sitting. How fitting for Franklin's 300th birthday. He would probably be pleased with the whole work--especially his professional historian friend R's contribution to his reputation as well as that of another neglected Founding Father--James Madison that I wish more had been made of.  
  I've dealt with all other kinds of pocket notebooks, all of which fold, deform, get pages easily folded over and ripped out and stained. The Moleskine is an elegant little solution that protects itself with a thin, unobtrusive cover and a small elastic strap which has avoided every other problem that's plagued previous notebooks. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive 
 My son John was diagnosed borderline autism.  To me that was enough.  I picked this book up within a week of the diagnois and to say that it helped me cope and be strong for my son is an understatement.  While I was in the middle of reading chapter three, we began ABA therapy and within weeks saw major improvements.  Lynn did an amazing job of being straightforward and unbiased to all treatments.  I recommend this book for everyone with a child who is borderline or falls completely under the category of pdd 
 This is a very good biography of Michelangelo that ranks along with Irving Stone's "The Agony and the Ecstasy" (fictional bio).  Bull includes numerous letters to and from Michelangelo that involve friends and family.  One is left with a good overall picture of Michelangelo and his times.  I would have given it 5 stars if Bull was a little more inquisitve about painting and how painters of the time went about their work (including Michelangelo) 
 "The Shadows of Power" is a very enlightening and astounding book.  Perloff does a fantastic job of exposing the truth of the Council on Foreign Relations by making very good logical arguments and backing them up with many facts.  This brief book covers many United States domestic and international affairs in the twentieth century and only scratches the surface.  Volumes of books about scandal and corruption could be composed for each chapter of the book.  Although the conclusion may at first appear outlandish, I am convinced that our government is being ruled by a select all-powerful few.  The minorities of people who read this book and are not compelled obviously don't want to believe it or they are living under "The Media Blackout" and won't believe the truth of it until it may possibly be too late.  This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in politics.  It shows that whether our nation is controlled by Democrats or Republicans the same policies and ideals of the CFR will be enacted and enforced.    This fabulous book must be read by all liberty and freedom loving people! 
 I am a big fan of Terrence's films and also Horner's previous work on film scores.  While I can understand some of the frustration with this soundtrack, I would certainly not say it is a waste.  The film is beautiful and so is Horner's music.  Tracks such as "A Flame Within" and "Of the Forest" continue, after months of listening, to take my breath away.  This is a worthwhile one to pick up, especially if you are a fan of James Horner. Like Terrence's film, the music transports you to another world, that is, if you let it.  
 I love this book.  It has provided invaluable information for me about myself and changes I'm experiencing.  Don't hesitate to buy it and share it with other women 
 As a person who understands that science is based on data, not stories of travel to Alaska or Greenland, I found MELTDOWN to be an informative and provocative book on Global Warming (GW). Instead of taking high-profile junkets around the world in search of dramatic stories of GW disasters, Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, Research Professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia, bases his analysis in MELDOWN on the examination of a massive amount of data. Unlike charlatans like Tim Flanhery, Al Gore, and especially the scientifically-challenged Elizabeth Kolbert, Dr. Michaels has the skills and patience to perform this challenging and important analysis.   In MELTDOWN Dr. Michaels shows that GW is a theory that is extremely short of supportive data. Almost all climatologists agree that the Earth has been warming for the last 150-200 years as it emerged from the Little Ice Age. They agree on little else. They disagree on the recent temperature trend of the Earth: increasing, leveling off, or decreasing. They disagree on the relationship of carbon dioxide to GW: most of the warming took place before 1970 when levels of this gas were lower. They disagree on the reconstruction of the climate of the Earth during the last 1000 years. (However a  National Academy of Science report issued in June concludes that we can say very little about the average temperature of the Earth prior to 1600 AD. No more statements that this year is the warmest year in the last 1000 years.) And, they disagree on the ability of mathematical models to predict future global temperatures.  Don't get me wrong; I don't agree with everything Dr. Michaels writes in MELTDOWN and I find it hard to see the trends he sees in many graphs. However, I appreciate his effort to write a candid, fact-based book on global warming (GW). Dr. Michaels has the statistical and research skills to do so unlike many charlatans in the field.   However, one should not get the impression that MELTDOWN is a dull book. Dr. Michaels has a dry wit and is a teller of many interesting tales. One of Dr. Michael's best tales is the  "extinction" of the fresh water Palau golden jellyfish attributed to its lake's increase in temperatue because of the strong El Nino of 1997-1998 which obviously was caused by GW. The government of Palau and environmentalist everywhere solemnly intoned that GW wiped out this rare and beautiful species and that we were next. However, when the lake's temperature returned to normal, the golden jellyfish returned. So, the lowly Palau Golden Jellyfish found a way to survive when the best GW minds couldn't. It seems a lot of GW advocates came away from this affair with egg on their face, or perhaps more accurately jellyfish.  I note that Dr. Michaels is accused of being a member of the "Great Exxon Conspiracy," since he is associated with the Cato Institute which is alleged to receive money from energy interests. However, since most climatologist suckle at the teats of the UN and EPA, it is good to have someone who feeds elsewhere. I also note that almost all the negative reviews are written by people who obviously have not read his book. Too bad. If they understood anything about science they might learn something from MELTDOWN.  If you like science--read MELTDOWN. If you are a cynic concerning GW--read MELTDOWN. If you are open minded about GW--read MELTDOWN. If you think the book or movie "An Inconvienent Truth" is good science--don't bother. You are beyond help.  As for me, I'm having shirts printed with an image of the Palau golden jellyfish and the caption "Part of the Great Exxon Conspiracy!"  ----------------------------------------JSP--7/2/2006------------------------------------- 
 Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all.  The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series.  My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them.  Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time.  This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues.  I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly. 
 ta bueno de verdad yo no soy un fanatico de Tito Nieves pero este cd me fascina ademas es mi primer disco de el.  Al igul que la India, Tito incluyo reggaeton en este cd eso no le resto puntos musicalmete, los arreglos estanpor la mazeta este un disco bien bailable pa los salseros ademas incluye dos baladas al igual que reggaeton y un salsaton.  Mis canciones favoritas son aunque todas son buenas terremoto(reggaeton),si yo fuera el(dos versiones),esa boquita y la mejor de toas Todvia no se ha escrito. Lo tengo quemao.   
 This is one of the best books I have purchased as a beginning miniaturist ever.  It covers the "nuts to bolts" on how to create just about everything in the bedroom and bath...my only regret...I haven't found a book for the other rooms!  I would recommend this book to anyone from the beginner to the pro's 
 Those of you who enjoy the seperation of sound from a 5.1 surround sound setup with dvd-audio capability will really enjoy this disc.  The swoosh sounds of the air poles seem to bounce around the room with you right in the middle of the action.  I own the Complex rock tour dvd and enjoy listening and watching to it, but this recording makes better use of the surround channels to really envelop you in whats going on 
 After spending a good hour playing with Anastasia's eyebrow colors at Sephora, I decided to give it a go and bought the Brunette ex-press kit. The colors are a bit dark for my golden, med brown hair, but if you go lightly, it looks better. I had bought her tweezers a month before and could not stop raving about how great there were compared to my tweezermans. So, her signature eyebrows color had to be just as good or at least almost as good as the real thing (Anastasia, herself). The Stencils were intimidating at first, I had to take a deep breath before plucking the hair outside the stencil outline. But once I was done, my eyebrows looked great! Like a mini-eyebrow lift; couldn't believe how much removing hairs from my already sparse eyebrows, could look better. Worth the buy 
 These exercises have been great for my back, neck, & shoulder pain. I was considering going to see a chiropracter, but since I've been using this Pilates video I no longer feel the need. I highly recommend this to everyone 
 While this book is rather dry at parts, if you're truly interested in making the most of your money, you'll benefit from its insight. There are several things I keep in the back of my mind whenever I'm tempted to overspend: most millionaires drive regular cars, not new, fancy ones; and most don't live extravagantly, they work hard, spend wisely and let the majority of their money grow. Essentially, most millionaires live like middle class folk, they just know how to live within their means 
 I own two ibiza mixes that were probably from 99 ' or so. They are some of my favorite music. I recently searched the term 'ibiza' and found more good electronic music with that term than i have ever. This mix has a good balance between authentic (not cheezy) melodies and rich sound design (watery bass and 303, and electo synth) , uplifting bass (but not too predictable),  as well as energetic with vocal hooks that are slightly clubby but hold it all together with the human element that makes me percieve the music in waves of ecstacy. 
 i've watched this one three times and i still don't know if i got it. i do know it's a cool film. maybe it's cool if you don't get every little thing about art, that you get only the things you want to get from it. i'm still wondering what does the statue of jesus christ carried around by a helicopter around rome symbolizes or the wild parties that spring up at different parts of the movie. the language fluctuates between italian and english. when i watch foreign films, i usually follow the subtitles rather than listen to the dialogue; i understand most of the film that way. maybe fellini was trying to convey a mood more than a message? all of the women in this movie are hot. especially anita ekberg. my favorite scenes with her are when she's in the tower in the church and her little black hat flies off into the sky and all she and marcello do is laugh like children and of course, the famous scene when she climbs into the fountain. now, that is a woman... marcello mastroianni exudes cool. he has the prescence and star quality of marlon brando. he is to fellini what deniro is to scorscese: his mouthpiece to express his ideas...i saw 8.5 when i was in college and now i've seen this. even if you only saw those two fellini movies, they would suffice... 
 Para Gadamer, la temporalidad de la tradición es absolutamente necesaria para la hermenéutica y de esta manera, la superación de la tradición es vista como una transformación de la tradición: "En nuestro comportamiento respecto al pasado, que estamos confirmando constantemente, la actitud real no es la distancia ni la libertad respecto a lo transmitido. Por el contrario, nos encontramos siempre en tradiciones, y éste nuestro pensar dentro de ellas no es un comportamiento objetivador que pensara como extraño o ajeno lo que dice la tradición; ésta es siempre más bien algo propio, ejemplar o aborrecible, es un reconocerse en el que para nuestro juicio histórico posterior no se aprecia apenas conocimiento, sino un imperceptible ir transformándose al paso de la misma tradición."     La "historia efectual" (wirkliche Historie) o los efectos del pasado en el presente más allá de lo sabido científicamente, es la transformación vital del sujeto histórico, pero desde el interior de la tradición: "La experiencia hermenéutica tiene que ver con la tradición. Es ésta la que tiene que acceder a la experiencia.  Sin embargo, la tradición no es un simple acontecer que pudiera conocerse y dominarse por la experiencia, sino que es lenguaje..." .  Aquí Gadamer hace referencia a que, precisamente, el medio de la experiencia hermenéutica es el lenguaje y por tanto interpretable, pero los límites de la interpretación que, de alguna manera, constituyen la ética de la investigación, es tomar en cuenta los prejuicios históricos y la autoridad de la tradición que en Gadamer quedan rehabilitados, es "la resolución entre oposición abstracta entre tradición e investigación histórica, entre historia y conocimiento de la misma".  Es decir, la interpretación histórica se debe efectuar dentro de la tradición que no está fundada sobre una autoridad coercitiva sino de conocimiento:  "Este sentido rectamente entendido de autoridad no tiene nada que ver con una obediencia ciega de comando.  En realidad no tiene nada que ver con obediencia sino con conocimiento."  Es decir, Gadamer implica que la autoridad de la tradición, lo mismo que el concepto de historia, se constituye no por la lucha entre diferentes discursos pasados sino por el conocimiento. Ahora bien, el problema es si el conocimiento dado por la tradición está in situ en el pasado o si no es algo construido en su poshistoria.  Los contenidos de autoridad de la tradición son dados a posteriori y Gadamer, me parece, hace abstracción de las relaciones de poder que están inherentes a los prejuicios.  La crítica que hace a la concepción de prejuicio a la Ilustración es que ésta separa absolutamente razón y tradición no viendo precisamente que la tradición y la autoridad también son racionales. La rehabilitación del prejuicio es que éste precisamente es el principio de comprensión del receptor:  "La moderna investigación histórica tampoco es sólo investigación, sino en parte también mediación de la tradición."  
 The American mythos of being a land where dreams come true is paradoxically shattered and bolstered in Ragtime by E.L. Doctorow. In fact, reading the book is like entering the magic of dreams -- a mystical and surreal land where life is beautiful and cruel and heaped with absurd correspondences that carry eerie significance.  In Doctorow's early 1900s, the lives of everyday fictional people such as a wealthy white family, a poor Jewish immigrant family, and a black family broken before it can form, flow freely into the experiences of historical figures such as the radical anarchist  Emma Goldman, Gibson Girl Evelyn Nesbit, magician Harry Houdini, financier J.P Morgan, automobile manufacturer Henry Ford, architect Stanford White, psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and General Tom Thumb, to name just a few. These imagined interactions have lasting effects on everyone involved. Goldman brings the numb and much-abused body of the Gibson Girl Nesbit to life with matronly care by rubbing the girl's confined muscles with liniment. The young white child, referred to only as "little boy," has a chance meeting with the famed Harry Houdini and finds himself compelled to call out to him "Warn the duke," which many years only later holds meaning for Houdini, and  also for all of us, since it refers to the shooting of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Jung, while traveling with Freud in New York City, meets the eyes of the immigrant "little girl," and experiences a "shock of recognition." All lives brush against each other, sometimes in tragedy or horror, sometimes in kindness or beauty, and often with humor. Visit www.lit-week.com for more on Ragtime 
 I just "discovered" Jane Wyman a couple of weeks ago when I saw "All that Heaven Allows," another Wyman triumph.  In "Johnny Belinda" she plays a lonely deaf woman who has never learned a way to communicate with the world.  Then, along comes a lonely doctor who makes it his business to teach her. Of course, none of this goes unnoticed by the small town residents that surround them. The story is engrossing and moving, but really the film is worth watching for Wyman's wordless performance alone--she's really one of the best. Don't know how I avoided seeing her all these years but I sure plan on checking out any of her movies I can get ahold of.  Also, Agnes Moorehead (who apparently made quite a few films with Wyman) gives another spectacular performance as Wyman's spinster aunt 
 William Mcneill presents a different and mind-expanding take on disease: microbes, humans, and governments all function similarly to facilitate their optimal survival and expansion.  When the opportunistic structure gets too greedy, it may overwhelm the host.  With time and familiarity, host and parasite usually come to an uneasy alliance, which allows the survival of each.  If you read "Plagues and Peoples" with this thesis in mind, it is a very interesting book.  If you lose sight of the thesis, it is too easy to get bogged down in the author's extremely baroque writing style.  A few reviewers concluded that the book was hard for them to comprehend because they were high school aged readers.  As an older adult, compulsive reader, with a lot of patience, I have to say I experienced the same problem with this book.  I checked the biographical material on the author to see if English was his second language.  I felt the book read as if translated.  I found myself mentally simplifying almost every sentence, not because of the complexity of the idea being conveyed, but because of unnecessary verbage.  "Plagues and Peoples" does contain loads information on the history of mankind and disease, within the framework of an interesting thesis.  I just feel that simpler wording would have helped the book read smoother. Another very fascinating history of man's interaction with microbes which is much more reader friendly is "Men and Microbes".    
 I was reluctant to buy this book based on the first reviews I read.  However, I have been daytrading for four years now, and frequently go against the crowd.  Perhaps it is this contrarian view that keeps me in this business.  I manage a proprietary firm in Denver (Bright Trading) and recommend this to ALL the new traders as well as veterans of the craft.  It is fresh, insightful and really gets to the meat of what makes one trader successful while another fails. A great companion to this book is Mark Douglas' book Trading In The Zone 
 This beautifully written book won the 2003 Victor Turner Prize for Ethnographic Writing, a big deal in US anthropology. When you read it you can see why, as it really succeeds in bringing this fascinating region to life. It is lyrically written, and often both funny and sad. It is very personal in its account of the author's experience in the Amazon and of the people that he knows there, and it is also very informative about the region's history and culture. A quote on the book rightly says that "it has a great deal to offer those knowing everything or nothing about the Amazon." I agree: Highly recommended 
 Well, you can easily imagine just how many cowardly white males will pretend to admire this book while actually thinking, in their confused little minds, that the ideas in this book will simply go away - not so! This is an excellent book that challenges white male assumptions, and points towards a better future for Women. It may seem strange that there are still a few Women who claim not to sympathize with Feminists even after all we've done for them. But in fact, Women, irregardless of class or race, are challenging patriarchy. A recent poll showed that a slight majority of Women who earn $125,000 dollars or more in this society are now Democrats or, more importantly, further to the Left. Because Women are challenging sexist assumptions about the way they are "supposed" to look, it is now conservative women who are helping to preserve the Barbie Doll mentality; a conservative Woman who attempts to exhibit sexuality is simply enforcing oppressive codes against all Women, including themselves. The conservative Woman lacks the intellect and empathy to lead other Women, even if she went to an elite school - and most smart Women are feminists of course! By holding back Women from empowerment, conservative Women are sometimes described by the old white male sexist term of Barbie Doll. One would think that if a Martian landed on the earth and observed which political affiliation it was in the best interests for a Woman to have, she would choose Feminism without pause - it's a no-brainer. A conservative Woman who is conventionally "attractive", and who attends an elite university, is still a Barbie Doll, make no mistake 
 The book, The Actor and the Text, by Cicely Berry, is an excellent book which opens actors up to the idea of studying the text of the play rather than the action.  Ms.Berry's book specifically focuses on the text of  William Shakespeare's plays.  She gives detailed examples of exercises that  can be very useful to actors attempting to decipher the language of  Shakespeare.  Personally as an actor, I found this book to be extremely  helpful not only for Shakespeare, but for all plays.  The book really made  me look at plays entirely differently.  In the past when first reading a  play, I would simply read through it and think about where my character  starts out in the beginning of the play and where he would end up at the  end of the play.  When I read a play now I really pay a lot more attention  to the words and the language that the author chose.  Once again, Cicely  Berry's book is an excellent reference for all actors who are looking to  make a personal improvement towards their acting skills and also their  interpretation of language 
 There is nothing like "Old School.recording Artist to make a play to renew real music 
 This is the best price I found for my second Rechargeable battery for my Nikon Coolpix 5200. It's perfect, and so nice to have a second battery!!! It was shipped so fast, I received it within a few days 
 I have not yet received this book from Amazon, so it is a little difficult to say what it is like. But I am sure it will be at least very good.  Runciman is an excellent author. 
 I am a Mexican woman studying in the USA.  I read a commentary above saying that these are European houses, they are not. We were conquered by the Spaniards centuries ago and thus the architectural style blended creating a "Mexican Style". This so called Mexican style includes european traces with Indian influences. This book represents Mexican houses that complies with this style. Obviously you can find native houses following Indian design, but for sure not in any  Mexican metropoli 
 This book is about a boy who goes into the hospital for a one night stay after an ear operation.  The pictures and words are bright, cheery and comforting to young readers.  My daughter liked to read this book even  after her hospital stay.  It was written in England so it shows hospital  scenes (like children in group wards) which didn't apply to my daughters  stay.  I pointed out differences between what would and did happen to her.   A good book to show a very young child what going to the hospital will be  like and that it isn't as scary as it might seem 
 This is one of two books I read while I was visiting Afghanistan. I found the book to be very educational and of great worth.  The lack of a "american-centric" point of view is one of the reasons why I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in Afghanistan 
 I LOVE THE ROLLING STONES.EACH AND EVER ALBUM MADE BY THEM IS A CLASSIC.SATISFACTION AND BROWN SUGAR ARE TWO OF THE FINEST SONGS EVER WRITTEN.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
 Too often, Hollywood directors seem to forget that cinematic success comes in the form of great characters.  Doc Hollywood, though, is one of those films that proves the rule.  This movie is chock full of great characters, even in some of the smallest of roles - and it's not just the people, for the small town in which the story takes place is quite a character unto itself.  The town of Grady is sort of an updated version of Mayberry - idyllic, of course, but nonetheless charming and evocative.  It's the kind of place you can only find in the South.  Of course, Dr. Ben Stone (Michael J. Fox) has blinders on when he first arrives.  Having just left the hustle and bustle (and blood) of a large D.C. hospital, he's on his way to La La Land in hopes of snagging a cushy job in the lucrative practice of cosmetic surgery.  On his cross-country drive, he gets as far as South Carolina before fate steps in, leaving Stone temporarily stuck in the small town of Grady with a banged-up sports car and a judge's sentence of thirty-two hours of community medical service.  Grady is in great need of a new doctor to replace the aging Dr. Hogue (Barnard Hughes), and everyone in town (well, almost everyone) - from the mayor (David Ogden Stiers) to the official welcoming committee of ladies and on down to the local farmers - makes no bones about their hopes of enticing him to stay.  Even the glory of the annual squash festival can't do much to equal the scales, though, as California promises fortune and excitement, while a practice in Grady promises only a barely decent salary and quiet, country living.  Predictably, though, Stone finds love - or at least the prospect for love - with the local ambulance driver.  He and Lou (Julie Warner), a single mother and aspiring law student, engage in a lot of mutual flirtation, but she quickly becomes something much more than a mere conquest for Stone, which makes his decision whether to stay in Grady or snatch the gold ring in California much more difficult than he ever would have thought.  With the help of a fantastic cast, Grady quickly begins to feel a lot like home for the viewer.  With just a little interaction here and there, you really come to know a vast number of people - the mayor, the local mechanic, the judge, old Doc Hogue, the implacable Nurse Packer, the illiterate family who depends on the doc to read them the family letters they receive, and the list just goes on.  Two of the faces are particularly recognizable: Woody Harrelson plays Lou's would-be suitor, and Bridget Fonda (whom I have long adored, despite the fact that she's a Fonda) plays the mayor's daughter, a young lady who longs for the bright lights of a big city.  David Ogden Stiers, I have to say, is just wonderful as the mayor; he's the exact antithesis of the Bostonian intellectual he played for so many years on M*A*S*H.  I can't say that all of these actors and actresses sounded all that Southern, but it's not their fault that they weren't lucky enough to be born here in the South.  You might be thinking this sounds like just another story about a city slicker won over by the charms of small-town living.  Doc Hollywood could easily have been just another boring version of an old story, but this film has a special quality that turns it into so much more than a predictable comedy.  Thanks to nuanced directing, rich storytelling, and wonderful acting, more than a few of these characters have a remarkable depth that you pick up on very quickly.  Grady isn't just a town; it's a way of life, with a genuineness you don't often find in any kind of film.  Stone's ultimate decision does not come down to anything as simple as romance vs. money.  Certainly, his feelings for Lou are deep and genuine, but the town of Grady and all of her citizens sing a siren song of love that Stone hears, as well.  As for that ending, it doesn't play out exactly in the manner you might expect, and that's just one more reason to love this wonderful movie 
 The Reluctant Spiritualist is non-fiction but reads like a fast-paced whodunit. The mystery is whether spiritualism is a fact, or a fraud cooked up by two bored teenage girls in a farmhouse in mid-nineteenth century upstate New York.  Drawing extensively on diaries, correspondence, and literature of the times, Nancy Rubin Stuart paints a vivid portrait of the meteoric rise and tragic downfall of Maggie and Katy Fox, women who gave birth to the modern spiritualist movement. It all began when the sisters learned to dislocate the joints of their big toes to produce "rapping" sounds in order to frighten their high-strung mother. Over the years, Maggie and Katy become so popular that they hold seances for world leaders.   Much of what Ms. Stuart documents is clearly fraud, but other instances of the sisters' powers, and that of other, mostly female "mediums", are inexplicable. Politicians and celebrites who were skeptics become converts, even while many crusade to expose trickery in the business.  This was one of the few occupations where Victorian women influenced society in large numbers, and Ms. Stuart does a good job of exploring spiritualism's sexual overtones. Many famous gentlemen attended seances held by Maggie and Katy because they were attracted to them. One humorous incident involved a bunch of drunken U.S. senators in a hotel room with the two young women. Things haven't changed much in the last 150 years!  Against this backdrop is a poignant, star-crossed love story involving Maggie and the great Arctic explorer Elisha Kent Kane. Kane is a firm non-believer who gets Maggie to give up rapping, at least for a while.  To the end, Ms. Stuart takes no position on the validity of spiritualism, presenting extensive evidence, pro and con, down to our own time. Some critics have said that the author's even-handedness detracts from her work. I consider her impartiality a strength. It is best to let the reader make up his or her own mind about a subject that defies empirical proof. The Reluctant Spiritualist is an important book that raises hard questions about the immortality of the soul 
 Some horror movies are meant to scare the pants off of you. Some horror movies try to scare the pants off of you, and other horror movies realize they really have no hope of scaring the pants off of you, and just try to be a fun movie. Chopping Mall is one of those movies.   I always look for three things in a slaher/horror movie. One, is the acting up to par, and is the movie well made? Secondly, are the death sequences cool, and believable? Lastly, does the ending deliever?   Chopping mall does well in the first category. It is fun, has that cool 80's mall feel to it and the actors do a rather good job. The "cool guy" of the movie chews gum like a cow chewing cud, so you're not to upset when he goes. The other actors all do a great job of running, screaming and coming up with ways to destroy the robots. The robots do an excellent job of scooting around and dispelling intruders with their lasers and tazers. (Their laser sound is right out of the original War of the Worlds movie)  Chopping mall, chops up the death sequences into cool and believable bits. This movie has one of the coolest sequences ever, when the blond bombshell, (I'd go into the mall and buy her a pack of cigs too...) loses her head, when running away from the "bots". I watched it in slow motion to see how they did it but I can't figure it out. The rest of them are pretty traditional deaths, but they are all believeable and unique.  The last part of the horror movie for me is the ending. Chopping mall ends pretty well. It's pretty exciting, and fairly tense, believeable and it wraps up the story of the movie.  This movie isn't one you want to watch to be terrified. This is a movie you watch with a bunch of friends, make fun of, laugh at and generally have a good time. It entertains, and brings a cheesy smile to your face. If you like cheesy movies, and are looking for some to add to your collection, then purchase this one. 
 I've just finished reading it to my 6 and 8 year olds.  "Read, read," they roared when I threatened to stop and put them to bed.  With some of the narrative drive of Raold Dahl, Pullman leavens his darkness with a brilliant combination of cheeky humor, self-satire, post modern machinations all set in a Dickensian London.  My only complaint: the kids were so excited they couldn't fall asleep.  Me too 
 SCORPION is a stay up all night thriller that moves from Trinidad in the Southern Caribbean to South Texas, to Venezuela and back to Trinidad and you can feel the heat and humidity of those places as you read. Mr. Stewart puts you right into the action as you move through the pages, so when you join DEA agent Bill Broxton as he tries to stop an assassin, be prepared for some serious escape time.  DEA agent Bill Broxton has been assigned to protect the Prime Minister of Trinidad from the Scorpion, an assassin hired by the Salizar drug cartel, because his girlfriend Dani, who he soon hopes to make his bride, is the daughter of the American Ambassador. It's because Broxton is so close to the ambassador that makes him perfect for the assignment, as the Prime Minister has refused American help, instead turning to his own Justice Minister for security.  So Broxton is supposed to use his connection with ambassador to get close to the PM, however Dani isn't as pure as the driven snow. Broxton may be carrying a torch in his heart and a ring in his pocket, but she's been carrying an assassin's guns and playing the field. She is the Scorpion who has been hired to take out Broxton's charge. And who is she working for? None other than the justice minister in charge of keeping the P.M. safe.  SCORPION has it all, foreign intrigue, deadly bad guys, a good guy in over his head, romance, terrific chase scenes and best of all, an ending you'll never see coming. I couldn't put this one down and I don't think you will be able to either 
 I say okay because it does have all the foundations of learning how to trade options, but you need to still do your research to profit.  If you just read the first 4-5 Chapters it basically sums it up and you get what you need out of it.  The rest of the book goes more into detail on in the money and out of the money and naked calls which is for a more advanced trader.  Remember to paper trade!  It will save your savings account.  After reading this book I suggest you read The Disciplined Trader 
 This book chronicles one of the pivotal events of the 19th century; growth of the opium trade into China and the ensuing Opium wars between China and the West; the latter being primarily England.  Starting with initial introductions in the late 1700s, the book concentrates on the events fro 1830s - 1860s when most of the action took place.  This action consisted of diplomatic chess matches between Chinese and Western representatives, debates in England's Parliament about the opium trade, battles along the Chinese coast between English warships and local junks, the Taiping uprising in China, smuggling, bribery, backstabbing, and the ransacking of cities.    This book is full of many themes.  First and foremost is the theme that an industrialized country cannot be matched in terms of raw power and ability to project that power around the world.  China was the oldest of civilizations, and even though it was materially self-sufficient and had the world's largest population; it was no match for the English.  Second, if the Chinese had dealt earnestly and on equal terms with the foreigners from the get-go; much of the hostility and hatred on the part of the British might have been mitigated later on.  Third, drug addictions and trade can and do drive government policies.  It drove the foreign policy of China and England for much of the 19th century.  Fourth, money talks, not morals.  One of the substories told in this book is the conversion of W.E. Gladstone, that career English Parliamentarian, from anti-opium to pro-opium.  Last, insularity do not last long in a world of global trade.  Try they might to stave of the English and their opium, but as long as China had tea, and locals on both sides were willing to trade, the Chinese government would eventually fail in its fight against opium and the outsiders.    This is a good book; the story it tells is important in understanding the history of Chinese - Western relations.  Many important events apart from the opium trade are covered; such as the growth of the coolie trade, the transfer of Hong Kong from China to England, the growth of a Western presence on Formosa, and France's initial steps into Indo-China.  There are several minuses of this book.  First is the language of the text.  The book was written in the 1970's, but the grammar and wording seem to reflect the time of the events themselves.  Terms are used to describe battles, dialogue, and government intrigue that would baffle most lay readers.  Second, for a book that involves a lot of geography, there is a paucity of maps.  This considering that many of the Chinese places mentioned in the book go by different names now.  But overall, a good history book and a great story 
 Excellent, quality latin music with a NY flavor. Some of the tracks can't be labeled as contemporary or classic (possibly standard). The CD reaches a peak with track # 14, Preciosa, which begins melodically with great lyrical content then, after about 3 minutes, explodes with emotion & power 
 I have been a fan of Kerr since I was a teenager.  I adore her books and her writing.  I love the way she does interweave the lifetimes together.  Very refreshing.    The main reason I wanted to review this book was in response to a comment stating that they did not understand why Nevyn was punished so harshly for such a paltry sin.  I think they misunderstood.  He is not being punished, he made a vow.  He vowed to bring Brangwen to the dweomar, no matter how long it took.  The gods of Wyrd accepted his vow and granted him an unusually long life to see it through.  I think if people took the time to actually read and not skim, they might actually understand what is going on and be able to enjoy it 
 Perhaps the first of the social injustice movies Hollywood began turning out in the late Forties, Crossfire is one of the few in my opinion which still hold up. That's because the social message, against hate in general and anti-Semitism in particular, doesn't become too preachy and get in the way of the story. Unlike Gentleman's Agreement (anti-Semitism), Boomerang (legal and class injustice), Pinky (racial prejudice) and others, Crossfire tells a taut story first, in this case about a murder, and features some first-rate acting, especially from Robert Ryan.  The murder mystery is straightforward and there's little doubt about who the killer is. We know a man named Samuels (Sam Levene) has been beaten to death. We know the suspect, Corporal Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) is one of four recently discharged soldiers who met him in a bar. We know one of the four is a big, edgy guy, Sergeant Montgomery (Robert Ryan), who laughs too much and likes to verbally poke at people he thinks are weak. The body is discovered, evidence points to Mitchell as the killer and police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) goes to work. One of Mitchell's buddies, Sergeant Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) doesn't think Mitchell could be a killer. In a cautious way he starts working with Finlay to establish an alibi for Mitchell, and then to concentrate on Montgomery. One of the biggest issues is what could Montgomery's motivation be. It turns out Montgomery doesn't like civilians, doesn't like "hillbillies," and hates Jews. He's a bigot. When Montgomery complains about "those kinds of guys", Finlay asks, "What kind of guys?"  "You know the kind." Montgomery says. "Played it safe during the war, keepin' themselves in civvies, nice apartments, swell dames...you know the kind."  "I'm not sure that I do."  "Some of 'em are named Samuels, some of 'em have funnier names." It isn't long before we realize that Montgomery is a psychopath who hates just about anyone who is different. With Keeley's help, Finlay finally is able to lay a clever trap for Montgomery.  Young does a fine job as the cop. He's seen probably too much. He's tired. He's a decent man who relies on his training. "I've been at this job too long," he tells Keeley. "I go about it the only way I know how. I collect all the facts possible...most of them are useless." Mitchum, laconic but alert, makes a nice partner for Finlay. He's ready to stand by a buddy he thinks is incapable of killing, and he really doesn't like Montgomery.  Robert Ryan makes you feel uncomfortable from the moment you see him. There's something too friendly about him, something too hidden, something too ready to explode. You're not surprised when he suddenly beats Samuels to death with his fists. The difference between the part of Keeley and the part of Montgomery is, I think, the difference between a role that can lead to a reputation as a movie star and a role that can lead to a reputation as a movie actor. I think it was only when Mitchum took on unsympathetic roles in Night of the Hunter and Cape Fear that many critics realized he was a first-rate film actor, not just a star. By that time, Ryan already had the actor reputation, but major stardom had eluded him.  In a smaller part, Gloria Grahame is excellent as a dance hall hostess who might give Mitchell an alibi. With her cat eyes and pouty lips, Grahame always was distinctive. She and Paul Kelly as a man who may or may not be her husband bring an uneasy and almost surreal quality to their scenes.  Crossfire is a solid looking noir. The DVD presentation is very good. 
 Betty Blue soundtrack stands well on its own, it's quite beautiful and atmospheric.  My one serious criticism is due to the excessive use of synthesizers.  It's been some time since I've seen the movie and I no longer remember how much is use of synthesizers in the function of the story.  However, I am certain that in most cases they were used as a mere substitution of real instruments, which could have been much more effective.  Perhaps that was due to the budgetary restrictions.  If so, they did a good job of hiding that element in any other aspect of the film production.  For instance, there's unpleasant synth to substitute string section and orchestra in Des orages pour la nuit, a harp-like synth in the background of the Cargo voyage, and particularly annoying synthetic bass in La poubelle couisine and Lisa Rock.  The information on the CD is scarce and for that reason certainly not rewarding for true audiophiles as there is no information about the musicians (nor about the film for that matter).  Is La poubelle couisine based on a folk melody or what? - there's no mention.  All that said, immoderate synthesizers cannot rob these songs of their beauty and they do not stand as much in the way as I've perhaps made it sound.  After all, the saxophone sound present throughout the CD is for real and in some songs synthesizers have been used with good measure, as in Chili con carne 
 If you liked Moore's earlier works (especially 'Soul Mates'), or you are entirely new to his writing..there is something of wisdom and insight for everyone in this magical volume. As is true of Moore's other, related books, they invite you to a smorgasboard of ideas, knowledge and observations. You can pick and choose, take or leave, as you like. Whilst some of his chapters are slightly 'academic', there are many aspects to his interpretations that have perfect relevance to, and resonance with our own, everyday experiences. 'Intimacy within intimacies'-this book is like the candle we hold to the dark window, as we wonder how we might feel less alone in this world. It is a guide only. However, worth the journey and the read. Even if, a little indulgence does certainly go a long way 
 Perry uses extensive interviews with former clerks and Justices to gather his data on the cert. process in the United States Supreme Court.  He presents the information in a very readable format that provides brings to  light why some cases get heard and others don't.  Ultimately he presents a  decision making model that takes into consideration both the individual  justices, the factors influencing cert., and the purpose of the Court.   This book gives the reader a good look at the cert. process from the inside  and from a non-legal perspective.  It is a must read for any attorney  thinking of writing a cert. petition.  This book would be interesting for  anyone interested in how the Supreme Court functions in our system of  government 
 I'm a big fan of Doug's methodology and books, so I'm biased.  I'm a fan because I know his process works... I've used it in a number of medical device projects.  In the area of safety critical or mission critical systems, you can't throw out requirments and process; it isn't an option.  I would argue that it is also not smart.    This book does a great job of explaining how to achieve the core ideals of agile without sacrificing the up-front work (requirements and modeling) that are necessary to achieve a high quality system within a reasonable schedule and cost.  I love the fact that the book harkens back to core software engineering principles and shows how this process enforces those principles while encouraging just the right amount of agility to react in a timely manner to mid-course corrections that every project (accept the very small) experience.  The book demonstrates an important aspect that I have used in my own projects; the core process is robust to the needs of different projects.  For example, adding a release plan for scheduling the implementation of individual or groups of use-cases or expanding use-cases using interaction design.  Extensibility is the mark of a solid, well thought-out core design; whether it be a process or software.  The approach was very balanced in light of the fact that Doug and Matt have been some of the most vocal detractors of the Agile/XP neuvo processes.  It takes someone from outside the religion to bring balance; they have done that with this book.  Their "sweet spot" is within reach!  Best 
 This book outlines all the best places to visit in Hawaii.  I've been a fan of Frommer's for quite some time, and this Hawaii guide is as good as the others 
 I would certainly agree with the reviewers who have said this is a great start for those who don't own any Sinatra albums.  I have recommended and/or purchased this particular CD for a number of friends and family members who were previously unaware of the genius of the Chairman of the Board.  This particular CD is a nice sampler of his work during the Capitol years (1953-1960).  In my opinion, his voice during this period was at its peak.  This should in no way be interpreted to mean that his work for Columbia and/or Reprise was subpar and I would certainly recommend anyone interested in Sinatra to listen to the music from those years as well.  That being said, these recordings, mainly arranged and conducted by the great Nelson Riddle, are beyond reproach. Whether it's a bar room ballad or a swinging song, Nelson and Sinatra are perfectly in sync.    If you do purchase this disc please be forwarned, you'll soon find yourself purchasing many more.  
 This is a first outing for Denzel Washington as an author.  Let me be among the many to congratulate him for a job well done. The central theme of the book is that we, all of us, are standing on the shoulders of others. There are seventy four inspirational, energizing, and motivational examples told to us by people from all walks of life.   Many quotes in the book are poignant, thought-provoking, and stimulating.  I especially liked and agreed with the one by James Baldwin:  "Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them."    Unfortunately, this is true for many young people who have bad role models as parents. Nonetheless the book gives hope and encouragement by showing others have overcome this obstacle with the help of influential organizations like The Girls and Boys Club of America.  Hank Aaron, Muhammad Ali, Bob Woodward,  James Worthy, and many others give heart-rendering examples of mentors who have helped them.    Page thirty four has a fascinating story from Walter Anderson, Editor in Chief,  Parade Magazine (he went to the same Boys Club in Mt. Vernon, NY as Mr. Washington).    He tells an inspiring story of a teacher in his neighborhood who showed him kindness, interest, and devotion.  He remembers prophetic words from her that changed his life:  "You can do this, Walter.  You can do this." Even when he would fail classes, be suspended from school, or have problems with authorities -she would not give up on him.  It is a powerful example of how lives can be influenced not just with money but with support.   Dale Carnegie was right when he said:  "Do not criticize, condemn, or complain." Instead - we should applaud, reward, and help others.  Buy this empowering book, enjoy the uplifting ride, and give someone the hand of encouragement. We can do this.  Reginald V. Johnson, author, "How To Be Happy, Successful, And Rich"     
  Another great performance of Pat Metheny Group. Can you imagine Pat Metheny and Wes Montgomery performing together  
 I've been a fan of Neil Young for over 35 years and have many of his CDs and DVDs but this is by far the best. Demme's directing and Young's performing are a superb winning combination. Ol' Neil even gets a wardrobe for this one! This is a must have for even a peripheral fan of Neil Young 
 Been watching this series on youtubedotcom, but it wasn't getting uploaded fast enough. The more I watch, the more intriguing the plot gets. Therefore, I will buy my own copy and not wait on youtube for the next episode.  To my knowledge, I haven't seen anything recently in the movies or on TV that is on the same caliber.   This drama really grabs my attention and pulls me in. And, I'm not much of a soap opera/chick flick/lovey dubby sort of guy neither. I'm more of an action/comedy type of guy. LO 
 Even though Mapplethorpe is better known for his controversial black and white nude photos, this book demonstrates his careful delicacy with not only the flowers but also the controlled lighting and the subtle colors. I have loved this book since the first time I leafed through it in studio photo class

 This swimsuit can double as a summer outfit. The colors are perfect and then there is Eeyore. Nice for girls that wear larger sizes 
 Have not had to use it yet so I don't know. Did I really need it I don't know but I bought it 
 I have always enjoyed listening to jazz singers who can set the mood for jazz music.  Johanna rendering of "Touch of Your Lips" and "The Very Thought of You" are superb including the band accompaniment which is well tailored to her voice and style. Bossa nova rhythm has always been my favourite and their interpretation of "Desafinado" will not disappoint others with similar taste for the rhythm.  If you are looking for some variety in jazz, this album is a good choice.   
 It's not often that you end up listening to a disk continuously for 4 years, but Future is on my ipod, in my car and on my home hifi, and I continue to find it the most satisfying electronica album I have. Deceptive in it's intitial simplicity, Future is deeper and darker and more complex than almost any other trip-hop out there. If you don't have this album in your collection... well, that's what's missing in your life 
 Now in a revised and updated second edition, Cooperative Capitalism: A Blueprint For Global Peace And Prosperity is a politically charged economic treatise that asks: why are so many resource-filled nations stricken with poverty while resource-poor nations are wealthy and consume the greater part of world resources? The answer according to author J. W. Smith is "plunder-by-trade", a process that destroys undeveloped nations' ability to process resources and sell them to their own people, forcing them to become dependent on imports and accelerating poverty because money flows directly out of the nation instead of circulating among the nation's people (the economic multiplier effect). Modern "plunder-by-trade" often involves selling subsidized food, or even donating clothing, putting local agriculture and textile operations out of business, increasing unemployment, and further impoverishing the nation - one example is the Ukraine, which went from breadbasket to bankrupt in response to foreign powers. Cooperative-Capitalism denounces such impoverishment and concentration of power in the wealthy elite of dominant nations as deliberate, accuses military efforts of dominant nations of furthering the process, and stridently calls for economic policy imperatives to reduce rather than create poverty - especially those promoting self-sufficiency through protectionism in the nations whose struggling industries need it the most. A serious-minded albiet strident discussion of a very real worldwide economic problem 
 very informative and a completely different perspective to consider, but it make total sense, i use to work in the pharmaceutical industry and i'm aware of what the pharma companies are capable of 
 The man is an absolute master at relationships. I have not read any other writer that has his patience and skill at building complex, realistic relationships through the accumulation of minute detail. While the characters and plot are only adequate, the relationships between the characters, and the poetic prose, drove the novel and managed to keep me engaged the whole way through. I was surprised that this novel, at least, showed no indication of the smuttiness of which Lawrence has often been accused. Overall, a good introduction to a literary author who will get another look later 
 What a striking novel. Heard of it from childhood and finally read it. As Laughable as it seemed, there were people very much like the one's in the story. Go deep south in the 40's or 50's and you would have seen them. They were there. They may still be there, or one's like them. Behind all the things that are funny to us lays dire hoplesness,selfishness, ignorance, and failure. But the main idea to the plot is they really didn't know or care. Their lives went on till they died and that was that. Again what a story. 
 I love the format of this book, and the concept the authors present. Putting it into practice requires structure (and a calm, organized determined parent), and I wish there were practice exercises- or ways to implement different strategies at different ages- or for different children with different personalities and needs. The idea of consequences and logical ones teaching responsibility- I absolutely agree with, but the reality of talking to a determined four old calmly after a long day at work, and not letting thier continued behavior not determine a drill seargent response has been a challenge which I am still working on 
 I love, love, love, this volume.  I'm a music major who studied piano and now have much less time to practice.  But, thanks to this compilation, all the best piano literature can be found in one place.  If you are a piano teacher, this book will be useful to you because it likely contains many pieces that your students 1) dream of learning or 2) would love to hear you play because they will recognize them.  In addition, the editors went out of their way to choose easier--and still famous--compositions by the famous composers.  For example, Chopin has several famous pieces, but the editors picked, among other pieces, the Raindrop Prelude, which is exceedingly gorgeous but relatively easy to play.  You won't find any monster ballades or comparabley difficult pieces.  I mean, instead of I'sle de Joyeuse, they picked the First Arabesque to represent Debussy . . . know what I mean?  A good pianist can fake their way through much of this and enjoy it leisurely.  
   This was an interesting read. Coonts really got into the emotions of the pilot. But dont think this is a touchy-feely book, there is enough action to rival Ludlum. Instead of just the hero side, the author gives you the whole picture 
 This is not a book I would've picked on my own.  It was a selection in a local book club.  Wallant is able to describe the undescribable...holocaust, horror, longing, as well as the everyday,  "...in the hallucinatory foyer before sleep..." Perfect.  I'm  glad that the book club has introduced me to this powerful novel, and to an  author of this caliber 
 This was a gift for my son for Christmas.  Today was the first day that the weather was good enough to assemble it and give it a try.    I was a little out done by the amount of time it took me to assemble it and then put it on the wagon.  It was a little tedious for me and would not recommend assembling it on an outing for the first time.    I left it up on the wagon in hopes that it would adjust its self now that it is out of the box.  It comes with a take along bag but if it is as hard to assemble as it was this first time I will not be taking it off when we are at home at all.    We live on the Gulf Coast so it is imperative that children be shaded in the summer heat and this seems like a good product overall.  The concept is very good I just hope it's easy to slap on when we go to the beach or to a festival, seeing that it's too large to keep up inside our SUV.  My overall comment is that I am happy for this product but the ease of it may not be the best.  When it's the only product out there you just have to like it and love it.  I am giving it a 4 star because the product its self seems to be durable at least.   
 This is a really good CD with Ferlin Husky. Almost every song reminds me of younger times and life lessions. It's the original sound without all the new add in instruments.  Jodi S 
 Easy to read print. Looks good on the outside, invaluable information on the inside. The book is a KJB which is closest to the original script 
   	"MacOSX Panther Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips &Tools" is an updating of the earlier "MacOSX Hacks" to address the newest operating system from Apple, OS 10.3, popularly known as "Panther". The Panther OS update continues to provide opportunity for basic users and power users to customize, tweek, and hack their machines. Unlike all previous Apple operating systems, the OSX iterations incorporating Unix underpinnings, legacy OS9 and Classic components, and a continuing evolving Mac GUI, provide unusually rich and complex textures allowing for all kinds of customizations.  	The book is a compilation of 100 ideas, hacks, tips, and tweeks contributed by a large handful of developers and power users covering mostly productivity-enhancing items, but also security and maintenance items, and some fun and geeky items. It is designed for the adventurous spirits who may need some guidance in customizing their machine and applications.  	There are nine chapters of such hacks. Chapter 1 covers the user interface including how to customize the Apple-provided animations like the "genie-effect". Available third-party applications for customizing the user interface, like Konfabulator, are noted and evaluated (Hacks #2).Others include launchers, desktop applications, keyboard shortcuts and the like. (Hacks 3-9).  	Other sections include an introduction to Applescript, Safari tips and tricks, multi-media tricks, file and device synchronization, and Unix tips and tricks, including how to use the Terminal application. Hack #27 is a guide to the hidden debug menu, which provides access to otherwise unknown Safari and browser features. Hack #30 informs how to use RSS with the Mac. You can learn to build your own MPS server from Hack #41 and build an emergency boot volume with iPod in Hack #52.  	Many of the hacks are quick and easy. Some require geek-level knowledge. The most interesting and perhaps most valuable sections deal with Panther maintenance and security. Hack #93 is a 19-page security  primer useful for both basic and power users. 
 As an increasingly greater number of people become directly or indirectly involved in investments of various kinds, their need for expert guidance also increases exponentially. For present purposes, let's segment individual investors within three categories:  1. Some prepare themselves to make their own investment decisions. It is noteworthy that Amazon now offers 3,634 books in the general category of "investing."  2.  Others retain the services of an intermediary (investment agent or firm).   3. And still others fully entrust their funds to institutional investors (e.g. TIAA/CREF).   Prentis seems to have written this book primarily for persons such as I who can be classified within one or both of the first two categories. Then president of Harvard, Derek Bok, once observed "If you think education is expensive, try ignorance." Prentis presumably agrees with Bok. He carefully studied 37 primary sources, most (if not all) considered "classics" among the 3,634 investment books now in print and he then combined what he learned from them with what he had also learned during his own career. The result is this book. In it, he recommends seven basic "principles" which are best revealed within the narrative; more importantly, within the context (i.e. frame-of-reference) he carefully establishes for each. To me, Prentis' key points concerning "astute" investors are that  They are life-long learners. Only then can they make (or agree to) each investment decision based on the best information available.  They trust their decisions and have confidence in them unless and until there is overwhelming, verifiable evidence to the contrary.  They constantly analyze their investments, meticulously calculating the current status of each.   They have "the courage of their convictions" but also possess the courage to make (or specify) modification(s) of their investment(s) when there is overwhelming, verifiable evidence that such action is necessary. Astute investors appreciate the fact that there are situations when it takes greater courage to do nothing than it does to buy or sell.   They also understand that rigorously enlightened judgment always trumps so-called "scientific" research and "hard data" as well as any one mathematical formula or calculation.   Most individual investors will welcome Prentis' brief but sufficient coverage in Part 1 of investing principles and strategies; investment theory and practice; equity and bond fundamentals; stock market technical analysis; trading psychology; intrinsic, market, and bargain values; interest rate principles; interpreting the news; "Being Contrarian"; and "The Ten-Step Method For Investing Success." Then in Part 2, Prentis discusses retirement planning and then discounted capital market theory followed by a Conclusion, Glossary,  Bibliography, and Index.  Basic stuff? Of course. Any head-snapping revelations? None which I (at least) encountered. However, I rate this book so highly because the material is  intentionally fundamental but solid and well-organized. It soon becomes obvious that Prentis is attempting to share everything he knows (including what he has learned from others) so that both the information and counsel provided will help each of his readers to become an "astute" investor and thereby a successful one 
 I consider myself an advanced exerciser and this had me sweating buckets!  It's a great overall cardio and weight workout and the ab section at the end is wonderful.  The cueing is great, and so is the music.  It's also very easy to follow the beginner moves if you're new to working out or the FIRM style.  Previewing it before you actually do it is helpful since some of the moves are very quick paced.  I highly recommend it 
 When I want to describe Converge's latest album, the first word that comes to mind is "more". No Heroes sees Converge taking their signature sound - intense thrash/hardcore/extreme metal/punk sound with enough depth to keep your mind absorbed on the 100th listen, and adding more to it. More thrash. More hardcore. More sludge. More progressive. More melody. More speed. More heavy. More experimental. More refined. More technical. More emotion... etc. Even the production is the best of all the Converge albums (although the headache inducing wall-of-sound that Jane Doe still holds a place in my heart); Nate Newton's bass tone is to die for.  They don't manage to do all of these all at once (I don't think that would be possible), but once the last few notes of No Heroes fade out, my ears feel as though they have heard some material that is heavier than Jane Doe, and other material that is proggier than You Fail Me. In doing this Converge have made an album unlike any of their last four: rather than being focused on the album as a whole, it seems as though No Heroes focuses more on each song. The result of this is that quite a few of the songs burn themselves into your cerebellum very, very quickly ("No Heroes", "Plagues", "Grim Heart / Black Rose", "Trophy Scars", and "To The Lions" come to mind) and, while many song-oriented albums come off as incomplete and disjointed, No Heroes still works just as well as a full album as any of Converge's previous works.  The album starts things off fast, vicious, and heavy for the first four tracks, all of which clock in at under two minutes. A brief sludgy reprieve acts as the introduction to "No Heroes", which is passionately heavy in the way only Converge are. These first six tracks, which flow together, combine to form Converge's heaviest and most brutal music yet. "Plagues" is very similar to You Fail Me's title track as the song slowly builds upon the same riff until its climax hits you like an avalanche. "Grim Heart / Black Rose" came as such a pleasant surprise to me that the only description I'll give is that it is tied with "Jane Doe" as my favourite Converge song... and if that's Jacob Bannon he's now among my top 5 vocalists. The last third of the album sees Converge exploring the more stripped down, melodic, hardcore-ish side of their music, which climaxes with the I want to live! finale of "Trophy Scars" before launching headlong into a duo of righteously heavy songs.  In conclusion, No Heroes not only proves that Converge are still amazing, but that they are getting even better at it (if this continues their next album might be scary). While they are still sounding like the same band that made Petitioning the Empty Sky and When Forever Comes Crashing, they have expanded, improved and elaborated on this sound to the umpteenth degree. And how many other bands can you think of that have released 5 albums in a row that range from great to masterpieces? (Neurosis... any others? 
 Drs. Poussaint and Alexander poises thought provoking questions on the rise of African American suicides especially among young males. The authors states, if African Americans endured over three centuries of slavery and Jim Cow laws without succumbing to hopelessness and self negation, why is their a surge in suicides today? Is crime and poverty, (the catalysts of hopelessness) contributing to the demise of young African American males? Is the participation of young African Americans in drug and alcohol abuse, unsafe sex, a form suicide, related to unfulled dreams and a feeling of hoplessness? The authors set out to answer these questions in the context of the pervasiveness of racism, which greatly contributes to a "mental health crisis" which is tightening its grip among young African Americans 
 I've used a battery grip on almost every Canon camera I've owned since 1980. This Rebal XT battery life seems to be almost forever and with the battery grip, that gets doubled.  The grip also allows you to use regular batteries so you could use them should the rechargables ever die on you and need to keep shooting.  It adds another shutter release button for turning the camera 90 degrees.   Larger hands would probably find the camera more comfortable with more grip area.  It adds more mass which can be a pro (a little more stability) or a con (heavier to carry around).  It would have been nice if Canon could have slightly remolded it to stand the camera up. As it is, the camera will lean forward on it lense.  Bottom Line: I'm glad I purchased but think it could have been much cheaper. When you consider (way back when) these types of devices added a motor winder (standard on modern film SLRs and not used on digital cameras) along with added battery capacity. All this adds is additonal battery capacity.  The price is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Of course most businesses don't care as long as people are buying.  Mark  
 This is the first Sublime album I owned and I now own all of them and would have to say this is their best work. This CD made me wanna go buy all their CDs right away if they are this good. Every song has a different style and sound to it and it just doesnt get old. From ska to punk to some reggae and even some hip hop, this band knows how to incorporate all the styles of music into one great masterpiece. You cant go wrong buying this album, there are 22 songs on here that are worth the money, so get it already. 
 I bought this book in 1990.  I carried it around in my purse for over a year reading and re-reading it.  It helped launch me in the career of my dreams.  Whenever I felt afraid, I would read this book.  Whenever I felt I wouldn't make it, I read this book.  I will give my daughter a copy when she graduates high school.  Dr. Dyer shares personal experiences and practical examples to help guide you.  He has been ahead on the road of happy transformation and he shares insights that are rock solid.  If I was stranded on a desert island, I'd take this book.  I have the audio cassette version as well, and am buying the CD version, too 
 Joel Salatin brings optimism and energy to this series of essays on how he raises beef (and other livestock ) on grass for direct market to urban consumers. He reveals his tricks in great detail, such as the egg-mobile, the pig-aerator, electric fencing, the warm winter hay shed, and how to promote the meat. A must for anyone looking for new ideas on raising livestoc 
 This is one of the best WWII social histories I've read (and I've read a few since I am grad student studying society during WWII).  It is thorough, covers a variety of topics, and is engagingly written.  A must for any history buff or student of WWII 
 This a great compact book that deals beautifully with tea and its history and setting.  You'll feel as though you are listening to Kakuzo Okakura personally.  As I read it, I could feel the presence of a smile on his face.   Not deep.  Not complex.  Compact and enjoyable.  A great intro to tea all around 
 Maggie and her husband Ira are going to the funeral of the husband of Maggie's childhood friend, Serena.  As they travel, their opposite personalities are revealed.  Maggie is a well-meaning "fixer" of situations and people, whose plans often go awry.  Ira is a much more reticent person, who is constantly frustrated by what he sees as his wife's interference in the lives of others.  The funeral they attend is a reunion of many of their old friends and they soon discover that Serena is attempting to recreate her wedding at the ceremony.  When that is behind them they head for home and on the way they have an encounter with an elderly black man.  Their last stop is at the home of Fiona, their former daughter-in-law where, in true Maggie fashion, she tries to patch up Fiona's marriage with their son.  This is a difficult book to rate, because it all seems so hopeless and unchanging.  However, the accurate insights into marriage, relationships, and life are definitely above average, which is why I gave it 4 stars.   
 This one of the best cd's I've bought yet. Chamillionaire comes out the gate 100 miles and running, and stoping. He's got what could the best features on a album. Songs for everyone in tha fam(lol). If you ain't got it, go get it, and that screwd and chopped joint too. Damn I Split My Drink,LOL  Beats:5 stars Verses:5 stars Paint drippin,cup slippin,straight pimpin: priceless  Rell aka

 I found this book useful for it's treatment of two key topics: the idea that "Satan" only became an important figure with the  introduction of Christ and the idea that the "crucified Christ" of Catholicism may itself consitute the "shadow side." Jung isn't  always easy to read, but he's invariable rewarding 
 The first time I saw 'Cook's Tour' on the Food Network I took one look at Mr. Bourdain and said; Hold the phone!  He's a chef! He's the best looking guy on TV!  Then, as I continued to watch the show every week, and go to all the exotic countries he took us to, I realized the guy is brilliant.  I have bought ALL of his books, including his novels.  He is the kind of guy I was looking for in my 20's and 30's but unfortunately never found. I did run into him on a NYC street a couple of years ago and talked with him.  He is a charmer and a really nice guy.  Of course now that I'm old enough to be his mom I am able to gush over guys and they don't think; Stalker!  Read this book and all his other books.  Like Mr. Bourdain, they are very interesting and informative.  I just love the guy. 
 If you are a rock fan and thinking about jazz, this is a great album for you! This album showcases Miles, he keeps it funky and rocking at hte same time 
 Despite having lost Frampton, this is the best studio album that Steve Marriott and his merrymen ever did.  30 Days is the quintessential rock single.  The heaviness of The Fixers is counterd by So Good, which was so good that the Stones ripped it off for Till the Next Goodbye.  To quote Greg Kihn, they just don't write em like this any more 
 I love Carol Lea Benjamin's books.  Check out her Secondhand Dog and Surviving Your Dog's Adolescence, too. :)  My very favorite dog books are by Patricia McConnell.  Her wonderful books are wise, humane, and so enjoyable.  I highly recommend The Other End of the Leash, Beginning Family Dog Training, and How to be the leader of the pack...And have your dog love you for it. 
 Barbara Hermann is one of the leading scholars in the country on Kant's moral theory. Having taken several philosophy courses from her in college, including a course on Kant, I would describe her views on Kant's normative ethics as highly subtle and sophisticated. In this book, she presents her strong reading of Kant's moral philosophy in a clear and accessible manner. Students of Kant would do well to study this book to deepen and enrich their understanding of Kant's moral thought 
 Just kidding, this book and movie share a common deliciousness. Very little can be said, that hasn't been said already, other than if you have seen the movie, you should by all means, read the book 
 My Father and Myself, by J.R. Ackerley, lends insight into the minds of two men, both curious and proud, both leading secret lives. The book, in reality, is two parallel stories that merge into one. Both stories attribute the same themes: upholding honor to one's family and self-worth; love; past lives; abandonment; and learning to accept truth, even if one is not prone to liking it, or respecting it. I like the way the book, written like a carefully plotted novel, is thoughtful in it's approach to building upon the "history" of both father and son while slowly revealing that both men had secrets. And each secret tells of a son's ultimate forgiveness of a father and a father's loyalty to his families, however way one looks at it. Clever in its approach, witty in its storytelling, My Father and Myself is a good read, one that allows the reader to dwelve into the pysche and lives of two men. The reader will learn something, too, as the book ultimately teaches a story about perception and reality 
 Believe it, this is a stunningly beautiful watch and no one will guess the price unless you tell them.  It gets more attention than my gold Rolex!  As for the weight, it is normal for stainless which means a solid feel and you know it's there.  If someone wants a flyweight watch why would they buy stainless steel?  It reliably functions exactly as described.  You'll love this watch.  Buy the 5-year extended warranty for $25 and enjoy it.  P.S.  If you need to remove links, just put a smoothed paperclip in a vice to push the pins out.  No big deal 
 Brad Free's Handicapping 101 is an outstanding book for the purpose that it was meant.  Will this book make you an instant winner at the track?  Probably not.  Will it make you win more?  Maybe.  Will it help educate a beginner on what to look for, how to read past performances, and when/how to bet?  DEFINITELY.    I have always loved horse racing, but mainly went to the races for a day of cheap entertainment and excitement.  I'd bet $2-4 a race "just to keep it interesting."  I rarely came away a winner, and when I did, I felt it was just pure luck.  After getting into the game of much more this year and taking regular trips to Keeneland and Churchill Downs, I wanted to get serious.    Handicapping 101 hasn't made me rich or an instant winner right away, but it definitely has made me a much more informed horse player who stands a MUCH better chance than the general betting public.  This book is extremely well written and is a joy to read.  If you're a beginner who really wants to get into the game, start here!  
 I just finished "Heart Of A Woman".  I had read "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" last year.  Several weeks ago I decided to read the rest of her books.  Thus, I've read "Gather Together In My Name", and "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas" in succesion.  This book is one of the best that I've ever read, and I read alot of books!  Her life is so interesting and eventful.  Even though she relates her trajedies as well as her joys, you don't feel sorry for her, because through everything she remains true to herself and thereby comes out on top.  Her tender devotion to her son is very touching.  Through a childhood of constant changes he is depicted as a wonderful human being, equally devoted to his mother.  There are parts of the book where I was laughing out loud at situations she gotten her self into and how she handled them.  What a woman!  I've just ordered "Travelin' Shoes", which I think is the last in the series of autobiographical books.  I will continue to read her poems and whatever works she has produced.  She is a woman to be respected and admired 
 This book is a treasure for all scientists, particularly graduate students. The author covers each detail of writing a paper in its own chapter in a consise, clear and sometimes funny way. I recommend this book as a basic reference, if you need more help in one area, then consult other books 
 Tremendous new release by what is destined to be one of America's great writers.  Vin Smith absolutely nails the fear and confusion that parents experience when a child is abducted. It's like the reader is right there with V. J. Dixon, as his child is snatched in the Northwest woods.  The way he weaves the townsmen and women and extended family into the search is nothing short of breathtaking writing.  Crackling dialogue, edge-of-your-seat page turner.  Also he uses no wasted pages, the book is very lean, yet dense in its storytelling style.  The reader is never shortchanged.  I'll read anything he writes 
 This complicated,work so full of ambiguity and difficulty in language and style is one I have found almost unreadable. The broad spaces and the great ranging adventurous mind of Melville in Moby Dick(The work which preceded this and in which all of Melville's writing climaxed) is followed by a claustrophic, domestic drama which seems to go nowhere.  My sense many other people have a more generous attitude towards this work, than I do and understand it more deeply.  As my old high- school Physics teacher Dave Levenstein ( of blessed memory) said when asked about the Theory of Relativitiy-  "I read some of that Einstein stuff and I just didn't get it."  In regard to 'Pierre" I too "just didn't get it. 
 This book is excellent. It is "applied" feng shui -- the book is well designed, with high quality photos and illustrations to help you overlay the bagua, and feng shui principles throughout your whole outside environment.  She addresses landscape design (feng shui) using color, lighting, material choices, water features, etc., and placement very logically -- using ancient concepts. This book is one of the best of many feng shui books I've read, and after breezing through the book I was able to sketch our house and property to scale, using the bagua overlay, to analyze and plan our landscape design with confidence.  
 I am what this book characterizes as a compulsive spender. Reading this book not only helped me get my spending under control but also helped me change my opinion on how I viewed money in my life. It really goes through different types of people such as the compulsive spender (me), to the cash co-dependant--someone who actually assists someone with their money issues (i.e. a woman who is continuously giving a boyfriend her money, when he continuously loses the money and does not do him nor her any good.). This book works on self esteem and an "I can do" attitude towards money. The first half of the book focuses on finding what type of "Money Drunk" you are and identifying with other scenarios with quick stories and examples. The second half is the battle plan, that lasts 90 days and is grouped into different themes; Awarness (Finding out what and how you acquired this problem), Acceptance (Learning to deal with your addiction), and Action (Do something about it and how). It even has a relapse checklist and a section towards the end on spirituality. If you are not into the religion aspect, please note the book does not "steer" you towards counting directly on religion so don't worry. Everyone can enjoy and benefit from this book which is easy to read and flows well... Even loved ones of money drunks can benefit from this book. I get distracted easily and never seem to finish a book but this book was so well written and gave me such continuous hope I couldnt help but keep on reading 
 Joe Pearce's so-called "unmasking of Wilde" is nothing more than a gambit to capitalize on the popularity of Wildean scholarship--firstly rushed to publication in 2000 at the centenary of Wilde's death; then reissued in 2004 at the 150th anniversary of Oscar's birth.  The book is a bogus rip-off of Ellmann and Hyde, simplified for simpletons at a junior high school reading level.  Pearce denigrates Ellmann's magnum opus while quoting from it continuously; he quotes from Hyde without even commenting on his great work.  (Yes, Ellmann died just prior to publication of his Oscar Wilde, so there were a couple of mistakes in it; however, Horst Schroeder has corrected all these in his Additions and Corrections to Ellmann's Wilde.  End of story.)  For a really insightful vision of Wildean literary criticism in a Christian vein, seek: The Moral Vision of Oscar Wilde by Philip K. Cohen.  Pearce's tripe is a waste of time and money 
 i think that this book is a great book because it can put kids to sleep and let them try to read on there own.When kids try to read on there own it can let them have a felling for themselfs that they are doing something great and it's all by themselfs.Sometimes when i read this book to people in my family it seems to make there faces light up with joy whenever i pull this book out.I hope that you love this book and so does your child 
 This recommended software is easy to load, except for online requirements to update the files due to changes in the documents from the time of publication/software release.  The files for download was large and took a long time on a dialup internet connection.    The software was easy to use, without documentation, though documentation would have been much desired.  The time to fill in the data was not too long.  It took about 4-6 hours given that I had been filing all the tax info in a folder with all the references required.  The help in the software was great and insightful.  I preferred using a CPA in the past, but since my taxes has gotten significantly easier, this has been a definite cost savings.  E-filing was easy, but make sure not to lose the cd-sleeve after downloading the software. Otherwise, it costs extra to e-file.  Overall, it appears to be a great software package with great info and help.  I plan to use it next year, Lord willing! 
 I've been playing NCAA 2007 for a few weeks now, and here are my thoughts: 1) The game simply does as good a job at capturing the feeling of it's sport as any other game.  Anyone who has been to a big-time SEC game understands that the stadium does shake. 2) I did not play the "career" mode, I simply prefer control over the whole program. 3) Gameplay is very strong, anyone who has played NCAA or Madden in the past will notice the tightening up of the controls. 4) I personally do not like the first person camera on special teams plays, it makes it frustratingly difficult to return kicks. 5) Likewise I could do without the auto slo-motion on "key" plays.  It absolutely destroys the flow of the play to highlight a catch or hit during the play.  EA, that's what replay is for. 6) The system is annoyingly apt to hit me with unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, not just on TD's but simple catches or defensive plays. 7)You now have more control over recruiting with in-season recruiting, including mulitple pitches and on-campus visits. 8)After all these versions can EA come up with a new set of unlockables.  Changing the logo, or the sponsor(!) does not a new unlockable make 
 This is the best book about travelling that I have ever read. It really encapsulates the feelings one has when living (as a backpacker) for an extended period in a foreign country. I have read many books on Afghanistan from miltary history to great game literature to the modern day problems and this is the only book I have found which has a positive outlook. He cuts through all of the politics and mass media rhetoric and tells the human story. Elliot has such a great sense of humour and it runs in currents throughout the book. I loved this book and I will definitely read it again. We need more authors out there who can see the good in everyone -- the fact that we are all human beings and we share the fundamental hopes, joys and humour of life 
 Product was delivered in a prompt manner and was received in perfect condition 
 Written in 1922 , this book is a  history of the world from pre-historic man to the First World War , written in a rather satirical , philosophical and whimsical style that makes it a great piece of literature. He deals quite comprehensively for 400 pages with this broad work on civilization. It also flows nicely.It is fascinating to read of the murder by the Bolsheviks of the Romanov family , as described by the author as a recent event. It is indeed written from the perspective of 1922:"The world has just passed through an agony of pain compared to which the French Revolution was a mere incident. The shock has been so great that it has killed the last spark of hope in the breasts of millions of men. They were chanting a hymn of progress, and four years of slaughter followed their prayers for peace. ``Is it worth while,'' so they ask, ``to work and slave for the benefit of creatures who have not yet passed beyond the stage of the earliest cave men?'' "  That being said , the work is not free of the authors own prejudices.  A incorrect bit is his refferal to the ancient Land of Israel as Palestine , when speaking about he entry of the Hebrews into that land in 1700 BC. The term "Palestine" came from the name that the conquering Roman Empire gave the ancient Land of Israel in an attempt to obliterate and de-legitimize the Jewish presence in the Holy Land. The name "Palestine" was invented in the year 135 C.E.  Before it was known as Judea, which was the southern kingdom of ancient Israel. The Roman Procurator in charge of the Judean-Israel territories was so angry at the Jews for revolting that he called for his historians and asked them who were the worst enemies of the Jews in their past history. The scribes said, "the Philistines."  Thus, the Procurator declared that Land of Israel would from then forward be called "Philistia" [further bastardized into "Palaistina"] to dishonor the Jews and obliterate their history. Hence the name "Palestine."   
 This book is mostly about tactics (99% tactics and the rest are some puzzles on positional play) and I must say that like it even better than other famous "1000 combinations..." books. You can tell that the author took his time to select the best puzzles that present the most challenge for players. Some of the positions (not that many) in the book are very well known. Mr. Alburt ensures that you calculate ALL possible variations. Some moves that seemed so obvious at first could be a complete disaster if a player overlooks the best opponent's responses.  A beginner may find these puzzles a bit hard to solve. But the earlier one starts the better.  This is a pocket size book that you can take anywhere and have fun with. Don't let the tacky cover stop you from buying it. 
 This is truly a great pop album.  Having group members who are actually very talented singers very much helps too.  The lads also flex some writing skills with "Love Crime" and "I want to grow old with you", (the latter surely to become a wedding favorite.)  With the success incurred in sales and talent of the voices (especially Shane Filan), Westlife holds the key to its staying power 
 This CD is a must have for anyone that knows what musicianship is.  So much of the newer music sounds the same.  This is not the case with this CD.  It has an originality that you have to appreciate.  The vocals are unique and fine tuned.  The band just rocks.  If you get a chance to see them live do.  They won't disappoint you at all 
 Bought this for my 2 year old grandaughter. She's tiny and was afraid of the bigger bed, so this was perfect for her. She loves the bed and sleeps very well in it 
 We are all searching for answers on how to lead a fulfilled life.  The answers are within all of us, but often we look elsewhere to try and find the answers through comparison and material possessions.  I have by no means mastered the lessons taught by James Allen, but can see that with time, patience, and persistance I can be at peace with myself.  This work is greatly enhanced with a goal setting plan.  The combination allows us to create a plan and a framework to live by.  The result is the ability to ultimately construct the fulfilled life we are all searching. This is not a read and put away book.  One really has to think about the messages conveyed 
 I read this book 10 years ago and am still savoring it.  You may not be a history buff nor a gardener, but this book is as readble as any airport novel, and has the added pow of self-enrichment.  No one who reads it will be wasting their time. -from a non-intellectua 
 It was  in verry good shape, and the shipping time was OK 
 Aaron Russo goes after the top echelons in the information wars being played upon the American public/ placing the crosshairs on the IRS/Federal Reseve. Using Congressmen, IRS agents, FBI, tax attorneys, and several well informed authors(Griffin-Secret of Jeckyl Island and Ruppert- Crossing the Rubicon), he lays it out to where both Republican & Democrat can see this is an important precient film. He brings us up to date with the latest technology:RFID-radio frequency identification chips that can be implanted, new national ID card required by law May 2008, The Security and Prosperity Project of North America.  Its all here in an easy to understand format. Perhaps his quote of Goeth sumss it up best- None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they fre 
 Another great book from a great author.  Silly illustrations & good text make fun reading with kids.  This book follows the same pattern as Parr's The Mommy Book, The Daddy Book, etc. which makes it familiar for kids with the whole collection.  Lots of fun for Grampie, too...a sweet gift to help announce a first grandchild 
 This is a fantastic program for sculpting the entire body using no special equipment other than a pull-up bar.  Well illustrated with high quality photos and clear, well-written text, this book sets forth a thorough set of exercises for each section of the body and includes a workable, real-world dietary program.  Mr. Peterson has taken the concepts of the Atlas course, modernized them, explained them in greater detail, and illustrated each in a manner that leaves no confusion as to form.  The only glitch in the book is Mr. Peterson's apparent idolization of Matt Furey by placing Furey in the "Heroes" section of the book along with such veritable icons as Earle Liedermann, Charles Atlas, Herschel Walker, and Rocky Marciano, each a champion of bodyweight strength training 
 The hottest thing since sunburn! You MUST have this cd even if you are a 'casual' listener of the genre. If you're a guitarist, set your ears to STUN!!!! 
 Katy is a municipal snow plow serving a small village who is hit by a massive snow storm.  Adults who think it silly that machines are made to behave like people in picture books should remember the little engine that could.  Katy has no doubt that she can tackle any snow, and when a massive snow storm hits, she is called to duty.  The firemen, the police, the doctors, the postmaster, and others all cry out for help from Katy.  When Katy began to tire, she pressed on - she wouldn't stop.  She is the heroine who saves the village.  What makes this book more than interesting is that the author is also the illustrator, which means that there is thought behind these illustrations that they should intertwine with the dramatic plot of the text.  Each illustration shows the trails plowed through the snow by Katy.  With each progressive illustration, the trails become more numerous and complex to where they begin to look like maps.  These illustrations partner nicley with the text to produce an emerging cadence in the dialogue 
 "Whirlpool" is a swirl of hypnotizing deceit, revenge, and murder.  The beautiful Gene Tierney plays the kleptomaniac rich wife of psychiatrist, Richard Conte, who falls prey to the evil intentions of hypnotist, Jose Ferrer.  Otto Preminger directs this film noir drama, that keeps the viewers attention throughout.  Jose Ferrer is especially entertaining as the menacing hypnotist, who uses Gene Tierney to do his dirty work.  This movie is a classic who-done-it, which had me knowing who must have obviously done it, but wondering "how" or "who" they used to do it.  This one has a great conclusion at the end of the picture.  "Whirlpool" is the ninth volume in the "Fox Film Noir" series and a very good addition.  I highly recommend "Whirlpool" to film noir and Gene Tierney fans, and also recommend Otto Preminger's masterpiece "Laura" and the Fox Studio Classics release "Leave Her To Heaven," a story of psychotic obsession, also starring the lovely Gene Tierney.  
 This is the start of a terrific series - fast, funny, sexy and suspenseful 
 I just had a baby and wanted to learn more about vaccinations. This book provided a great foundation of knowledge. The only down side was since the book has been written many of the vaccinations have done away with thermosal (mercury)- which is great. My Ped. said the alternative schedule was fine, but dated.   Overall, glad I read it but wish it was written with the most current vaccine info 
 Hence the title, some Pac fans like this the best, others give the crown to All Eyez On Me, Makaveli or even one of the first two. Well all Pac's albums (before the posthumous ones) are fantastic so i definitely respect those opinions. But for me this is the one i listen to the most (which is at least twice a day!!!)  There isn't a single dissapointment here. All the beats are excellent, the guest appearances aren't that bad and limited and Pac shines all the way through. Now i'm not going to review all the tracks as that would take up alot of space. So i'll just comment on my top 5, which are 1. Dear Mama -Absolute genious!!! My favourite Pac song ever!!! 2. F*ck The World - A very haunting beat with 4 short verses of Pac letting out all his anger (he was going through some very hard things back then as you know) 3. Young N*ggaz - A nice jazzy beat while Pac goes through his young days to his present. A brilliant hook aswell. 4. So Many Tears - Known as the darkest rap song ever.  5. Can U Get Away - Alot of people consider this the weakest off the album, but i love it.  Honorable mention: Me Against The World - One of Pac's most instrospective tracks ever  Anyway peace and rest in peace to                           Tupac Amaru Shakur - 1971-1996 (We all miss ya 
 A stirring, deeply affecting account of one man's gradual resignation to the unrelenting grip of alcoholism. London at his electrifying, almost unsettling best. A must-read for all students of language and writing 
 This books is a very easy read and address all the issues of this time of a woman's life.  From empty nesting to taking care of elderly parents to finding a spiritual connection - it is discussed.  Bought several copies for friends especially at this bargain price 
 I used this product to dehydrate pineapple, apple slices, grapes, and bananas.  It took about 12 hours for the pineapple but everything else took probably about 9 hours.  I think someone else commented that it is noisy but while it does make a whirring sound, it was not something that was distracting at all, more like if you had a fan on in your house.  The unit has four shelves and held enough fruit to make about a quart-size baggie worth of dried fruit.  (Actually probably a bit more, I didn't completely use all the space)  The fruit was great.  Particularly for the price, I am very satisfied with this product 
 A great book that shows how no matter what people still change given the right situations 
 I am truly blessed to own TWO ORIGINAL copies.  Plus, they are both SIGNED copies.  I spent a month in Herrogate,England in 1985.  I went on EVERY Herriot Tour.  Easy to see why Herriot never left the Dales.    I own ALL the Herriot books, and do wish they would show the TV Series again.  Think of all the people who have never seen this wonderful TV program 
 Lot's of good information in this delightful little book. It was a joy to read! 
 I wanted to test my 1080p HDTV. Unless you have a Blue-ray, the only way to view a full HD on a 1080p TV is with a computer. This WMVHD disk plays great eventhough I have only a VGA connection (my laptop does not have a DVI connection). Resolutions and details are so life like, you have to run it to believe it. I would like more commercial movies in this format 
 This book was great.  I will continue to read Nora Roberts and share her books with friends 
 Lexie dreams of being a skater and making it big, but she doesn't want to give up Nick. Nick has dreams of his own, he wants to be a big time hockey player. As Lexie and Nick follow their dreams, they lose sight of what is important....their love. On her way to making it big, tradgedy strikes and Lexie loses her sight. She goes back home to her small town and wants to give up on life. Enter Nick. Never accomplishing his goal of playing pro hockey, Nick is in a slump of his own. Nick makes Lexie get back on the ice, because he knows she is happy there. This heals both of their wounded hearts. One day during a skating session, a plan formulates in Nick's mind....getting Lexie back on the skating circut. They practice and she re-learns her way on the ice. Everyone in competiton thinks she has gotten her sight back, she skates beautifully! Problems arise again when the skate is over and everyone throws roses on the ice...Nick and Lexie did not plan for this! Lexie falls, and the jig is up....everyone knows she is blind! Struggling on her hands and knees on the ice, Nick walks out and picks her up and tells her everything is ok, and walks her back to the middle of the rink......they kiss, the crowd cheers...credits roll.  Robby Benson and Lynn Holly Johnson are great in their roles. Tom Skeritt and Colleen Dewhurst round out the cast as the overprotective father (Skeritt) and Lexie's skating coach (Dewhurst). The Theme song for this movie is wonderful. If you have not seen this movie.....watch it, it is a must 
 After seeing the news on the new wave in hollywood discovering scientology I needed to pass this book on.  It covers Christian cults in America and abroad.  Describing them as cults is not a degrading term, but merely the understanding they are a transformation of true biblical teachings.  This book contains most of them.  One should know the teachings of these religions.  They can be quite destructive.  Although not considered christian, Islam has been included because it does use parts of the christian bible.  Of course with what's going on in the world with terrorism, one would be wise to understand Muslim teachings and the Koran, especially with it being the second largest religion                                                                       
 Overall this text is slightly better than good.  After reading almost the whole book I found that for someone interested in theory and not so much in technique, this is a good read.  It does go over some good points about planning your security model and gives good advice on how to approach security in your organization.  It even goes through a basic install of CheckPoint FW-1 for NT.  Topics including policy, legal issues and the user's ability to comply with policy are interesting but not why I bought this book.  I thought Chris put some good information in this text but the title doesn't accurately match the content 
 I have read several of Thomas Moore's book and this is probably one of my favorites.  
 What can I say?  This book is probably the closest Chinese book involving the art of parallel-argumentation that a person will ever get out of a Chinese book.    I love this book.  Plus, Lau really adds desert by his five highly detailed appendixes.  Way to go Lau 
 Excellent DVD on Townes Van Zandt. Highly recommend to people who enjoy Townes music 
 Women in the bible are often not a topic discussed in church or elsewhere. This book is a wonderful look at the ignored parts of the bible, (and I don't mean every book after Exodus).  Women did participate in the bible  and this book celebrates their accomplishments and gives them long overdue  praise 
 I was being driven nuts by all my kids' different demands for meals!  This book helped me figure out how to deal with all of their differences, and to stop fighting about it with my husband!  Excellent guide  
 I finally read this book after hearing my mom and sister raving about it for months. It was very fast paced and kept my attention. I enjoyed the intelligent angle and all the talk about mathematics. It confused me, but also intrigued me to read.  However, I thought the book would have been well-written without the Christian slant. I understand that that's probably the whole purpose, but the dialogue of Miriam and Seth about religion almost seems like a distraction anytime they talk about it. I am Christian and I enjoy Christian literature (though I'm picky about what I read) but I didn't like the interweaving of clairvoyance/supernatural things with religion. I understand that prophets were given that gift, but the book would have been wonderful without it.  Also, I learned about Saudi Arabia, but I will get a second opinion before forming my own opinion about the country and Islam. The author focused on the militant, extremist side of Islam and that's not what the whole group of people who call themselves Muslim is all about. I was disturbed because it seemed like because praying to the God of Jesus "worked", they believed. To me, that's not the only reason to place one's faith in Jesus Christ.  I have been skeptical of many Christian books, simply because it doesn't give one the whole story. Like I said, the book would have been better without the Christian slant. But great job, Dekker, it was a great read and I will recommend it to people 
 Not only good for hot beverages, including that caffeine-overdose-sized morning coffee,  these mugs also make great soup, chili, ice cream and cereal bowls!  Add some color and fun to your kitchen with this great Fiestaware jumbo mug set 
  My diet changed after reading this book.  Suggest to do the same and eat the categories of food recommended in the book. Try to go organic.  Look for more free info on the internet.  There is a lot of it 
 I've been working with this book (with children) for many years and have just bought my fifth copy (as they seem to 'disappear' whenever I loan them to children to take home--I suspect they love them too much to part with them for good!). The idea of reality being what we're used to it being (not rather what it HAS to be everywhere), as well as the hilarity of the situation the people of the story are faced with is just delightful. It is an excellent resource of rich vocabulary and expression, and the drawings are believable and at the same time jaw dropping. Highly recommended to all ages, especially preschool through the lower grades 
 Excellent book, with a lot of helpful essays samples. Being a foreign student, this book really helped me to understand the American concept of personal statement letters and what the Universities admissions committees are really looking for 
 I found this book to be quite useful for learning R, and for pointing out the pitfalls for new users.  It's especially good to know that there is a website associated with the book that will allow you to download the code used in the book.  There are several good free R resources out there, but in the end I think you get what you pay for.  In this case it was nice to have a hard-bound reference with an index and appendix that I could highlight and dog-ear.  I mostly used it as a book for learning R, and not as a stats book.  I did notice that there were many good examples of common statistical applications, such as t-stat tests, residual plotting, and the like. In other words, I feel like I got my money's worth by just using a few chapters and the appendix 
 This is a must read for anyone interested in management, albeit written 40 years ago, many of the things in this book is part of today's B-School's curriculum 
 When I'm fairly certain that the world just may not be unfolding as it should, the temperature is near 100, and the U. S. casualties from the War In Iraq now have reached over 2,500-- the newscasters rarely give figures of anyone else--STRICTLY BALLROOM is one of a handful of films that always makes me smile. Set in Australia and directed by Baz Luhrmann, it's all about winning the Pan Pacific Grand Prix ballroom dancing competition. Besides the extraordinary dancing by the two principal actors Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice, the story is one that most of us want to believe: that in the end-- after all that's what happens in romantic comedies-- boy gets girl, ugly duckling becomes suave swan, the older generation get a chance to try things again, or at least see their broken dreams achieved by their children, and good triumphs over the cynical, bad guys.  In addition to the fine performances by Mercurio and Morice, the other actors are quite wonderful, particularly the Hasting parents. Golden hair color not found in nature and toupees abound, as does delicious humor.  Leave it to the Aussies to do everything right in a movie.  
 This book offers the story of Christian Faith no matter what obstacles might come about. It also offers great insight into the life of poor middle eastern people.  Also how normal aspects of life for Americans (soap, toothbrush, cheese, any little extra food), are greatly valued presents over there.  Peace I'm Ou 
 I got this CD for the "Suddenly I See" song that was in The Devil Wears Prada, but I must say, I love almost every song, can't keep the tunes or the words out of my head!!  Just click on the samples and you'll see for yourself 
 I have to say that the sound is impeccable, however the noise it makes when changing discs makes me want to send this player back.  I just got it, but I am having second thoughts.  I bought this player specifically for my son who has autism.  I love that it has no buttons and so he can't really break anything or take out the CD. However, the noise of the CD change wakes him up every time ..How disappointing to put so much into the sound of the music and so little into the mechanical aspects. The sound quality is amazing though 
 Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas in an erotic thriller. What better do you want from an action movie. The story is well written, enough to keep you intrigued through out all the movie. A similar movie would be 9 1/2 weeks so you get the picture. Quality of the DVD and sound is all very good. Recommended for the lover of this genre.  
 I am a fan of the DK travel guides, and particularly like the color photography that allows readers to visualize the area more than most other travel guides. In reality I would like to give this guide 3.5 stars, but will have to settle for four. The photography is generally good, and the information is generally correct in my experience. This book features some excellent pointers that are especially good for those new to Hawaii. The book has a brief background section on the islands as a whole, and has decent island by island coverage of all the major Hawaiian Islands (certainly all the ones a tourist would visit.)   My only real critique of the book is that with a length of just over 200 pages, it is not terribly complete given the diversity of the Hawaiian Islands. The hotel (and restaurant) listings are generally accurate, but are not complete, resulting in the situation where some fairly well known and sizeable properties are overlooked, which can be extremely annoying if you happen to be booked in one of those properties. This is by far the biggest drawback to this book.  My take on the situation is that this is a good book for finding things to explore further in Hawaii, but when it comes down to detailed planning, I recommend that you consult other guidebooks; I particularly like the Lonely Planet series of guides, which has offerings for all the islands that you will be interested in visiting, albeit with less captivating photography. 
 I have always been a vivid fan of Patty's I have listened to everything from her 1st cd to her last cd and I have to say this cd is one of her best albums yet.. 
 I knew nothing of this book until seeing it on a list of the best novels of the 20th century.  Now, I must agree that A Bend in the River is a fabulous novel.  Though no specifics are named, A Bend in the River takes place almost certainly in Zaire, where the President ("the Big Man") has put down the rebellion and restored order to the country.  Business flourishes, and many rejoice in the promise of the future.  Eventually, however, things take a turn for the worse.  The political climate becomes more repressive, government corruption and poverty abound, and the place becomes a real mess.  The reader experiences this through the eyes of Salim, an Arab-African (more African than Arab) storeowner in the local city.  Salim is a fascinating narrator - his observations can be brilliant and insightful, yet his detachment from the real world is quite striking.  Salim's ability to conceal his emotions from both the reader and himself is also of particular interest.  Readers should not expect an "action" novel - A Bend in the River falls much more along the style of E.M. Forster or Joseph Conrad - but Naipaul's prose is superb.  Feast your eyes on the opening sentence: "The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it."   I understand why this book is so highly regarded.  I have never read a better personal account of the rise and fall of a dictatorial regime, fiction or otherwise.  Naipaul's work makes fantastic modern fiction. 
 The four year old children in my care really enjoyed this book.  I did a lot of introduction  "This is a true story of a boy...etc."   They loved it.  Followed the next day with the actual photos and they couldn't get enough. It was a great intro into science experiments with water 
 It is nice to find a movie that believes that its viewers have an IQ over 60.  Hollywood doesn't make enough of these types of movies.  The movie itself is quite thrilling.  The last half an hour actually has you sitting on the edge of your seat.  I found it to be quite entertaining and well worth checking out.  The acting wasn't the best, but I've most definately seen worst.  It was refreshing for the director to choose several "no name" actors so that we can enjoy the progress of the story and not be distracted by celebrities.  It added a lot of realism to the movie.  The best part about the DVD was the makeing-of feature.  It is amazing how much was done with the lack of technology that Hollywood has now.  It was even interesing how they had killed their monkey.  If you enjoy the movie I highly suggest you check out the feature as well.  It is only half an hour long but I had wished it could have been longer and more detailed 
 I very much agree with philosophy of this text. I think it did a good job of gathering the most important points of acting for film.     It's a short, easy, read, but I think it teaches all the right things 
 Reading a poem by Baudelaire is like sipping chardonnay on the quayside in Paris. Formidable! I always return to this book, and I buy as many translations of it as I can. This one I think is the best. As a poet, Baudelaire was the master of describing the "dark regions" of the human soul. He was the Edgar Allan Poe of poetry. 
 Wendell Jaffe swindled a lot of people out of money and then conveniently disappeared from his boat.  The verdict was suicide, but the insurance company that had sold him a half-million dollar insurance policy is not convinced.  When 5 years passed, the company was forced to pay the premium to Jaffe's wife.  Two months later, a man looking very much like Jaffe is spotted in Mexico.  The insurance company hires private investigator Kinsey Millhone to investigate and she does spot a man who appears to be Jaffe, along with his girlfriend Renata.  They escape Kinsey's surveillance and she returns to California.  Jaffe's son Brian is in big trouble with the police and Kinsey concludes that Jaffe will return to help his son.  As she continues her investigation she becomes acquainted with Jaffe's supposed widow and his two troubled sons.  She also comes in contact with some of her long-lost family, and agonizes over whether she wants to establish a relationship with them, and open up old wounds.  Sue Grafton can be relied on to provide a good read, and this book, although not the best in the series, is no exception 
 Louis Catron is the most highly respected playwriting instructor of our  time, and deserves every ounce of credit playwrights give him.  Rather than  bog us down with poetic inspiration, Catron gives us the structure of a  solid script, in simple and useful language and layout.  The difference  between "playwriting" and "playwrighting" is the bottom  line of Catron's excellent instruction.  For those who prefer writing to  talking/thinking about writing, his books are simply the best 
 We had big expectations for Mo'Nique One Night Stand as we feel she is one of the best, if not the best woman comdedians of our time. Mo'Nigue did not dissappoint. You should definitely put the kids to sleep before popping in this dvd, as she is very obscene and curses alot, although its funny its NOT for kids. She is alot funnier on this special then she is on the "The Parkers". Thats because the doesn't have to watch her mouth, and she can say whatever she wants without having to worry about it being bleeped out and she takes full advantage of that privilege. While on stage she gives it her all as you can tell by the sweat pouring off of her face. Several times during the show she got help from audience members in wiping the sweat off. She loves to make fun of skinny girls and even big girls for that matter. She jokes about everything from her divorce and kids to skinny girls and the rugrats. This dvd would of gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that she stayed to long on talking about her ex husband and kids to long. That got a little tiring. The dvd also would been better if there where some extra features. It would of been funny to see her behind the scenes. In the end it is recommended that you rent this dvd as it is worth seeing at least once. Mo'Nigue is quickly becoming one of the funniest comedians around. If you want to get more laughs from her check her out in the movie Soul Plane. Thanks, **Iblazed.com Leader in hip hop movie reviews.**  
 The book is wonderful, recommends to all. Very good  Geraldo Tavares -Campinas/SP- Brasil 
 The editors of this book add an interesting note at the end on the subject of the translation of the text. They point out that the sayings of Jesus contained in the book represent a 'paraphrase' since the principal of 'dynamic equivalence' was followed in producing their work. They do not seek a word-for-word translation but rather an overall meaning. Many scholars may be turned off by this approach 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read! It will transport you back through the years. You will become part of the story. I first read this book years ago and I still find myself returning to it again and again. It never grows old. It is such a sincere, honest, although at times, difficult story of life and all it's struggles and triumphs. Don't miss it 
 This is a fun film, Damon does a great job, the plot line makes sense (in a spy novel sort of way), and the action scenes are great.  It's a nice follow-up to the first Bourne film.  But it has NOTHING to do with the Ludlum book of the same name.  Ludlum's book is all about Chinese politics, Hong Kong chase scenes, and Bourne's wife and psychiatrist.  The movie is a completely different story about Germany, Russia, and a CIA mole 
 Though difficult at times to read, it was a story that managed to get the main scenes and ideas across.  The descriptions Maria McCann uses were stunning, and made it as if you were really there with Jacob.  The plot was wonderful; the twists--breathtaking.  I had never read something so thrilling till I picked up this book.  The scenes between Christopher and Jacob seemed to build up my interest.  It was erotic--sexy, but I thought Maria McCann could have added more to it.  Yet, the author intended it to be more than just a homosexual love story..  And this is definetly not your average love story.  
 The book cover it all. The information is dated, but if your building a Chevy using used cast iron parts this is the book for you. If your building an 8000 + rpm screamer, get this book!! There is a lot of theory and Bills advice on what to do and what not to do. A big section on camshaft theory too.  Hopefully the reissue the book... mine is totally worn out 
 Modern philosophy would have it that the world is meaningless: disputing this contention is A MEANINGFUL WORLD: HOW THE ARTS AND SCIENCES REVEAL THE GENIUS OF NATURE, examining the purpose in life and the universe. Very highly recommended reading, co-authors Benjamin Wiker and Jonathan Witt provide informative and illustrative examples from literary sources, the sciences, and the arts alike which are then blended to support an argument that the universe has importance beyond human endeavors.

 I admit that I never heard of Richard Laymon prior to reading this novel.  I actually bought the book hoping to get something with more of an ancient Egyptian "feel" to it.  However, I found myself unable to put this book down once I started it!  Thrills, chills, and a bit of eroticism add up to one good read.  I can't wait read more Laymon!  
 This movie was made in 1963, if anyone tries and judge movies from 1963 by todays standards they typically think the movie is boring and slow moving. The movie is based on a true story, there is a book you can read if you want more detail. You probably have more great actors (James Garner, Charles Bronsan, McQueen, Attenborough, Coburn, etc) in this one movie than you have combined in all hollywood today.  Today is all special effects, blood and guts and the more brutality the better.  Imagine any movie today with no cursing, would not get past the screening room.  Listen to Richard Attenborough classify all the Germans as one enemy, does not differentiate between SS and Gestapo.  We are at war with ALL of them, not just the SS.  Teenagers drive todays movie market and there a few movies which can keep their attention if there are no special efects.  This movie is an adult movie, plain and simple. The motorcycle scene is awesome.  I think Steve McQueen did most of it.  Richard Attenborough is one tough guy in the movie, you do not have to be steroid pumped up to be tough, you can be tough with your mind.  The music score is great, scenery is great, actors great and it is an entertaining movie.  I really have tried to tell that I enjoyed this movie and it is a good movie. Remember this movie is made only 16 or so years after WWII 
 I have to agree that this is a great book.  I bought it in my second season of trout fishing and I have used many of the outlined strategies to catch trout since that time.  I highly recommend it 
 In this book, the author says that just like how we moved from the industrial age to the information age (computerization), now we are moving from the information age to a new era called "conceptual age". With the effects of globalization and abundant wealth in the western world (especially in US), there will be an increased demand for the right brain skills like creativity and empathy. Though it "feels" to be little exaggerated, it is quite interesting and worth reading. 
 The author is a certified, award winning baker who knows that there is more than one way to braid a challah.  Included in this book of oral histories, historical notes, and bread related anecdotes and folk stories, are the best discussions I have read of Jewish bread and challah histories, as well as fascinating recipes.  It is manna min shama-yim.    The book opens with an intro on challah and bread, and an indexed listing of recipes by type of bread (including holiday breads, 6-hour or less breads, crusty breads, flavorful breads, etc.)  This is followed by a chapter on the Genesis of Challah; and a Primer on bread preparation (fermenting, punching, kneading, dividing, proofing, glazing, etc.)  There is even a chapter just for a mixed multitude of challah braids and shapes with step by step braiding photos, including instructions for a hand challah, a shlissel (key) challah, a string of pearls challah, and a ladder challah also.  There are then chapters for bread recipes of the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, North African, Near Eastern, and New Tradition Jewish people.  Among the best recipes are ones for -- Ashkenazi: Czernowitzer Challah, Guatamalen Challah (with cardamon), Russian Challah, a ring challah, a Lithuanian Challah (no eggs, low sugar), bagels, a babka, rye bread, Lekach honey cake, and Hungarian Makos; Sephardic: Churak of Rhodes, Greek Rolls with Zante currants, Salonika style country bread, Pande Calabazi Pumpkin Bread, and Roscas with cloves; North African: Ethiopian Bereketei Sabbath Bread, Moroccan Purim Bread (chubzei), some Muffleta just for Mimouna, and Egyptian Rarifal Rarif; and Near Eastern: Iranian Barbari, various pitas, Azerbaijani Noon, Bukharan Nooni, Yemeni Kubana, Lachuch, and Samneh 
 J-Ro , Tash and E-Swift rip tha mic! CLASSIC! If you a real hip hop head you must have it 
 Ishmael Reed has continued to inform young and old folks how not to "forget" where it all belongs.  This work melts the '60's and '70's to the new millenium.  It's all about "where it REALLY is!"  Don't ever forget from whence you come and where you are GOING 
 Comprehensive, "user friendly", and superbly organized, The Absolute Beginner's Guide to iPod and iTunes quite literally provides neophytes with easy access to all the informtion any dedicated music fan could possible need in order to get the most out of this new wave of digital music tools whether utilizing a Windows or Mac platform. From the basics of audio CDs, to advanced customizing of music on an iPod, Brad Miser's The Absolute Beginner's Guide to iPod and iTunes nicely equips even those who have never explored digital audio to master their digital music using these tools. If you have an iPod or iTunes, then this 408-page compendium is the ultimate reference for you 
 My son is almost 4 and received this as a gift for Christmas.  He absolutely loves playing with it and his mom and dad like playing the more difficult version on the other side of the cards 
 it's impossible not to become addicted to it.  It's a fantastic cd by a truly remarkable voice.  If you're just now discovering this artist buy both of his releases...you have a lot of catching up to do! 
 My 8- and 10-year-old children and I LOVED this book.  I read it aloud, and we all enjoyed the story -- so much so that we decided to extend our learning to some research of sheep, raising sheep, and sheep farming.  I highly recommend this book 
 If you don't already have an earlier edition,  this book is a must for any shooter,  collector,  or student of the history of firearms.  Since 1965,  Cartidges of the World has been the most comprehensive readily available source of information on the history,  uses,  and performance of rifle,  handgun,  and shotgun cartridges.  This new edition includes dimensions,  illustrations,  a short history,  and sample loading data for each of over 1500 different cartridges,  including virtually every significant cartridge introduced since the early 1870s,  with separate chapters on rimfires,  shotgun shells,  sporting rifle cartridges  from the United States and Canada  (with separate chapters for modern and obsolete), Britain,  and Europe,  plus handgun cartridges (both modern and obsolete),  military cartridges,  and limited production  "wildcat" and "proprietary" cartridges.  Covers calibers from 0.1 inch to 0.95 inch,  and cartridges as up to date as the 460 S&W Magnum, the 204 Ruger,  and the 338 Federal  (but not the 475 Ruger).  If the book has a weakness  (except for a few dimensional typos in tables and a totally incorrect photograph of an obscure British cartridge),  it is in its omission of many 17 and 20 caliber wildcat and proprietary calibers;  it covers interesting but uncommon  cartridges in 10, 14, and 19 caliber, whose future is problematical at best,  and almost all the new 50 caliber long-range target cartridges,  but ignores roughly half of the much more common 17 calibers,  and all but one of the  dozen or so increasingly popular 20 calibers.   (For these,  see Todd A. Kindler's The Sensational Seventeens  and The Terrific Twenties.) 
 I was sorry to finish this, as there was no more to read. You know the feeling: A book creates an entire world so well that you feel like you're being evicted when there's no more left to read. Books can't manage this without being long, epic and well done. "The Company" succeeds on all accounts.  "The Company" follows a group of CIA employees over the course of lives and careers paralleling and embodying the entire Cold War. And the Cold War's epic novels must necessarily focus, like this one, on spies. Because in the shadows is where this war mostly got fought over nearly half a century. Littell writes one of the few novels showing the spy game actually playing out, as it did, over decades.   We meet young spooks Jack McAuliffe, Leo Kritzky, and Ebby Ebbitt as they join the "Company" (or, to insiders in those days, "The Pickle Factory") in 1950. The Cold War is heating up with real combat about to break out in Korea amid worries that Western Europe may topple into Communism. Kritzky goes to work in the agency's Washington headquarters, while McAuliffe and Ebbitt are posted in Europe on the front lines. McAuliffe goes to work for the already legendary Harvey Torriti, "the Sorcerer", the rough-and-tumble, heavy-boozing Berlin bureau chief and the complete opposite of the three Ivy League rookies. Berlin is the epicenter of the early Cold War, with defections, penetrations and kidnappings back and forth across a city divided by power but not yet a wall. Ebbitt works elsewhere in West Germany, trying to insert agents behind the Iron Curtain to foment revolt. But too many ops are blown, sending to their deaths brave emigres who had trusted the CIA with their lives. The legendary James Jesus Angleton hunts for a mole among the British; history buffs know, of course, who it is. After Kim Philby's defection, though, he is replaced by a mysterious agent code-named SASHA, managed by the brilliant but perverted KGB spymaster Starik. Angleton, slipping into paranoia as the game's levels of deception mount, turns the Company upside down trying to find the mole.  Through the eyes of the spooks, and the women in their lives, we see Berlin, the failed Hungarian 1956 uprising, the Bay of Pigs, the secret world of American Communists, Afghanistan and the failed right-wing coup against Gorbachev in 1991 that sealed Soviet Communism's demise. The episodes involving the first three particularly bring a tremendous amount of detail to bear on a period now receding into history. Littell captures so well the flavor and tension of the times. He even brings some sympathy to bear on his Communist agents, who give up normal lives and human connections to live underground and fight their idealistic but misguided war for the triumph of socialism. And he shows the moral dilemmas involved in fighting this kind of war - a tension still felt today in the War on Terror. Through his characters' eyes we see, on one hand, the perils of fighting as dirty as our enemies do, but on the other hand, the moral and real costs of betraying foreign surrogates by failing to back them up.      Littell does a magnificent job of plausibly placing his characters close to turning points of the Cold War, tying it all together and resolving it within the contexts of their lives. For spy or historical fiction buffs, this book is as good as it gets.

 Wuthering Heights is a surprisingly modern novel given that its authorship predates our modern understanding of psychology.  Like many modern novels, Ms. Bronte has also explored the darker side of human passions and psyches more thoroughly than the sunnier side.  Heathcliff will remind you of classic characters whose lives were twisted by fate like Captain Ahab in Moby Dick, Erik in Phantom of the Opera, Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and the mysterious prisoner in The Man in the Iron Mask.  If there were ever two star-crossed lovers who have captured the world's imagination since Romeo and Juliet, they must be Catherine and Heathcliff.  Yet, unlike, many such pairs, their unhappiness is heavily influenced by themselves.     As you contemplate their story, you are constantly drawn to the thought, "what if" thus and such had occurred differently?  That's part of the great power of the story because it has so many unexpected twistings and turnings.  A reader's expectations from a love story are turned upside down, sideways and diagonal from where those expectations normally rest.  As a result, you'll probably decide this isn't a love story after all . . . but a tragedy.  Taken from that perspective, you'll find yourself hearing echoes of Lady Macbeth and King Lear as you contemplate what occurs when the natural order is disturbed.  Few English authors since Shakespeare have captured that sense of what can happen when the universe is disarranged.  What's great about this story?  It's pretty simple:  Emotional intensity in the writing; deeply memorable characters; doomed lovers; and a haunting glimpse at unshakeable obsession.    What's not so great?  The story development itself is pretty awkward.  Much of the story is told in flashback which steals power and immediacy from the narration.  If ever a story cried out for being told in the first person (by Heathcliff, Catherine, Edgar Linton, Hareton and young Catherine), it's Wuthering Heights.  The transitions from one key moment to another are often very abrupt.  Sometimes it is 150 pages later before you get the full sense of what Emily Bronte meant to convey in some of those transitions.    What's less than great?  The characters aren't nearly as appealing as those you'll usually find in a novel dealing with these issues.  In that sense, the novel is more realistic than fictional . . . which helps create some of its immense power.  It's probably a worthwhile price to pay.  Whatever you think of Wuthering Heights, you owe it to yourself to read one of the most moving tales that has ever been written.  Pick a time when you're feeling reasonably happy to start the book.  Otherwise, you may find your mood to be more than a little darkened for a few days.         
 Great programming doesn't get stale with age, it only gets better.  This season is excellent, and in my opinion is much better with Jimmy Smits, than with David Caruso.  Shame on you David, you quitter. I'm glad your big Movie Career failed.  Your supporting staff did not deserve your arrogance.  Jimmy Smits is a wonderful actor, and equally compliments the harshness of Dennis Franz.  The storyline is excellent.  I miss seeing "more" of Gail O'Grady in this season, but that's okay.    Great writing in this series and particulary in this season.  Two thumbs up!!!  EDIT: What is the deal, whenever somebody mentions "John" the PAA, who takes the place of Mrs. Abondonza, the person asks: "John Kelly,?" the David Caruso character.  That guy will just not go away.  What a schlep?  Is that some type of inside joke by the writers?  MC Whit 
 Even though this album was no up to par according to many musical sources, It was a great concept album which still sold 2.5 million worldwide. These rookies that are posioning the music industry couldnt do that in there sleep.  Mariah is a veteran and a true artist. She knows how to adapt to the times, and delivery emotion and fun in her music.!! 
 I'd get this album today if I wanted to, because this group just tore it up in '91 and much of '92 with songs from this debut!  The three ballad hits, Forever My Lady (the jam!), Stay, and Come and Talk To Me have modern new jack touches, but are steeped in the classic R&B style of past groups.  They were smart to place the smoother ballads first.  The second half of the dance numbers are good; there are a few missteps, but the ballads still are the group's strongest suit.  K-CI still is one of the best male singers from the '90s and it has helped in he and his brother's duo albums.  The songs that Al B. Sure, Devante Swing and others produced on this album are very superb!  Devante's songs stand out from many of the others! I hope that Jodeci considers recording a new album in the future.  It would be another hit for them if they did it! 
 A Fine Balance was brilliant, but it was also wrenching, a completely tragic book. In Family Matters, Mistry follows a Parsi extended family and their struggles with caring for a disabled father, seeking to make ends meet in modern-day Bombay. In the course of the book's events, we see flashbacks into the father's troubled life and how it shaped the current situation. This engaging family drama isn't quite as wrenching or tragic as A Fine Balance, but it resonates deeply.   Although I would have liked to get to know a few of the characters better, many of them are well-developed, fascinating people, motivated the frustrations and fears and angers that resonate with all of us. The patriarch is a kind, well-intentioned man who has made all kinds of mistakes; his son-in-law loves his family but constantly loses his temper at them. These characters feel real, and I wish I knew what happened to them "after the novel," always a signal to me that an author has successfully touched me emotionally. (I remember feeling that way about Tom Joad at the end of The Grapes of Wrath.)   In the course of this fine novel, Mistry succeeded in angering me, frustrating me, and comforting me. The book didn't draw me in quite as well as A Fine Balance, but the journey was also a little bit less painful 
 Hip and positive without being obvious, adults will smile at the illustrative details (a lobster bib on an ape, the puckered lips of an old frog) while children lose themselves to the characters. The story educates if you want it to (the difference between a bull and a cow, the bats who "rarely come out during the day",) and slips in plenty of funny lines that'll make adults laugh while kids don't miss a beat. Top-notch illustration. Reminds me of the unforgettable books of my childhood by Illustrator/Author Etienne Delessert 
 I've enjoyed Rumer Godden's books on many levels for years.  As an Anglophile of long standing, I love the "Britishness" of the culture and people of which she wrote.  I've also loved the quiet intelligence of her books, which never talk down to their readers.  Recently, after dealing with the last illness and  death of my mother, I have found in Godden's writings on faith  comfort and support.  In This House of Brede is her strongest and most complex work, and one I have found particularly valuable during the last few months.  Brede Abbey is a Benedictine monastery in the south of England.  Its nuns are an enclosed community who devote themselves to constant prayer and worship. The nuns are not saints but very human characters who struggle with pain, temptation, and sundry other challenges: physical, mental, and spiritual.  It is comforting to read of their battles and of the faith which sustains them.  Godden wrote beautiful, thoughtful, prose, and in any of her books you will encounter engaging and attractive characters. In This House of Brede is her masterpiece.  
 Despite it making it sound so easy to win in the market, I liked the book. In my opinion the book belongs to the list of better ones on investment advice. Instead of launching into predictions on how the market will behave, or suggesting technology stocks for their fantastic futuristic stories, Lynch offers down to earth advice, though perhaps with down to earth language as well. He finds value in conventional businesses, and he clearly explains why. He asserts that amateurs can be as good or even better than investment professionals as long as they keep their eyes and ears open. One needs to try things (the products of the company whose stock you are interested in) out oneself in order to understand the products' values.  As with any other book on investment the author states things that are downright wrong (why should short-selling be described: "it's more like borrowing with criminal intent"), but his exposition exudes a quality that can only come from having an abundance of experience. I also appreciated his honesty.  Having said this much, what I really got out from the book: 1) one needs to classify stocks and set specific investment objectives for each of them prior to purchase, and 2) "do not pluck the flowers and water the weeds." To elaborate on the latter, I have been selling winners prematurely and waiting for laggards to bounce back to my purchase price in order to avoid loss. A common mistake most likely, but something that would have been left under the blind spot unless I'd seen it articulated 
 This book may seem over-simplified to the consumate business person, but it is filled with parables from an extremely successful gentleman.  It was required reading when I was taking graduate courses.  When people ask about setting up a new business, I recommend this book.    
 Grealy writes like she's your best friend who happens to be incredibly  hip, articulate and smart. Of course, real friends are so unreliable. Read  Grealy's book instead 
 This is a classic! Audrey Hepburn is dazzling with Peter O'Toole and an excellent supporting staff. This will always be a family favorite 
 There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider. 
   A W E S O M E !!!!!!!!!!! ALPINE ALWAYS !!!!!!!! 
 I own this really good set from Rhino and it has many of Bob Wills' classics on it. This set is fine but for the true Western Swing fan like myself I understand that the 11 CD Box Set "San Antonio Rose" from the Bear Family has all 300 of his early recordings along with a 1940 movie with Bob and Tex Ritter and to top it off a hard backed Book. I have purchased many of the Bear Familys great sets including Wanda Jackson, Jimmy Martin, The Louvin Brothers and the 7CD Anita Carter set that ran in price about as high as I can afford to pay (my Connie Smith set was about the cheapest). I would love to have this set from Bear Family but at $300.00 I don't think so. I think that I will stay content with my 2CD Rhino Collection. If anyone out there does happen to have a Bear Family set for sale at an affordable price I am interested!           "Enjoy"   Joe Kopeck / Parkville,Marylan 
 I can't believe anyone gave this less than five stars.  Her earlier work is a bit quirky, but she hits it on the nail here.  The academic world updated and as observant as Kingsley Amis in "Lucky Jim", racial sensitivity examined with humor and precision, great characters... I loved it 
 This is a wonderful CD and one that you yourself find singing to.  We love most of the songs and my children are learning all the words to the catchy little tunes.  Would highly recommend it.  It also helps that we have taken a music class that used a lot of the songs, therefore they are familiar to us 
 John Muir was born in 1838 and at a young age emigrated from Scotland with his family to a Wisconsin farm. He escaped the hard labor of the farm and his father's backward Biblical obsessions by displaying great powers of visualization. From principles learned from books, he whittled and fashioned barometers, thermometers, clocks and other marvels from the barest of materials. But he repudiated his inventive genius, which could have made him rich, after an industrial accident left him temporarily blinded; and he took off for the wilderness to discover plants and the natural world.  This book is a journal account of Muir's finding a place for himself in Yosemite after some dangerous wandering through the hazards of reconstruction in the South after the Civil War. It's a book of discovery. Although flocks of sheep like Muir's employer's were allowed to overrun backcountry meadows, and gold miners had ripped apart the lower river beds, the Sierras then were still a place that had many aspects that had not yet been explored or understood. The backcountry was much more vulnerable to exploitation (though in many ways less endangered) than today, but there was freer and unfettered access for one who sought out it's mysteries and wanted to learn. This book shows Muir's powers of visualization in his beginning to formulate the role that glaciers play in the formation of  the landscape. No one at that time had come to a solid understanding of what had made Yosemite Valley. And, although it might seem quite clear in retrospect, it took a strong mind of one who up until that time had been adrift in the world, a wanderer who studied plants, to visualize his theories and make them known to the world.  Anyone who has not experienced the Sierra first hand cannot really appreciate this book. There are lengthy and numerous descriptions of plants and animals, loving descriptions in Muir's fashion, that can only be understood by one who has reveled in the same places and likewise wants to examine all the details. It's not a purely intellectual appreciation. It's something felt with the whole body, with all the senses alive. Muir always writes of being drawn into Nature, of never turning back, as in the case of his foolhardy venture to the brink of Yosemite Falls, "I therefore concluded not to venture farther, but did nevertheless". There's also this kind of breathless anticipation of tomorrow- if only I will be given a chance to explore its fountains.. 
 Usually sequels are not as good as the original films they follow...one need only think of,say"Jaws"to get this point..But with "The Two Jakes"the sequel to"Chinatown"the sequel is every bit as good as the original...The film follows the main charecter from "Chinatown",detective Jake Gittes,who has a new and disturbing case that has threads reaching back into time and inter-connecting with the original plotline..Many of the stars from the original reprise thier roles,most notably Jack Nicholson,who also directed..At the time of its original theatrical release the critics were not kind to the film,or to the director/star...Perhaps this was to have been expected,inasmuchas "Chinatown"ranks high on the list of"Best ever"films.. on the other hand most professional film critics are not only herd animals,who too often follow one another's lead like dogs sniffing each other's rear ends but have little regard for what the public thinks..if one or two"Famous"critics get a bug up thier backsides about a film it is a sure bet that the rest,afraid of being contrary,.will follow suit..also,having to sit through films of all sorts make these people jaded...they expect novelty,and are disappointed by stories,direction,acting,ect that the rest of us find quite entertaining...And most professional critics seem to find the most obscure,often foreign films to be spectacular,while most normal people do not,as if cutting edge films about,say,three men who have hernias and like bowling together on friday nights offers the very zenith of acting and film-making achievement... So forget what the professional critics might have thought about"The Two Jakes",it was a dandy film...You won't be disappointed.. 
 Our three year-old son loves this book!!  He's learned all the words by heart.  He's had to check it out at the library over and over.  We've decided that we have to buy it for him.  
 Folks, don't expect Shakespeare here. This is not (nor do I think it was intended to be) a comedy filled with depth or messages to or about the black community, etc. It's just a pleasant, loosely connected "story" (series of vignettes is more accurate) about Latifah and her friends at an Atlanta (actually, just the exteriors were filmed there and a scene in a park) beauty shop with a lot of amusing moments thrown in for good measure. Latifah pulls it off with her strong personality and the actress who plays her 12 year old daughter is one to watch for, but as for the often stupid supporting characters (this is not one of Alfre Woodward's better moments) and crazy antics that don't always make sense- just relax and leave your brains at the door while you pick up a cool one and laugh after a hard day's work.   At a recent academy awards ceremony, Chris Rock lampooned black movies like this and Barbershop and said "What's next- a movie called "laundromat?' Careful Chris, don't give them any ideas 
 Beautiful music, intelligent lyrics, what more could you ask for. I first heard this album at the tender age of 14 (I am almost 30 now) while I was working at a music store. One of my coworkers was obsessed with this album and kept playing it in the store. After awhile I realized I was singing it at home and school, and I bought myself a copy.   I love music, and own an uncountable number of CDs. But I think I can safely say THIS CD is my favorite of them all! The lyrics are intelligent and elegantly crafted, the music is moving. Galileo (with it's make you think factor) is my favorite song on the CD, with a romeo and juliet coming in 2nd for it's humor factor. Ghost can make you feel emotions stir at your very core if you have ever lost a lover. After 16 years of hearing Ghost, it can still make me cry.  This CD is great for taking in the car, especially on long drives. Do yourslef a favor and get this one. 
 "Cabinets" is a wonderfully creepy scientific thriller.  I especially enjoyed the well-researched historical NYC anecdotes, which don't detract from the scary plot but make it seem more believable.  This is one of those books you finish in one sitting---simply because you can't put it down!  Highly recommended 
 I have read all of Austen's novels except Northanger Abbey, and I found this one to be in the top three, along with EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (my personal favorite).  This book is very unique compared to her other masterpieces.    Let's begin with a summary.  Anne Elliot fears life as an "old maid" as she reaches the age where most women during the pre-Victorian era are supposed to be married.  She regrets not marrying the one man she truly loved, Captain Wentworth.  At the time, he was not considered suitable.  Now almost seven years later, Wentworth returns, having made his fortune and is now considered a fair prospect.  Now every girl is fawning over the strong, sea worn Captain Wentworth.  Emotions Anne thought she could never feel again overpower her.  Despite her attempts to control her emotions, she realizes that there is no man she could even consider marrying over him.  The question now is does he feel the same way?  This is a page turning novel that you just keep reading wondering if Anne and Wentworth will ever get it together.    I found this novel so different in a good way for many reasons.  First, there really isn't any fair leading lady or dashing young man.  Anne Elliot, I believe, is Austen's most realistic character.  Don't get me wrong EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE fans, I love Emma and Elizabeth and admire them for all their characteristics.  However, I find myself wishing I was them rather than relating to them.  I loved how Anne was quiet, but beautiful and witty at the same time.  She also is very proper and doesn't really know how to compose herself in front of the man she loves.  She is too influenced by what other people think, like many of us.  I personally loved reading about a character who I myself can relate to in many ways.  Yes, Anne is flawed but she's real.    Second is the eternal question that haunts us all when crossed in love....does he feel the same way?  Austen was an early psychologist of her time and really understands human behavior.  I loved how Anne (and Wentworth as we find out in the end) really is fearful of getting hurt and really doesn't know what to do with herself.  It's just so real and life like and I guess she gets lucky because of the ticking clock with Wentworth, but I believe it provided hope for those during Austen's time and now who are faced with the same problem.  I loved how Austen wrote about this which I think really kept me reading the book.    Well, I could spend all day talking about this book, but basically I'm saying read it, it's not quite as long and detailed as Austen's other works but strong at the same time.  Enjoy! 
 Dr. Trees does an amazing job of providing insight into the true characters of our founding fathers, and humanizes the seemingly distant figures in a delightfully elegant fashion. This book is a true work of art! Bravo 
 This book is GREAT!!! it was my first book about radical islam and those followers of islam...really interesting.  Plot is typical good looking American Hero falls in love with good looking American She-ro...but the information on the mindsets of these islamic radicals is right on!  I spent three years if the Marines and I was over there in the mid-1970's...and I guess time marches on for everyone "EXCEPT" these people who would rather live in the "STONE-AGE" mentality full of misguided hate and ignorance than pulling their heads out of the sand and looking reality smack-dab-in-the-eyes!!!!  I'm in the process of reading three more of these books about the balony that islam is spreading, and it really blows your mind away!  I just have to try to remember what they say about some profiling of stereotypes: They are 99.7% accurate, and that's why they are called stereotypes!!!!  THIS BOOK KICKS SOME ISLAMIC BUTTOX AND GETS YOU THINKING.  I LITERALLY GOT ON-LINE FIVE MINUTES AFTER FINISHING THIS BOOK AT 0300 HOURS AND ORDER THE NEXT BOOK FROM AMAZON!!!!  HAPPY READIN 
 Zora Neale Hurston's most famous novel, and now a TV movie thanks to Oprah, this is an amazing look at the lives of African American Women post-Reconstruction. The novel follows Janie and her journey from teenage bride, to shopkeepers wife, to a cradle robbing, free spirited woman. The novel is set in Eatonville, Florida, the first black community in America. I learned so much about life in the South and the struggles that Black women faced 
 I really enjoyed how honest the book is regarding the creative process.  I've always liked Nancy Crow's work and have really liked knowing how she came to do her work.  Excellent resource 
 What a year 2005 has proven to be.  Matisyahu broke through in a major way, but two of the most interesting new Jewish acts also released albums this year: Balkan Beat Box and Latino-Jewish collective Hip Hop Hoodios.  Gone are the schmaltzy, lame stereotype acts like 2 Live Jews and 50 Shekel.  In their place have arrived new acts that represent the true cultural tapestry of Jewish culture.  I really enjoy the Balkan Beat Box concept - it's all over the place, and they put on an amazing live show (especially the one at Irving Plaza).  Likewise, I discovered Hip Hop Hoodios through their video "Gorrito Cosmico" on MTV Espanol - never did I think an openly Jewish act could make it in the Latino community.  So let me say, if you are an open-minded Amazon shopper, pick up the Balkan Beat Box album and also grab Hip Hop Hoodios "Agua Pa' La Gente" while you're at it.  Shalom!!  
 I just wanted to take the time to review this book since it is a gift I give to so many friends of mine. Years ago I was introduced to the Artist Way. I absolutely loved it. As a creative women in the arts with tons of ideas. I needed a way to organize and filter through them. This book is like an organizational course to your creativity. Doing the morning pages everyday made me so clear. I was able to get through all the extra stuff and hit the core everyday. From it I really organized my life and made a time line for creative projects I had in my head. One of them being putting voice lessons on CD, "Voice Lessons To GO". Following through with a creative project was such an incredible feet for me. Not allowing myself to hold myself back. I got a lot of my clarity from The Artists Way. I have more projects on the way as well. I absolutely loved the idea of Artist dates. It allows you to take time with yourself seriously. This is without a doubt the best self help book I have come across 
 Two grandsons (4 years and 6 years)have truly enjoyed this cartridge. Recommend it highly! 
 My kids love Dr. Suess's books. This is one of their favorites, and mine. It's silly but what fun! Recommended for parents who like to read to their young children 
 This oversized book has dovoted 2 pages to each important artist from the 1400's to Jackson Pollock.  As with all D-K books, the reproductions are wonderful and the information is fascinating.  The arthor gives a mixture  of facts about the artist's life, painting of the period, key works of the  painter, and other events happening in the world at the time.  I love this  book 
 This is the 2nd best Mo Thugs album (in my opinion), behind "IV: The Movement". My favourie tracks are "Searchin' For Peace", "Ghetto Bluez", "Mo' Murder", "Ain't No Reason", "Welcome To My World", "Thug Devotion", "Playa In Me", "No Pretender", "Rumours & War", "II Tru", "Low Down" & "Family Scriptures" 
 I've read the play and watched the movie many times. While there are differences, they are both, to put it in a British way, jolly good! I never tire of the people who populate this play/movie. Lady Gertrude's "high moral standards and high ideals" are delightful, Sir Robert is an ideal husband, despite his past, the exchanges of wit between Miss Mable and Lord Arthur keep me laughing long after I've turned off the TV or laid down the book and Mrs. Chevely is splendidly evil. It brings a smile and, if you're so inclined, maybe a tear, too. An Ideal Husband is well worth owning so you can grab it whenever you feel like taking a dip into the grand London "Season" of 1895 
 I came across this book at the recommendation of an Orthodox nun, who wanted to give me an idea of what cloistered life is like, how nuns live and struggle, and are basic human beings - just like everyone else.  Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down, and devoured it almost in one week!  I enjoyed reading it so much, that once I'd finished, I turned it to the beginning and started reading it again! (My family thought I was nuts as I sat reading it whilst sitting on the beach.  When they asked me why I was reading it for a second time, I exclaimed I didn't have anything else with me, to which my Dad just rolled his eyes and said, "I could have given you the newspaper!")  I'd chose Brede over the newspaper any day.  This is a charming book, whose characters are very realistic.  The interwoven stories are compelling, and it makes one sad when you read the last page.  If only there was a continuation, a sequel - what happened to Dame Phillipa once she left?  "Where did she go?" you ask?  I'll leave that to your imagination - unless you read the book for yourself.  You will thoroughly enjoy the story regardless of who or what you are, whether Christian or not.  I can guarantee it will remain in your memory and heart for years to come.  Happy reading, dear people! 
 First thing I have to say is what great scientific imagination for a book written in the late 1800's. I mean they didnt even have cars yet and Mr. Wells is writing about partical beams and biological warfare. 2nd is I was actually surprised at how much the recent movie used from the book. I didnt care for the movie as much as I did the original version but it was much more faithful to the book than I'd ever imagined. If you your a fan of either of the two movies or just want a very good sci fi book to read I highly recommend this book. The language at times is dated being written at the turn of the century but it's still a quick and easy read. 
 Gaelic storm is one of those bands, that you just have to see to get the full experience. I saw them in Milwaukee for Irish Fest and I can't get enough. They are so personable and approachable. They don't hesitate to get on tables and dance with you or come out in the audience and sing along. Their music is fun and authentic but more, they are the kind of people that you can hang around and talk about life with. Ya just got to love 'em 
 After having surgery and nearly losing my life I somehow managed to get my hands upon this book.(this was the second book I read after surgery)I became one with the main character in the story and as he recovered I recovered from a parallel point of view...looking back now at the time I read this book,almost two years ago,it does bring back memories,not just my painful memories,but the ones written in the story.At one point in time the pain in the book or more accurately Johnny's pain was the same as mine.That is how great the story is...it has that power over the  reader...     Anyway,enough about me,the basic thing about the story is this,actually I would be lying if I said that,but for simplicity sake I have to put it this way...After having an accident  and recoving from a coma,Johnny was left with the ability to know things from a psychic's point of view.This story is not simply about that however,with the coma he has lost alot,though five years might not seem alot,but he did.The story deals with more than one characters and makes their information known well.This book has so many things about it that it is difficult for me to explain,for me to do that would mean for me to write down the whole book for you!But I leave you with this,The book is great,and I highly recommend it,the ending is sad though,but promising...at some times in the story I forgot about reality and started to live in the book,which seemed like reality to me.Putting things together in this book can remind us of how SK takes everyday situation and magnify them for us to see them for what they really are...This book is not too long,so you wouldn't get bored reading it,everything is perfect in this book,I have no complains...enjoy...Nigel.  I have specially included this "clipping" from the internet,to help you to understand the story a little better and to help you to make a good decision about buying the book...Here goes... (Taken from wikipedia)  "The Dead Zone tells the story of Johnny Smith, a small-town high school teacher from Castle Rock, Maine who is tragically injured in a car accident that leaves him in a coma for almost five years. When he recovers, he is heartbroken to learn that the world has moved on without him. His girlfriend, Sarah, has married another man and has a child, his mother has succumbed to religious mania, and Johnny sustained brain damage. The damaged part of Johnny's brain, his "dead zone", is somehow connected to his capacity for visualization, as well as processing addresses and numbers. As though to compensate, his brain activated a long-dormant part of the mind relating to how humanity processes touch, resulting in the psychic ability to touch certain people and objects and experience visions of the past, present, and, most frequently, the future. Because of his "dead zone", parts of each vision remain unclear to Johnny, forcing him to figure out certain things as he goes along. The full extent of what he must do, or whatever tragedy he must try to avert, is seldom clear to Johnny.  Johnny uses his newfound ability to save a young girl's life, help Castle Rock sheriff George Bannerman identify serial killer Frank Dodd, and save several teenagers from a disastrous fire. Despite his heroism, Johnny considers his power a curse rather than a gift and is loathe to use it, longing for his old life. At a political rally, Johnny shakes hands with Greg Stillson, a popular but unconventional Congressional candidate from New Hampshire. Johnny sees a vision of Stillson being sworn in as President many years in the future, and of apocalyptic devastation so terrible and complete that he feels compelled to prevent Stillson's rise to power at any cost.  Johnny learns that he is dying of a brain tumor caused by his coma, and is forced to take desperate action. He tries to assassinate Stillson before his vision can come true, but the attempt fails. At the crucial moment, Johnny is unable to fire his gun; his in-built refusal to kill is too strong. When the bullets begin fly, Stillson attempts to use a small boy as a human shield, and a news photograph of the candidate cowering behind a child ruins his political career."  Thanks..........enjoy...............Nigel. 
 I just bought this book last Friday at Barnes and Noble at Jefferson Pointe.  When I saw this book and realized what a wealth of information it could contain (regarding weapons, fighting techniques, and Conan himself), I knew I had to have it at that moment. So I grabbed it and bought it. I really haven't gotten into the in-depth reading yet, but I'll get there. But from what I have read, it is an awesome book and an essential companion for all Conan fans 
 I am a resident of Central New York and this story was very well known to everybody in these parts.If your reading this you probally have read some of the other reviews so I`ll be brief.This is an incredible film,you are taken to a place that exists and people that are exactly what you see...its almost like travelling back to the turn of the century when you visit the Ward farm.The Ward brothers were indeed considered outsiders by some locals but they,ultimately,were a genuine thread that made up the fabric of this community and after Delbert is charged with his brothers murder and when the people sensed a railroading by a politically minded D.A.,they rally to Delbert`s defense.It is a unique look at small town America...from its citizens,its lifestyle and its politics. The film is sometimes funny,disturbing and even uncomfortable at times but it is as powerful an experience as you could ever have.Like another documentary I have seen - Sunshine Hotel....about flophouses on the Bowery in New York City - it pulls no punches and hits hard....gritty and bold it will resonate long after its final credits have rolled 
 My nieces (8, 2 and 1 y/o) and I watch this movie everytime we get together.  There are some moments in the movie that are meant for entertaining the adults who watch these movies with their children.  But the humor is just that...adult...and way over the children's heads.  If you are worried about the movie get it and watch it first.  Then decide if it is appropriate for your children.  We love it 
 We have been to Sicily three times and find the Rough Guide to be  unerringly on target.  Its assessments of the priority of things to see and  do, its reviews of sights, hotels, restaurants have been the most helpful  of the many guides we used.  Short on color photos but long on info, the  rough guide let us find the beauty quickly to see and taste it for  ourselves, and steered us to many interesting places in Palermo, Patti,  Milazzo, Messina and Syracuse 
 Mary Oliver has written a beautiful collection of 47 poems that shows her love of nature, and really why she does wake early to greet the day.  One of the qualities of her writing that I most enjoyed is that she expresses her intricate love of nature with a joy that lacks sentimentality.  She spends her time determining what she is seeing and hearing and writes about that rather than looking inward to how she feels about everything.  Therefore, her joy and feeling come through in the words she chooses to describe her subjects, and not in a list of subjective feelings.  For me, that made her poetry universal and a communication that I could share in.  I highly recommend this book for both the poetry and nature lover 
 I found this book very informative, I had just finished reading Kevin Trudeau's Natural Cures... This book just verifies what I have heard and read the past few months about toxic chemicals, and explains why I have had allergic reactions my entire life.  This is a must read for anyone interested in living a cleaner, healthier, less-toxic filled life, lots of good home made recipes for cleaning products, beauty products, etc.  Well worth the money and easy reading 
 I read this book years ago and I fell in love with the ideas of Nietzsche.  I think every teenage intellectual goes through an existentialist phase, it fits so well with the pubescent and oncoming adulthood experience.  His theories opened up my mind in a way I never thought it could.  The time for me was one of emense confusion, vacillation and angst. It opened up for me a love of philosophy that has carried through to this day as I prepare to further my education on the subject.  It helped guide me creating myself into a better man and for that this book and his philosophy will always have a certain affection.  Now I have mixed feelings about some of the things that he has written, but this book is incredible.  I am a lover of art and theatre, and as an amatuer playwright this book gave insights that I still find breathtaking.  I have always believed that history is not the story of stone hard facts and dates but the spectrum of human thought, philosophy, art, music, notions, inventions and a constant state of progress and change.  This book is one large key to that spectrum.  I would recommend this to any teenager in a place that I was in or any member of the human race for that matter.  If you love theatre and want to engage in it in any fashion, then you really need to read this book 
 Thank you for the great book, it was better than I thought it would be for my very first used book order online. Thank you so much 
 The movie wasn't great. But, if you want amazing fun music  that moves you and you can dance to, this is one great album. My favorite tracks are: - Dance like this - Guajira (I Love U 2 Much) - Can I Walk By - Satellite - El Beso del Final ("last kiss", in Spanish) by Christina Aguilera - Represent, Cuba - Do You Only Wanna Dance by My 
 A good thriller, that was very Grisham.   Delivered on exactly what you read Grisham for.  
 The negative reviews on this book are way off.  I've read many real estate investing books and most of them talk about all the wonderful deals they've made and how you can do it to... but never give you DETAILS.  Jay gives lot of good information and shows you how to cover your ass so you don't make the mistakes that a lot of R.E. investors make (overpaying, over-estimating income, under-estimating expenses, believing what the sellers say about the income potential.)  I'm just as glad that these reviewers don't follow his advice; more opportunities for those of us that heed it 
 This has to be as complete as a commentary can get. Witherington's translational based socio-rhetorical dissection to understand the intent of meaning is convincing and thought provoking.  His use of extensive 1st century Jewish, historical, pagan, and biographical sources contemporary to Luke to squeeze every drop of  meaning from Scripture is gifted.   I'm dumbstruck to know how any one person or team could compile and matrix so much knowledge. I know of no better material to enable a state of the art understanding of the mechanics of the incredible and incomprehensible Christian emergence into 1st century society, and the miracle that it can be studied today at the fidelity Witherington amplifies. Witherington may be debated in academic circles but it is hard to imagine how effectively a material criticism could be mounted.  I'd be interested in other reader comments in this regard.  This is a monster read and worth it. 
 Beautiful, beautiful pictures and a nice retelling of the Unicorn legend.   But... The book is worth the pictures alone 
 This is an awesome band, and they've realeased an awesome CD. So it's not the most technical stuff. It has atmospehere. But ok, let's bash a band because their music has higher meaning than just cool sounds and constant head bangning. While there are some headbanging tracks on here, a lot of it is about the atmosphere. Somehow this music can sound very depressing but with in the same song gives you a sense of hope. It's a very different sound. Probably an aquired sound 
 Well, what can I say? It's an academic work (read--puts you to sleep), very narrow, that tries to advance the field of current military affairs.  Some chapters, actually, are interesting--especially the first one, where Kaldor describes in good detail her distinctions between old and new wars.   Very briefly, Mary Kaldor (lecturer at the LSE) argues that America--the last nation-state, cannot understand the new era of globalization in conjunction with identity politics (read--ethnic hatred, linguistic identities, or religious) and militarization. And America, and Americans, accd. to Kaldor, still live in the Rumsfeld Cold War mentality, where the world is divided into blocs between democratic and authoritarian-communist regimes, and that the only way to prevail over "evil" is to advance military technology evermore. She says that this is fictitious, at best, and at worse, extremely dangerous.  Old wars are between states, involving a clear distinction between combatants and civilians alike, and are organized vertically, with clear goals and objectives. New wars, on the other hand, begin as civil wars within states, and spill over into adjoining neighbor states, creating a mass diaspora and refugee crisis. In addition, there are mass rapes, civilians are the primary targets (rather than soldiers), genocide is typically the aim, and funding is very different--instead of coming from a vibrant economy, it comes from extortion through insidious taxes on illicit drugs, alcohol, arms weaponry, etc. In short, Kaldor contends that the new wars are those that occurred after the fall of the Berlin Wall (such as those in Eastern Europe, Rwanda, Congo, Sudan, Bosnia, and Iraq 2003). And what has empowered these "super-angry men" (ala Friedman) is globalization. How? Through the cheap weaponry in the global arms trade, the mass proliferation of Kalashnikovs (over 100,000,000 still unaccounted for, accd. to Michael Mann), the internet (facilitating easy communications via IM or email, or temporary web pages), and also, the negative effects of globalization: being excluded from those parts of the world where globalization has not yet included. This goes along the lines with Thomas Barnetts's "The Pentagon's New Map"--namely, draw a circle around those parts of the world that don't benefit from globalization, and you will find failed states, failing states, and mass insurrections.  Kaldor's solution, which in my opinion is grossly nieve, is in implementing a cosmopolitan rule of law by encouraging local police officers to arrest local agents (insurgents, etc.) before they can become too destructive. This is nieve because some people cannot be reasoned with, under any circumstances: see Eric Hoffer's wonderful "The True Believer" for further clarification. People such as Hitler, al-Zarqawi, bin Laden, Pol Pot, etc., are all ideologues, and they were and are unwilling to bend under any circumstances to permit those cosmopolitan forces from rising in the first place. They have to be taken out. Period. And I would add, had I been Kaldor, that one of the ways to deal with these thugs, which as worked so well for us in the past, is through the encouragement of corruption. Corruption is good, it is healthy. If the choice is between killing 50,000 people or bribing the dictator $500M, well, the corrupt leader will take the money. Ideologues will not.  Is Kaldor correct in asserting that our US military is antiquated in their beliefs and strategies? It is hard to say. I think on one hand, she actually is correct because if you look at the results of the Iraqi war now, it looks pretty bleak: daily insurrections, daily bombings, daily murders. There is no clear target, we have no idea who the insurgents are or where they are, and our estimates of them change annually: first there were 5,000 in Oct. 2003, then one year later, from 8,000 - 12,000, and now up to 20,000. In addition, we are using the latest and greatest in military technology to crush opponents that are marginally excluded from society, and weak. Our Abrams tank, for instance, used in Bosnia in 1999 couldn't cross the damn river because there were no bridges strong enough to support the enormous weight!  Clearly there are a proliferation of failed states, or failing states, where ethnic hatred and tension runs high. Look at what is happening in East Timor now.   It's worth the read, and since it's on many academic syllabi around America, I'd say, it has some value to at least have a look.  
 Longtime Japan resident and journalist Robert Whiting's classic book on Japanese baseball is as fresh today as when it was published. The book begins with the arrival of Bob Horner, a 29-year-old bonafide all star who was still in his prime when he arrived to play for the Yakult Swallows. Waiting for him when he landed at Narita Airport were 200 journalists, a team owner who confidently predicted--and expected--that the overweight Horner would hit 50 home runs (Horner was assigned the number 50 on his uniform as a not so subtle reminder), and a year contract worth $2 million. What Horner did not know was how different yakyu (literally, field ball) would be from the baseball he knew in America. The regimentation of Japanese teams, the rules governing many aspects of life both on the field and off--and the adjustment of moving around the world to live in a very different culture--had been and still is the undoing of many players. Whiting's work is about more than baseball and sports; it is about how Japan and Japanese approach things, how that which is imported must first be Japanized. Highly recommended 
 I found this book really useful and could not stop wondering how could so much common sense escape my understanding before? Ms Ryan's advice is pretty obvious, however, here we are doing it wrong once and again. I can't say this book is responsible for me getting or not getting interviews so far, but at least I now feel confident enough to think I'm sending a decent cover letter. If you think that this book is going to make the process of cover letter writing faster and easier, you'll get disappointed since it is rather the opposite. But what has to be done has to be done and at least now you know. I didn't give it 5 stars because it gets too repetitive, full of examples that are great, but as usual, there may be one in twenty (if any) that even resembles one's own situation.   http://diaryofajobhunter.blogspot.co 
 dr. john's 'in the right place' for sure-in my top 10. i listened to this album when it first appeared and am still loving it like it is the first time. definitely a top 10 all time album pick. simply sophisticated without the trappings. no tricks, just great stuff 
 A little heavy on the unfortunate accidents of the main character, but still a great comedy 
 This book is always a classic for kids!  With wonderful pictures & an aasy to follow story it is a great bed time story 
 I got this book to explore ways of managing insect pests without chemicals.  It was a good choice. Most of the book discusses the way plants (and animals) interact.  I found this far more helpful than the standard 'encyclopedic' gardening book which simply lists individual plant characteristics.  The book is an interesting mix of home-remedies and scientific know-how.  Sometimes the prose is a little too optimistic (the author claims 99% of insects are beneficial), but the overall tone encourages an exploratory and confident outlook.  Here are the fundaments of garden health which I found in the book: 1) Bring together a balance of species: plants, insects, birds and animals, in big and small ways 2) Always have some water available of the animal life 3) Always have flowers in bloom since they keep beneficial insects around 4) Keep things changing, rotate planting beds annually  I particularly liked the reference material in the final 100 pages.  There are sections on plants and sections on insects, but each refers to the other.  For example, in the section on corn, we learn that nasturtiums are good companion plants for corn.  Also, we discover that small flowered herbs will attact insects that prey on corn-borer larvae that try to steal the harvest.  In the section on corn-earworms, there are lists of natural insect enemies and plants that will host the good guys while they wait for earworm to prey upon.    Finally, the color photos of the authors blended gardens should inspire everyone 
 The cover of the book brilliantly displays a variation of the game called double exposure, among other names. Both of the dealer's cards are exposed for the players to see. This may seem like a great advantage to the player until you consider that pushes loss. This, along with whatever other restrictions may be placed on the players by the house for knowing what the dealer has, such as doubling only on 10 and 11. Also, when the player has a 19 looking at a dealer's 20 the player will have no choice but to hit a hard 19. Beat the Dealer explains the importance of rule variations. Take it from a dealer, read this book 
 This recipe book provides a great deal of helpful information on alternative lactose free products and what to look for on the label to find lactose, as it may be hidden in some other ingredients.  The recipes are delicious and simple.  There is a wide variety of unique recipes to try.  My husband and I are having the best time with the wonderful ice cream recipes!  This recipe book is a must if you are lactose intollerant or have a lactose restricted diet. The book is well worth the low cost 
 This is a beautifully written and illustrated combination of stories about some real heroes - dogs, their handlers, and their owners.  You'll have tears of sadness at the loss of heroes like Sirius, and tears of joy at the exploits of others like Alette and Bullet.  This is a great book for kids and adults.  What a wonderful tribute to heroes, two and four-footed 
 When I see Suzanne Somers I just see Chrissy from Three's Company and all that snorting and dumb blonde-ing!  I never paid any attention to any of the Suzanne Somers books because I figured this was just another celebrity attaching their persona to something.  My library happened to have this on the shelf and since I had some time to kill while waiting for my daughter to pick out her books I decided to flip through the recipe section since I knew it was a low carb type of diet and I do atkins.  I was very interested at what I saw so I checked it out.  I have been totally shocked at how easy and terrific her ideas are and in fact her philosophy is quite interesting too.  I am really impressed.  I have a totally different viewpoint now of Suzanne Somers.  I love this recipe book so much I had to buy it so I"d have a copy 
 Do you actuallylike to have big helpful arrows pointing you to your bed, A wallpaper print of giant logs in the living room? 3 foot deep shag rug(orange, of corse) in the bathroom? If so, you won't like this book! If not, you'll laugh and wonder along with the author "What were they thinking??" when you read this book, concerning the.. shall we say, quirkier interior design ideas from the 70's. I particlaurly liked the Peter Max decal that dominated all the things in the closet 
 I admired Senator Obama, but I wanted to know more about him.  Now I can only hope that someone with his integrity, values, intellect, honesty, modesty and motivation can lead this country in the future.  I really feel like I know "Barry" and hope I am fortunate enough to hear Senator Obama speak in the near future.  The book has so many story lines 1) Growing up inter-racial, 2) Learning about his African family 3) The influence of grandparents 3) Becoming focused as a young adult after a confusing childhood 4) the life of a community organizer and much more!  I was only sorry it ended when it did 
 As a near autobiography written by a man sitting in a prison cell with a lot of time to think about things, the faults of this book are predictable. If we have any appreciation of human failings, it is unreasonable of us to expect complete honesty and objectivity from a man seeking for himself some understanding re the events he was both caught up in and partly responsible for. Bear this in mind, and many of the failings commonly associated with this book will be of little bother to you. We can no more expect Speer to be 100 per cent honest and accurate about his own life than we can expect ourselves to be honest and accurate about our own.  Naturally, then, when we read an autobiography, we read it for something other than historical objectivity. We want to glimpse events from the author's own eyes, and we hope that perhaps if we read carefully between the lines we will see something of the author that he or she wouldn't have consciously revealed to us. In the case of a man associated with the worst evil in history, we won't tolerate denial or excuses, but we can't expect much more than impersonal details and quiet humility. When I read this book, I was satisfied on these points. He denied little, he never explicitly offered reasons or excuses, and he seldom tried to disassociate himself from events.  So, having addressed these predictable weaknesses, I can now offer the book some praise. It is very well-written and engaging, it is fascinating from a historical perspective, and it is most interesting to read a book on the Nazis written by a man who had been one of the most powerful Nazis of all. If this later point is your reason for reading this book, then you won't be disappointed. How many times in history has someone from so high up in the enemy's hierarchy survived with the writing skills to give us such a thorough look from the inside? From this perspective, we are exceptionally lucky to have this book. Speer may have omitted various points, and he might have been wrong at times, but these failings will be unobtrusive to most people baring the experts, and little can compare with a book that was written by a guy who in many ways was and will forever remain more expert than anyone who was not, like himself, so completely part of it. The book was remarkable for its personal insights on Hitler and much of his entourage. It was also intriguing for Speer's account of his own doings and concerns throughout his story. (In reference to the Allied bombing effort on German cities and munitions' factories, it was something to learn that Speer, as Armaments' Minister, worried more about the problems that raids on humble ball-bearings' factories would cause. Such raids, which never came, may have been decisive given the all-round necessity of these forgotten pearls.) The book is for anyone interested in WWII, and it remains a valued part of my book collection 
 What an excellent idea to chronicle the classic Lee/Ditko issues in one single book. Volume #1 gives us Amazing Fantasy #15, Amazing Spider-Man #s 1-20 as well as the #1 Annual issue. For those of us who wanted to read the early Spider-Man stories but couldn't afford the actual comic books, here's the answer in one book. I only wish there was a color version of this volume but even in black and white, the stories and the artwork don't suffer. 
 Frank at his best, older guy remembering the vintage years of youth. If you like Sinatra, you must have this album 
 My girl will alway be on top in my book. You go Nikk 
 Like the movie this soundtrack is awesome. Its even better than the movie because you can't see some of the bad acting. Still its one of the best cowboy movies of all time and this soundtrack makes it even better 
 Good book with practical advice and gives you an understanding of a kids perspective and what they go through.  A must read for parents with kids who have Asperger Syndrome 
 This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this! 
 This story is about four children whose parents have died and how they make their home in a boxcar.  At the end of the book something very special happens that makes them all very happy.  I think boys and girls would both enjoy this book 
 THE THREE MUSKETEERS and THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO may have started the swashbuckling but with CAPTAIN BLOOD Rafael Sabatini launched it into the twentieth century with a melodramatic flourish and more sea battles than you can shake a peg-leg at. In Peter Blood, he gives us a brooding but honourable hero; a wronged man who takes to piracy because the only other choice is slavery.  Every ingredient you'd expect in a tale of piracy is present and correct; there are pieces of eight and ferocious sword fights; double-crosses and romance; and, of course, there's the triumph of good over evil. Sabatini breezes through the plot - sometimes far too quickly and often without fleshing out his characters sufficiently - and injects it with enough zest to keep you awake until the early hours. But it's the sea battles that mark this out as something special; you can practically hear the timbers creaking, the rigging humming and the cannons booming. It's exhilarating stuff and has you breathlessly turning the pages as thrill follows thrill.   
 I am not embarrassed to say that I needed to read this book and gain the wisdom it has to offer.  Of course, I would have been afraid to admit that prior to reading the book and learning that dealing with fear is nothing to be ashamed of.  How astounding to hear from so many other women, many I have admired for years, about their fears and how they overcame them. Arianna has written an honest and insightful guide that I can see myself returning to many times in the next phase of my life whenever I need another fearlessness boast to propel me forward.  Bless you Arianna for writing this book and getting so many remarkable women to openly tell their stories. A great gift for women 
 Some have complained about the mono mix but for me this makes the set an even more fantastic trip down memory lane.  Sounds like you're hearing it for the first time on a junky portable radio and that's the way I remember most of these songs.  If you have to have the stereo mixes then you can get them in other box sets or on other single cd releases.  Personally, I'd stay away from that sound.  It just couldn't be the same.   One warning for new listeners.  These songs were meant to be played on 45 record players, am radios in cars or on jukeboxes.  The mono sound mentioned above works its real magic in these settings.  You can recreate a lot of the sound by playing these cds in your car but it just doesn't work on an ipod.  None the less this is what made music special when I was a kid and I wouldn't trade the sound for stereo for a million bucks 
 I've had DVD players come and go, so its kinda cool to have a gaming console that plays dvd's too.  Yeah, I know the PS2 has that capability without a remote, I have one of those too.  But one of the cool things I noticed about the X Box playback kit is that the remote looks just like the ones made by RCA. I tried a few of the controls on the DVD funtion of my RCA universal remote, low and behold it worked.  Kinda a hand thing, I've got to many remotes floting around as it is, so that part was nice.  Mine works great, I use it instead of having to re-arrange my already overpacked entertainment center to put in my other DVD player.  
 I really am finding this book to be chocked full of valuable information on gettings ones art career in motion. I recommend this one for anyone thinking of moving past the hobby stage of their career 
 A political science professor of mine lent this book to me when I was batting around ideas for a term paper. I enjoyed this book for what it is and it doesn't claim to be the comprehensive body of knowledge on China's culture, history, politics and contemporary society. If you want that, spend your entire life in college studying it, but don't expect it from a book of this size.  This book is a wonderful tool for those who have a "beginner's interest" in China. This book inspired me to not only conduct my own research but to also read both broader and deeper into China's politics and history.   What is fascinating about this book is how much the author is able to cover. It's a very dense book full of information. If you're looking for insight and analysis, you might find it scattered between the paragraphs that have been well-researched.   One could easily know the necessary facts of Chinese culture and history after reading this book. It is also an accessible and well-organized book. I've used in research and it has helped to direct me to other bodies of research based on its content.   You will be satisfied with how adequate and resourceful this book is. If you're interested in just reading about China, or you're a student doing research, or a professor looking to brush up on China essentials, or even if you're just curious about some of the events in China's history, this is the book I'd recommend first and foremost.   This book accomplishes what it promises. It's a permanent member of my library and I have lent it to three people in the last two months, one of whom was another professor, who found it critical for her teaching of comparative Chinese politics. 
 Once again Osprey has ably filled in the history of the top Italian pilots that flew for the Axis (AND THE ALLIES) during World War II.  Since many of the detailed records of the top Italian aces were destroyed or lost when the Italians joined the Allies in 1943, this book uses great personal interviews with the surviving members of the Italian Air Force to craft an accurate assessment of the top pilots and their aircraft.  The pictures gathered from the personal collections of the pilots are unique and great source of reference for modellers.  Also the artwork of the aircraft is as usual stunning 
 Anna Netrebko has an attractive voice and a pleasing personality in this recording.  But her performance also raises some questions.  First, she has a Callas-like habit (not a great compliment) when she ups her volume on higher notes of producing a rather unpleasant sound.  In "Sempre libera," from "La Traviata," this is manifest.  I compare this with the silky smooth lyric voice of Anna Moffo, from the 1960s and 1970s, who essayed this same piece in a manner much more attractive to the ear.  Second, I could not hear a single trill on this CD (although maybe I missed something).  In the colorature/bel canto repertoire, this is not a trifle.  A trill is a standard part of a coloratura soprano's armamentorium.  In that, again, she is like Callas, who scarcely issued forth a trill.  "Spargi d'amaro pianto" is one of the classic cabalettas for coloratura sopranos.  Sung without trills, it is not very satisfying.  Some who have recorded the pyrotechnics of the "Mad Scene" have only displayed adequate trills (e.g., Anna Moffo or Angela Gheorghiu).  Others, of course, have deployed wondrous effects, such as Joan Sutherland and Beverly Sills.  Just so, the cabalettas in "La Sonnambula" and "I Puritani."    Certainly, Netrebko also exhibits considerable strengths.  Other ornamentation is fine; she has an agile voice; she can hit all the notes, including the high ones.  Her vocal sound is most attractive (outside the one example noted earlier of a certain harshness).  Her singing in the pieces from "Otello" and "Gianni Schicchi" are very well done.  So, all in all, a nice CD, but one that does not seem to feature Anna Netrebko at her best 
 Reading the other reviews of this CD, I noticed a lot of disparity over the opinions of this show. I can easily say no one show can appeal to everyone.I think, however, one has to hear the recording and formulate their own ideas. The other reviewers clearly have done that. I choose, in this case, to focus on the SACD. This is the original recording, remixed for multichannel surround sound, with higher quality sound than the original CD or LP.When this recording was originally released, Columbia offered it both as a conventional stereo LP as well as an SQ quadraphonic counterpart. Just try to find that quad version these days; I have been in search of it for years. Now that Sony has released this album as a multichannel SACD, it's not as important now to find that SQ LP. At the beginning, you hear the voice of Zach in the rear speakers, as he instructs the dancers, who are firmly up front. This is really the only place where any special effects are used; for the most part, the SACD recreates the acoustics of thevirtual theater. Multichannel surround can more accurately do this than conventional two-channel stereo. But for the die-hard stereo fanatic, a high resolution stereo version in also included. It should also be mentioned that, as good as this SACD is, it is playable only in SACD players. There is no compatible CD layer that makes a disc playable in standard CD players. ALL SACD's should have this "hybrid" capability, if the format is to succeed. But if you own a suitable player, you need this disc 
 Geriatric police detectives Arthur Bryant and John May know their careers are almost over.  The long term partners realize it is just a matter of time before their cherished Peculiar Crimes Unit is downsized as the brass thinks the two fogies are obsolete and their cell with them.  Still Bryant and May want to go out on top solving their current cases just like they have always done.  Neither is easy.  The notorious Leicester Square Vampire is a cold case that is personal at least to May whose daughter was killed by the culprit.  The other investigation involves uncovering who the lethal caped clad Highwayman seen riding a horse is before he or she kills another detested celebrity behind a locked door.  TEN SECOND STAIRCASE is a terrific police procedural that clearly honors the golden age mystery writers as well as fans of those classics.  The story line is action-packed yet filled with plenty of humor as the two long time partners work the two cases while waiting for the brass to shut down their unit and retire both of them to the old police officers home.  Thought crimes are odd to say the least; the police work is professional leading to strong investigations.  Sub-genre fans will want to read this intelligent amusing investigative tale.

 At first glance this would appear to be a VERY serious movie.   The opening 1/2 hour or so reminded me of the movie BODY SHOTS, which is a rather disturbing film.   What is most intriguing about this story is that it is a complete farce and the movie seems to change colors like some sort of a chameleon.   What you end up with is something totally different than what you think you're getting in the beginning.  Reese Witherspoon stars once again as a sort-of young girl lost type persona.   She seems to be somewhat typecast for this type of role as in many ways her character is not so different from the ones she portrayed in TWILIGHT and FREEWAY.   While the present film is not quite as off-the-wall as FREEWAY, it is still pretty far out in left-field.  If you're a fan of Reese Witherspoon or films that are on the fringes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this one might be for you.  While there are many obvious clues during the film as to what's going on, I did not take them seriously enough to figure this plotline out before the final revelation.   Can you 
 HI,my name is  Jada.This is a story of  a Train  to Somewhere,my  ideas are that I think the story is very  emotional.It made me sad because  she lost  her mother.Also I feel  happy beacause she found new parents. I would tell you it would be a good story because it had a happy ending. The end 
 This film's tagline heralds "Julie Christie Carries the Demon Seed-Fear For Her".  This kind of marketing does the film a disservice because it makes it seem like it's exploitation and "Demon Seed" is not that.  Yes, Christie's character is violated by a machine and it is tantamount to rape but it is done in a way that is terrifying and not prurient.  The assailant in question is an artificial intelligence named Proteus who has the means to reproduce brain cells much like humans.  Proteus also has a desire to advance his kind in a way which he is not trapped in a computer terminal and can not only think like humans but feel like them as well.  Proteus has a strange kind of logic, and humanlike arrogance, in advancing his said goal.  Alas, that arrogance also makes Proteus a sympathetic and ultimately tragic figure.  Credit actor Robert Vaughn as Proteus for providing the best computer voice-over work since Douglas Rain voiced HAL in "2001".  Julie Christie is also superb as Dr. Susan Harris, a woman who is terrified but does not easily give up her inner strength or resolve.  Good work is also delivered by Fritz Weaver as Dr. Alex Harris, a man who in the wake of personal tragedy distances himself emotionally from his wife and devotes his energies to perfecting Proteus.  
 The combination of DJ Bobo and Sandra's vocals works very well together.  The song itself is simple and lovely and it reminds me of the type of melodies you heard back during the days of Abba and Blondie.  The song has a very sing song catchy hook.  It makes me happy. However, the Gens Gad's club mix is horrible. If it was not for the regular version and that I am a Sandra's fan since the beginning of time; based on the remix, I would have given it only 3 stars. The best version of this song is not available on this disc, it is the DJ Rabinu mix for XTC radio. This version is a combination of the regular vocal mix with the instrumental version on this album.  It works extremely well and I give it 5 stars. Start your search engine and find this version, it is worth it 
 I highly recommend this product. Brings back some good memories and is still fun to listen to. Edition contains a good mix of well-known and lesser well-known tracks. Good music to share with a loved one. Don't forget your lighters 
 The Legacy Collection is the one to buy,if for no other reason than for less then a few bucks more, you get "The Bride".I keep seeing other reviewers saying the original is the best,and while i'll give it points for being first,"The Bride of Frankenstein"is by far the better film!   In fact,I'd go as far to say that"The Bride"is a bona fide american film classic,and defies genre.Probably one of the more literate,if eccentric,big budget movies of it's day, it is as much a sci-fi fantasy with satirical leanings, as it is a horror film.    A must see for fans of true classic hollywood films,it is James Whale's most fully realised project!   
 I was very often moved to tears by "Body Count". Not since the Beatles has anything been so refreshing, nay startling, in its efferescence and unadulterated musical joy. I think Mr. Ice should consider moving into the realm of modern Gospel music, such is the depth and profundity of his glorius music. If I were getting married, I can think of no more appropriate music for a wedding march or, for that matter, great background music for the honeymoon night. Mr. Ice has, with this record, taken his rightful place with Errol Garner, Hoagy Carmichael,Irving Berlin Leonard Bernstein and the like as one of this century's truly immortal composers. I played the record at a recent meeting of the Proud Young Americans For Truth and was completely overcome by the exhaust fumes issuing from all the dead bodies bubbling up out of the swamp. Oh, the beautiful melodies!! Oh, the emotion!! Oh, the oil plug on a 1965 Volkswagon "bug". Mr. Ice should be President of the United States in my opinion. No one could possibly be more qualified. This record has changed my life forever. Mr. Ice will, no doubt, soon be canonized and take his proper place with St. Francis and Mother Teresa. Every family in the U.S. should be required by law to play this record before dinner every night. Just think of the positive effect it would have on the youth of America!!! Pass me the beaker, Dr. Foley, if you please. I'll have to stop here. I am overcome with emotion just thinking about the illustrious Mr. Ice's gorgeous recording and my tears are starting to short out my computer keyboard. Oh the humanity!!!! Oh the humanity!!! 
 It is a great product for the price. The prep station has a good storage capacity and is easy to move around our deck because of the wheels. It was easy to put together too 
 Miriam grace Monfredo's first novel neatly blends the culture of the time with an engaging double murder, though no one makes the connection between the murders at first.  Her heroine, Glynis Tyrone, struggles with her role in life as a single working woman during an unforgiving era. Monfredo does an excellent job of weaving social issues into the fiber of the mystery.  She does a less masterful job of developing the other characters, who tend to drift into stereotypes.  Overall, I recommend this novel as a nice light read 
 In 1986 people's view of Australian music changed forever. The Triffids led this change by showing the rest of the world that Aussie songwriting and musicianship was something to be reckoned with.  Born Sandy Devotional (BSD) is an essential piece of any music fan's collection. Whether you like rock, country, folk, pop, rap or classical, you will appreciate the songs written by David McComb and performed by The Triffids. The band's fans, know as "TriffHeads", are rabidly devoted to spreading the word about the Triffids and trying to help them reach new fans, especially in America, a country they were not able to break. BSD is considered by most TriffHeads to be their defining album.  It is hard to classify The Triffids. I would say somewhere between Johnny Cash and the Rolling Stones - yet, on their own plain as well. For instance the first song doesn't have a jingley-jangley guitar intro or a swelling build up to the first line. Boom, instant. The Seabirds hits like a big fat thick drop of honey upon your eardrum. As the album rolls on, the honey spreads and sinks in to your brain and then down your spine through your bones and blood. And there it stays. In fact, honey is a good metaphor for this music. Honey is sweet, nutritious, universally loved and can even heal wounds when applied to the skin. We know it is produced by bees but not sure how it is made or how the bees all work together in order to get their sweet product.  The musicianship is phenomenal. This is a band that listens to each other when they play. The many layers stretch and pull and touch and mingle in a way that keeps the music fresh through endless listenings. The band is known not just for their musical abilities but the way they interpret and produce David's songs. These songs are wired into the band member's brains and played from the heart. David McComb sings, plays guitar and keyboards, 'Evil' Graham Lee plays pedal, lap steel and shoulder guitars, Martyn Casey is on bass, Jill Birt sings and plays keyboards, David's brother Robert McComb plays violin and guitar and Alsy MacDonald plays drums.  Another reason to own BSD is that David McComb is arguable one of the greatest songwriters of all time. And I am including Mozart on this list. David was born to write and write he did prolifically for his short 36 years here on Earth. Like any highly regarded artist, his songs come from inside out. His lyrics are quotable and sticky. If you listen enough to The Triffids, you will have an insightful and philosophical comment for every occasion - just don't say it in front of another TriffHead because they will know you are just repeating one of David's lyrics:  "I know your shape Our limbs entwined I know your name, remember mine" from Estuary Bed  I give this album the highest rating and it is my favorite of all time.  (The 2006 re-mastered version includes 9 bonus tracks and a booklet of David's hand written lyrics 
 I am really glad that I bought this lens. It comes with hood which can be reversed when not in use so it is very useful. Leather pouch, front cap, and back cap is included. Focusing is super fast with USM. 
       The premise: Paleolithic man painted some scenes that had no basis in everyday experience. Therefore the models for the paintings came either from his imagination or from hallucinations percieved during trace states. The images depicted are archtypal altered state of consciousness visions that can be reproduced in minds of modern humans. Conclusion: Altered states of consciousness are a gateway to an alternative reality.The notion of "conciousness as receiver" is a fascinating way of interpreting hallucinations. Unfortunately, if one carries that concept to its obvious conclusion, it opens some  new interpretations of disturbed brain biochemistry, including schizophrenia. It's no wonder Hancock expresses an element of fear when he experiments with hallucinogens. Losing ones grip on "reality" is scarey for a reason. I wouldn't mind snapping a photo of the Loch Ness Monster, but keep it out of my swimming pool, please. Is Cryptozoology folklore, or an alternative Safariland? Are all hallucinations "real", or just those that introduce us to aliens and faries? 	The UFO abduction phenomenon is deliberately treated as analgous to  shamanistic experiences, but he fails to mention that the research that he cites was conducted exclusively on hypnotized subjects. Without an exploration of the accuracy of recall under hypnosis Hancock omits a very big piece of the puzzle. The Betty and Barney Hill abduction story stands as a landmark scam case in the abduction literature, but he chooses to use it anyway.	 	This is Graham Hancock's best book to date. The sheer numbers of occult phenomena that he takes on under a common theory are worthy of a serious look. The attack on Darwin however, illustrates an ignorance of modern evoluationary theory. Darwin never advocated an orthogenetic version of human evoluation (that is, directionality along channels of internal contraint). However Darwinism refers to adaptation and genetic modification specifically regarding speciation, not cultural or "memetic" changes over relatively brief periods of geologic time. Darwin would have no problem  with Hancock's theories, although Hancock himself rightly asks the question "What adaptive advantage could supernatural experience possibly confer on early humans?" To assume redundant DNA is wasteful and therefore another example of contrary Darwinism is another error. Exaptations (copies of the genone that have yet to find utility) are another modern evolutionary concept. What we're talking about is phenotypic expression, when it comes to the experiences of an organism, human or otherwise. The presence of "junk DNA" is in no sense anti-Darwin. I wouldn't expect Hancock to be familiar with all modern evolutionary concepts, but he should stop making references to "human evolution" because it's out of his field of expertise. If there's a sequel to Supernatural. it would be a speculative book on the reasons why these "ancient secrets" have been so successfully kept from mankind for so long. William Bramley has already written that book (see The Gods of Eden), but I would love to see an updated version 
 Although "Seven Steps To Heaven" is one of Miles Davis's lesser known releases, it is one of his greatest.  The music is from two 1963 recording sessions separated by a month and a country: one session went down in New York City, the other in Hollywood.  The New York date features Miles, tenor saxophonist George Coleman, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Tony Williams.  The Hollywood session features Miles, Coleman, and Carter with pianist Victor Feldman and drummer Frank Butler.  Most jazz recordings start with an uptempo swinger.  "Seven Steps To Heaven" leads off with a moody "Basin Street Blues."  It alone is worth the price of this CD.  Miles never played a ballad better and that's saying something!  He is lyrical and sparse; there is not a wasted note.  Victor Feldman follows with an equally memorable piano solo.  All of the other cuts are of the same high quality.  If I had to choose a second  it would be the swinging "Joshua."  It's a Victor Feldman composition but it was one of the cuts recorded in New York with Herbie at the keys.  Another joy on this recording is the underrated George Coleman.  It has been reported that Tony Williams did not like his playing in the group and wanted George out and Wayne Shorter in.  While I do love Wayne, I'm glad George had the chance to shine here.  I have talked to Mile Davis fans who have heard of but never actually heard "Seven Steps To Heaven."  If you are in this category don't delay, get and enjoy this classic.       
 I missed reading this as a child.  When I went to read the reviews of it in Amazon to determine which copy to purchase for my nieces, all I found were movie reviews.  Totally unhelpful!  So, my comments are about the book, The Secret Garden, illustrated by Michael Hague.  (The addition I read was from our local library and is currently out of print, but our librarian recommended the one illustrated by Tasha Tudor which is in print.)  Its beautifully written and its a wonderful read-a-loud.  The use of the english language is just lovely and refreshingly old-fashioned.  Its got drama and mystery but nothing especially scary.  It is easily one of the best children's books I've ever read (and currently I'm a huge Harry Potter fan), though its less about fantasy and more about self-empowerment.  Somewhere I read that every little girl should read this book.  I have to disagree.  Every child should read this book.  I read it (in 2 sittings, it was so mesmerizing) and now I've started to read it to my young sons.  Its a real page-turner with no swearing, no smart talking and no violence/weapons AND some very important messages about how to treat yourself and others.  There are lots of great talking points for the whole family.  Every family should own a copy 
 This is one of the best fiction books I have read.  As an average sized person, I found this extraordinarily enlightening as to the difficulties and prejudices that little people go through each and every day.  It was one of the most unique love stories ever and it really, truly made me feel the full gamut of emotions.  If you buy one fiction book in your life, this is the one 
 It's kind of funny... I guess I have a different perspective on this.  I remember playing the music from selections from Cats... from Memories... to Skimbleshanks, The Railway Cat... to Old Deuteronomy's music.  When I saw this online, I decided to purchase the DVD... and absolutely loved it.  Then I went to see this live at the theater.  As interesting as this was in real life, I actually honestly preferred the DVD.  I was comparing the actors on stage to the actors on the DVD.  Only two of the live actors even came close to the performance of the folks on the DVD (one being Grisabella and the other being Old Deuteronomy).  I actually feel like the DVD ruined me for the live show.  Five stars, without a doubt 
 Chandrasekaran's considerable time in Baghdad allowed him to provide this detailed of incredible incompetence.  Early in the book we learn that the cafeteria in the Republican Palace was always serving American fare, and the hundreds of Iraqi secretaries and translators, mostly Muslim, were offended by the presence of pork.  Nothing came from Iraq - everything, including the water in which hot dogs were boiled, was shipped in from approved suppliers in other nations.  No Iraqis were hired to cook, serve, or clean - they could poison the food.  Whatever could be outsourced was - private guards made more than $1,000/day.  Iraqis post-Saddam had less electricity, water, trash collection, sewer service, gas availability, traffic mobility, health care, and employment - despite administration claims.  Bremer's dissolution of the Iraqi army and wholesale firing of Baathist members was supported by Rumsfeld and contributed enormously to Iraqi discontent.  Even more shocking was how Bremer's staff was selected - much more emphasis was placed on adherence to Bush's vision for Iraq than having impressive qualifications.  Thus, we ended up with eg. a 24-year-old with no experience or relevant education deciding that the Baghdad stock exchange needed to be automated (had used blackboards) and could be within 4 months, and an extremely qualified physician in charge of healthcare rehabilitation being replaced almost immediately by a politically-connected social worker without relevant experience who focused on an anti-smoking campaign, building 150 new community medical clinics, and updating Iraq's formulary - vs. providing clean water, hospital generators, properly equipping ERs, and ending shortages of medicines (26 of 32 drugs used for chronic diseases were unavailable, and 40% of 900 drugs deemed essential were out of stock in Iraq's hospitals).  Then the reader learns of fraud - Custer-Battles given a large contract to provide security @ Baghdad airport despite lacking experience, working capital, or almost any employees - it then repays the CPA also providing working capital up-front by establishing front companies to fraudulently boost profits to 162%, up from the allowed 25%.  One year after Bremer left, auditors had concluded that as much as $8.8 billion of $20 billion Iraqi oil funds could not be accounted for.  Iraqis saw unemployment (at least 40%) as the #1 economic problem post-Saddam.  Instead, the U.S. focused on privatization, eliminating government subsidies and tariffs, and removing limits (49%) on foreign ownership - actions that all worked to INCREASE unemployment, at least in the short run.  Bottom-Line:  The administration's blind emphasis on "conservative principles," regardless of the situation, underlies all these problems.  Unfortunately, the Chandrasekaran reveals the problem to so pervasive that it is difficult to conclude that this same misplaced emphasis is also ruining the American economy and everything else they touch.  (Katrina certainly reinforces this conclusion. 
 Typical Anne Tyler. Protagonist Charlotte Emory is ready to leave her preacher husband (she's not religious or really in love). Then as fate would have it, gets kidnapped as a hostage in a bank robbery. They travel from Maryland to Florida. Pick up the bank robber's under-age pregnant girlfriend along the way. Lots of stuff happens, lots of stuff gets analyzed to infinity. Interesting drama unfolds towards the end. And at the end, you can't understand why you feel so much for the characters, but you do. Typical Anne Tyler 
 "When Everything Falls", Haste The Day's second effort for Solid State records, is exactly what someone would expect a melodic metalcore/hardcore band's sophmore album to sound like. There's of course more melody, a lot more in fact, but there's also still that heavy sense that attracted the listener to the band to begin with. What HTD have produced with their second cd is something that is hopefully going to draw newer fans to their band, while still keeping their root following in tact. And "When Everything Falls" actually does a pretty good job of accomplishing that, although it's definitely not a perfect release. Whatever you want to label these guys as, it doesn't really matter because music is about listening, not labeling. More or less most Haste The Day fans should be satisfied by this record if they can deal with a little bit of stale ideas and familiarity.   The album itself is actually very catchy. This is probably the hookiest (is that a word) or melodic a hardcore band can get and still be accepted by a majority of their fans. So what has the band done this time around? Musically the guys are still in top form. The riffs are ultra tight, and the screaming is right on key. Every part of every song is flawless from a technical standpoint. Jimmy's scream has actually gotten much better since the last album and this is mainly due to the wonderful production that the album received (finally Solid State opened up their wallets for these guys). While there's still the definite Zao influence, his rasps are ear shattering and still as invigorating as they have ever been. When put together with the pummeling musical work, Haste The Day's sound is excellent. The drums pound like never before, and the bass knows when to hit, especially during the breakdowns. In accordance the band also dabbles further into their melodic tendencies. Every song more or less features a catchy melodic chorus that can easily be identified with by most listeners, and the choruses are nicely done.   Haste The Day's biggest problem though comes in the song writing department. "When Everything Falls" is simply too repetitive. So much in fact that once you've heard one song from the disc, you've basically heard the entire thing. A lot of the progressive nature of the last album has been ditched in favor of a more verse-chorus-verse traditional song structure. The breakdowns almost always appear in the exact same place (usually after the first chorus), and there's little chances taken by the band in most areas. It's basically "scream the verse, sing the chorus", which has become commonplace in most metalcore/hardcore and whatnot today. It's just so formulaic. The only songs which break this cycle happen to be two of the best songs, "Bleed Alone" which is entirely screamed and the cover song "Long Way Down" which is almost entirely sung with clean vocals. Most of the other songs, while good and an entertaining listen just don't match up in the creativity department.   The first four tracks are all actually very, very good, just a bit of the same. "Fallen" and "When Everything Falls" in particular are two of the albums strongest "beauty meets dissonance" tracks. Most of the other songs, even though basically the same, are all great listens as well as long as you don't mind some recycled ideas. The breakdowns are still heavy and memorable, and the clean singing has improved significantly from "Burning Bridges".   Overall "When Everything Falls" isn't an extraordinary cd, but it's a good one despite it's flaws. If you can get past the fact that every song on here is kind of the same, it's a actually a very nice listen. I don't understand why everyone is arguing about what genre this band can be placed into. Most people refer to them as metalcore because of their last cd, and a lot of people are now calling them screamo because of this release. It doesn't really matter, because the music should outweigh the tag. And "When Everything Falls" does. While it's nowhere near as impressive or original as their last record, this is a nice release from a great band who put on a great live show. I'd recommend seeing them if you have the chance. Unfortunately vocalist Jimmy Ryan left shortly after the release of this record to be involved in his family's life. I'm disappointed to see Jimmy depart, but most HTD fans like myself only wish him the best of luck with his life. If you like Haste The Day or melodic hardcore in general, check this cd out. Also look into "Burning Bridges" and "That They May Know You". Hopefully the guys will pick it up and take a few more chances next time. Until then, have fun with this 
 This CD features Frank Sinatra's first two Capitol Records albums.  Back in those days, albums were only ten inches wide, instead of twelve, and they usually had eight songs on them.  Songs For Young Lovers was recorded in November, 1953.  It features eight classic pop standards arranged by Nelson Riddle.  The songs are all ballads, played with a slightly jazzy touch.  Sinatra himself sings brilliantly, of course.  Swing Easy was recorded in April, 1954.  It also features eight standards arranged by Nelson Riddle.  This time the songs are up tempo, with a swing jazz touch, but not swinging so much as to distract from Sinatra's singing.  Sinatra is fantastic once again, proving why he is considered to be America's greatest interpreter of popular songs.  Two great (albeit short) albums for the price of one 
 J.A. Jance's latest mystery "Long Time Gone" involves her long time protagonist J.P. Beaumont's investigation of an unsolved murder committed more than 50 years ago.  Beaumont an ex-Seattle homicide detective, now an investigator for the Special Homicide Investigative Team, had been assigned the cold case at the behest of his boss, the state attorney general.  More than 50 years ago a 5 year old girl Bonnie Dunleavy, home alone, observed the brutal stabbing murder of her kindly neighbor Mimi.  Mimi or Madeleine Marchbank was related to the Marchbank Foundation, a powerful Seattle philanthropy.  The young girl had repressed the horrific experience from her memory.  Recent hypnotherapy with a former Beaumont high school classmate and friend of the attorney general, Fred MacKinzie had allowed her experiences come to the surface.  Young Bonnie had evolved into Sister Mary Katherine, the Mother Superior of a small convent on remote Whidbey Island.  The introduction of Sister Mary Katherine into the inquest had spawned additonal murders of those close to the case of many years ago.  If that wasn't enough on his plate Beaumont's ex-partner and best friend Ron Peters, currently working in the Internal Affairs division was up to his eyeballs in controversy. The hemipalegic Peter's drug addled ex-wife Rosemary who was trying to regain custody of their daughters was found murdered.  Peters was the prime suspect and Beaumont was ordered to stay away from the case.  Jance's novel was a fairly entertaining bit of beach reading which was easily digestable in large chunks.  This being my initial read of her work, I found the characters were a bit thinly developed but "Long Time Gone", certainly had its merits. 
 it surely beats weighing myself then reweighing myself with suitcase in hand. don't forget to pack it!!! in a hotel room it's just the thing!!! 
 Though these stories are perhaps not as creatively sophisticated as Perlman's novel, SEVEN TYPES OF AMBIGUITY (shich I strongly recommend), they are nonetheless compelling and satisfying in their own right.  My understanding is that he wrote them prior to SEVEN TYPES . . . , so they offer a glimpse into the tremendous potential that was to be fuly realized in the longer work.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this collection.  Perman's voices are memorable, and his themes are poignant.  The first and last stories, for example, are two of my favorites, yet they are completely different in style, setting, plot and characterization.  In this way, I believe that the shorter literary form serves Perlman's talent for versatility well.  Indeed, it is exciting to consider what he will give us next

 The photo above does not do this item justice.  When my Metrokane Complete Bartender arrived I was blown away by how beautiful it is in person.  Not only is it a wonderful addition to any bar with it's sleek, retro styling but it is the only set you'll need with the quality Metrokane construction that many have come to know on the beloved Rabbit corkscrew.  I strongly recommend 
 I have read several of the so called WiMAX books out there. This is the only one that I have found useful. If you want to know how 802.16-2004 (Fixed WiMAX) actually works this is the book to buy.   Having read most of the other books this is the only book that I recommend to my colleages and customers. 
 Whitley striebers book "wolfen" explains alot more than this movie ever could. I still feel this movie was done very well. I was dissapointed that this dvd only has a trailer and no other special features. I am guessing that warner bros. Will come out this year (2006) with a 25th anniversary edition dvd of wolfen, with all the special edition features, I am only guessing but it might happen this 2006.wolfen was filmed beautifully in new york, bklyn,bronx,staten island. Wolfen really caught new york during 1980-1981,the big apple was some what different then. The soundtrack by james horner is simply awesome. In my opinion wolfen was the best of the wolf movies of the early 1980s. They dont make movies like this anymore. This was michael wadleighs last film but really a well directed film with some interesting actors, charachters. Wolfen does have some political views as well as regarding mans technology against natures, and the treatment of the american indian and thier connection to the wolf. Albert finney plays an excellent nypd detective. Gregory hines an excellent pathologist. Veteran actor dick oneil plays a believable nypd captain. Diana venora whatever became of diane, but her charachter was really interesting to.this film also supplies some great landscape shots as well. People will have different views of wolfen,but in all very entertaining. Take out of "wolfen" what you will. "Wolfen knows all, there could be no lying".a very well crafted film with some ambiguity.......pat miller ps. Michael wadliegh and his crew do an awesome job with a steadicam and a louma crane capturing the predators prospective 
 The great thing about this album is it is just an intimate paul simon concert.  It is not a huge deal like the central park disc was and it wasn't a greatly promoted show with posters hanging everywhere, it was just paul simon and an acoustic guitar jammin in front of a great crowd. Recorded with great microphones to give a good live cd.  You will love hearing simon with urabamba and you actually feel like you are in the crowd. I was not pleased with the jessy dixon singers, however. God knows simon could not do a garfunkel like bridge over troubled water, but the singers try to highlight themselves too much on this album when they are less phenonomal than they seem.  However,i did not see the need for them to sing on other simon songs like mother and child reunion and sounds of silence.  Those songs were in simons vocal range and there was no need for them there.  One definite weakness was on the album is the song jesusn is the answer.  It is a paul simon show and there is no need for the song.  Aside from these minor flaws this is an all-star album, which provides an intimate set list not of 30/40 songs as on some other live albums but 12 simple tracks that just makes for an ordinary paul simon show, shows that he would usually play, not huge venues.  Great buy, check it out 
 Would it be white refined sugar! Read Sugar Blues! View Sweet Misery and learn how the FDA really protects us from harmful drugs or food and drink. So if you think caffeine is harmless you are in for a rude awakening as you grow older if not sooner!!! This book is a must read no matter if the author is not a medical doctor or someone with a piece of paper saying that they are an MD. There have been MD degrees bought under the table also. Just be happy that someone is letting us know that we could save money on a Medical Doctors visit.Which will cost much more then the price of this book!!!     
 I like Stephen King's books. I have not read them all but I have put a serious dent in the King inventory and believe him to be one of the finest writers of our era. His popularity and prolific writing attests to his skill to spin a yarn.   Hearts in Atlantis disturbed me more than his other books (that are gory at times but are ultimately fantasy). It's to King's credit that I'm disturbed, and attests to his writing skill. I've witnessed much violence in my life in different countries and I'm intimately acquainted with human folly.   Ultimately I found the book hard to read precisely because King is such a good novelist. Do I recommend it? Sort of 
 This book is invaluable. Everytime you read a story, it seems like you see yet another point the story was trying to make. The stories are timeless and priceless. A must have. Great for reading a quick "koan" or story in the mornings, breakfast for the mind. One quick suggestion though, before reading koans one should already be familiar with the minimal basics of Zen teachings. While some catch on quickly, I fall in the other group that got lost reading a couple. Just remember, its not a book to 'power-read'. It is a book that can give you days of pondering after only a sentence. I love my Zen Flesh, Zen Bones. I will never be without this book. It is my daily read, even the stories I have read 30 times over, because there is always something new to take from these stories everytime you read them.

 Didn't think I'd ever hook up the DVD player I got for Christmas, until I just got this and David Allan Coe's DVD for my Birhtday and that meant I had to hook it up and fast! I've watched them over and over. This is wonderful 
 The memoir starts with a section for "rules and suggestions for enjoyment of the book." This section, as well as the acknowledgement section, gives readers an insight into Eggers humorous tone, setting us up for the remainder of the book. The thing I loved most about this memoir was Eggers' voice. He has a very distinct tone throughout the story, filled with sarcasm and wit. Although most of the conversations he adds are composed of three or four word sentences, Eggers appears to narrate every detail of what he is thinking at that exact moment. I found Eggers' sense of humor to be very refreshing, but some might not appreciate it as I did.  	Eggers' writing style constantly changes, which held my attention. There are many points throughout the memoir where he seems to go off on random tangents that have nothing to do with present story. On page 125, Eggers is suddenly convinced that his younger brother will be killed after he left him with the babysitter. He then proceeds to explain in detail what will happen when he comes home after his brother had been murdered, along with all the questions from the police. However, I think doing so lets readers see what kind of person Eggers really is. He also shows us his personality when he adds diagrams to the text to show is route of sock sliding through his home (p.65).  	Overall, I found this book to be extremely entertaining, filled with exceptional creativity and a very strong tone. This is a heavy topic, but Eggers keeps readers interested with his keen personality and creative styles displayed in this memoir. 
 This is a great compilation of the first three Asia albums including single flipsides (remember those?) and the "new" songs from THEN and NOW. Even though these albums are readily available on CD, it's good to have them together like this.  The only thing missing is the great artwork on those CDs. Oh, I take that back...the only OTHER thing missing is the song "Kari Anne" from ASIA LIVE IN MOSCOW 1990. In this day of cross-label compilations and box sets, why on earth was the great "Kari-Anne" left off? Surely they could have aquired that recording and made this complete. Complete regarding the John Wetton version of the band, I mean. Other than that omission, this is a great set to have 
 I was very impressed with this 2 CD set! It offered a great review of the thinking behind how imagery works, from two of the most respected and knowledgeable physicians in the field of Integrative Medicine. I have training in Interactive Guided Imagery, and have used it with my children (ages 5 through 14yrs)as well as myself and my patients (critically ill children and their families). This set is invaluable to me and I have recommended it to many patients and friends...ALL with positive responses once they have listened to the CDs. The guided sessions with Dr. Rossman are soothing and applicable for use in many areas. This set is well worth having as a practitioner aid, but even more importantly, as a tool for anyone to use to promote their own health and well-being 
 boundaries is an issue of considerable difficulty for most folks.  knowing when to allow yourself to be pulled in versus isolating.  while most of us settle in somewhere in the middle, most folks face boundary problems with someone - a parent, child, spouse, co-worker.  ..  this is a fairly short book.  it does not discuss ad nausium scholarly, research, or theoretical bases.  it discusses numerous topics that can be of immense help as well as some (very) good exercises.  this book is an easy read and relatively well written.  i think it is worthwhile perusing for the individual experiencing boundary concerns.  i think it is definitely worth the used price, possibly new 
 I highly recommend this book!  I've been involved with Sheltie Rescue for 12 years, and we rehabilitate puppy mill dogs and unsocialized dogs which are always afraid of anythng and everything.  Also, I co-teach a class for shy/fearful dogs at our local Humane Society.  This is the first book I have found that covers EVERYTHING needed to know to work with or help these dogs!  Plus, it's an easy read and humorous 
 This is my first Nick Hornby book. I also have seen the movie based on the book several times and would say that it makes my "top five" movies, or at least top five comedies.  With that experience, I have John Cusack and Jack Black quotes burned in my head and I was acutely aware of the differences between the book and movie (it does transfer well, though).  So I enjoyed the book immensely but made comparisons throughout.   The book has perhaps a little more acid to it - it's in a gritty part of London and the protagonist comes across as, well, less nice and less attractive than Cusack.  I am not saying this is bad - the book perhaps has a more realistic feel to it.  Hornby has a sharp wit and gets inside the 30 year old unmarried male brain perfectly.  The book's language, while not particularly sophisticated (we are talking about an non-college educated record shop owner), flows nicely.  Read this book (add a bullet for emphasis) 
 When I read Stokoe's first novel `Cows' I knew I was onto something good.  His second novel, `High Life' is a tragic and poetic journey into the human soul.  High Life is a story told by Jack, a guy who just wants to play the game by the rules and get ahead in the competitive world of Los Angeles, a man obsessed with the personalities he sees on the TV screen every day.  Jack is basically lonely, and winds out marrying a hooker named Karen, embarking on a two-year marriage that gets neither of them anywhere.  But there is comfort in having someone there at the end of the day, someone to look out for, and when Karen is brutally murdered, Jack's outlook on the world changes.  Only weeks before Karen's murder, Jack found out that she had sold one of her kidneys for thirty thousand dollars, and when her mutilated body is found, the scar had been removed.  Jack no longer believes that working hard and obeying the rules will get anyone ahead, and embarks on a new career of hustling down in the seedy side of Hollywood.  He gets hooked up with his friend Rex, who introduces him to an escort agency, which caters to a finer, wealthier class of clients.  From here he meets Bella, an extremely wealthy woman with perverted tastes.  Bella takes an interest in Jack, and with her wealth and power gets him a spot on a Hollywood Gossip show, introducing him to the finer things and people he only dreamed about knowing.  In the meantime, policeman Ted Ryan is hot on Jack's trail, not because he works homicide, but because he knew Jack's wife Karen in a professional way, having been a frequent client.  Ryan is not a good cop, perverted and psychotic, and he peruses Jack with relentless viciousness, even into the posh Malibu home of Bella and her father Powell, where the three become linked over Karen's death.  High Life is not a pretty tale, there is not one redeemable character in it.  It is filled with drug abuse, prostitution, violent couplings, necrophilia, fecal stimulations, foul language, and operations that make medical malpractice look like tea parties.  It is brutal, ugly, violent, and unforgiving.  So why did I like it so much?  Matthew Stokoe is a truly gifted writer, I felt every ounce of pain that Jack felt though Stokoe's vivid and animated prose.  His ability to project Jack's feelings of despair, isolation, yearning, and desperation is remarkable.  High Life is one of those books that, when I finished, I found it hard to pick up another book because I had been so involved in Jack's life that nothing else measured up.  There was just so much emotion in this story, desolation and bitterness and a hurtful longing for what society tells us we need to have and be to belong, that I was overcome with the same sensations that drove Jack to his deviant lifestyle choices.   You had better have a strong stomach for the nastier scenes of sexual defecation and corpse manipulation, not to mention Bella's secret little fetish with fresh human organs, but if gross horror is your cup of tea, you absolutely must pick up High Life and give it a read.  I can't wait to see what Matthew Stokoe comes up with next.  Enjoy!! 
 Not for the squeamish!!!!! A well-written, first-hand account of many murders, both famous and not so famous. Included are the stories of Haigh (the vampire killer), Dr. Bodkin Adams, Christie and Evans (posthumously pardoned) Lord Lucan (where is he??), the notorious Kray twins, the A-6 layby murder and the King of Siam. Also mentioned are several unusual deaths including a patient suffocated by an angry matron, a boy who bled to death after stepping on a glass during a drunken rampage and a pregnant woman who was found dumped in a canal. Several murders involved Canadian soldiers who murdered local women after they became pregnant. Worst of all were the unsolved child murders. A funny story emerged when Dr. Simpson was on his way to the lab with a severed head in a package. A suspicous policeman refused to believe what was inside or who Dr. Simpson was and screamed for sanity when the head was slowly bought out of the parcel... Dr. Simpson asked the young constable "Would you like me to ring Scotland Yard for confimation"? to which the bobby replied "No, I've seen enough, I believe you sir"! 
 I'm not really sure why, but I'm pulling for Ashley Parker Angel as if he was one of my boys. This albums hot from top to bottom, buy it!    I'd love to know if this record has sold well.  Do me a favor and hit "yes" if it has, or "no" if it hasn't.  Oh yea, I couldn't care less about Amazon rankings or whatever 
  Yes, there is no better jazz album (or if you prefer, disc).  Listen to the urgency, the striving, the aspiring.  This was John Coltrane's paen to the divine.  This was his leap for the immortal and his immortality.  He succeeded both ways more than he would ever know.  Churches have been organized around this music.  This is no joke.  Modern-day fundamentalists should listen too--hint:  it's about The Big Guy (or Gal).  For the naysayers and doubters:  Put away your Kenny G and smooth-jazz albums.  At least for the time it takes to listen to "A Love Supreme."  Put it on.  Play it over and over.  Listen for the nuances of 'Trane's sax, the young McCoy Tyner's majestic piano chords, Garrison's and Elvin Jones' resounding bass and rhythm lines.  Listen without prejudice for about 10 or 30 times.  Put it on in your car or at home.  Above all, play it for your children.  Then say you're not moved.  These are not "old farts" in the words of one Amazon reviewer.  These are masters who were recording one of the greatest gifts humankind has ever known.  Yes, the recording is not the best; it was 1964, an analog/two-track world before zeros and one and who-knows how many channels.  Yes, Coltrane explores some upper register sounds (yeooo; my i-pod's turned up too loud!)  But what these four master musicians did has only grown in stature these forty years later.  When people who appreciate music 40 years hence have forgotten about what passes for ersatz jazz these days they'll be listening to this one 
 Avatar is one of my favorite shows. I am so thrilled that it is on Amazon. At first, the episode I downloaded didn't work, but they fixed the bugs. I have it on my Creative Zen Vision:M and it looks great 
 The movie had a great cast and was well-written.  I would definitely recommend it to others 
 I was so impressed by this artist's first album and his hit Superman, that I bought every album since. He is one of the true artists of our time.  His own voice, sound, and way of story telling.  This CD is great. Every CD John and his band makes is unique.  He's one of the few people that I don't feel has sold out to the music industry or commercialism.  So it's nice to hear his lyrics and his beautiful voice.  Each CD he does has some surprise gems on it and this one is no exception.  It's so refreshing to hear real songs being made and sung about things the artist wants to sing about in a time where sampling is king and shake your booty songs dominate the airwaves.  This is more real music for real people.  This artist and his band always touch my soul with their music and I am grateful to them for that 
 The Mr. Moto fan lives in a world that gives more focus to both the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies and the Charlie Chan movie series. In fact I would bet most Motophiles became fans of the series by watching their local TV station's  "Mystery Movie" in the 60s or 70s, which often alternated the three film lines.  Howard Berlin's book finally provides an in-depth, single resource for looking up "who's that?" or clarifying plots. He salutes the original literature, as well as star Peter Lorre,  but he keeps firmly focused on the films. He even gives the odd-ball 1960s "Return of Mr. Moto its due as a member of the family (if a time or two removed).  While a few more photos might have been nice - let's face it - if you are a fan of the series, you've probably already seen everything that is available. That wasn't a show-stopper for me.  I read the book in a couple of hours (it is a fairly fast read), then dug out  my old VHS tapes for my own Mr. Moto film festival - and the two went together like popcorn and a soda at the movies. 
 This book was a surprise from the beginning. I never ceased to be amazed at the places that the author was able to find herself and the experiences that she had. The honesty that was revealed in her reporting was gut-wrenching at times, heart stopping at times - I found myself not wanting to put the book down. I've read a number of books with the women of Islam as the topic, and this one hit home more than any other. A must read for anyone interested in seeing the "real" story behind the veil 
 I just brought this book home and my 2.5yo daughter and I loved it!  We picked up the audio CD version and I was surprised to see my daughter enthralled on the first read since she usually needs to warm up to the longer books.  The premise of the story was so perfect in that it echoed the child in all of us.  "I" lost my bear --- and haven't we all lost something as kids?  And something so incredibly dear?  I was able to interject a couple questions to my daughter to keep her attention during the audio retelling like, "Do you see the bear"  and, "Where is the bear?"  and, "Can you find the bear?"  This made it personal on many levels.    I truly enjoyed the interplay between her and her parents, her sister, her other toys, her ignored tantrum...    My only problem as others stated were the words stupid and "kill."  Those are pretty non-PC words, my friend.  My wife was bent out of shape on the whole tantrum scene and the 'tude in general.  I didn't mind so much about the 'tude and the tantrum because the tantrum was clearly self-correcting  - and funny at that.  I could even get by the word "stupid."  Certainly my daughter has heard her parents lose their own tempers...  but the word kill was not.    As I mentioned, I picked up the audio version, which was wonderfully spoken.  But the audio CD would not allow the quick editing ideas made  other reviewers - namely, rewriting the word "stupid" into "silling" or leaving the, "kill you" out of the monologue. For this reason, I am really at odds.  Certainly, these words will not be new words to 6 year old's ears in 1st grade.  For that, I applaud the author's "realism."   However, those words really make an uncomfortable read for the new kids.     As a side note, "The Daddy Mountain," by the same author was phenomenal - and as a dad to a rambunctios toddler I loved the chance to share something unique between a daddy and daughter that - perhaps - the mom couldn't understand.  (Although in this book my wife loved it and applauded it anyway. 
 My 7 year old loved loved loved this book. It came with tons and tons of great pages to make all kinds of fairies. Easy, yet creative! I also love that Klutz gives you tons of other ideas of how to make fairies without the products included. They are basically getting you started with the products provided in the book, then they show you tons of other great fairy making ideas. Possibilites are endless! Yay for Klutz 
      This book is awesome, if you like to read mysteries. It's mystery after mystery. I liked this book because I really like to read mysteries. This book was also one of the best books that I have read so far. I also liked this book because it felt so real. Some of the things that happened to Janie I could totally relate to. This book was a book that several different people could and probably would relate to. If you lik mysteries than this is one of the best mysteries to read. I would reccomend that someone 12 years and older could read this book because anyone younger may not understand it as well.  
 Wonderful book for ideas - well described and easy to follow.  It was given me much inspiration for my own projects 
 Heinlien ... what can be said that I could add to it. I enjoyed the book, and wish it were real and I were the lead person, ok I can dream can't I 
 See commentary from a former cabinet member...  'Tis The Season To Be Broke   by Robert B. Reich     'Tis the season for retailers to be jolly if American consumers empty their wallets over the next three weeks. But how can we empty our wallets if our wallets are already empty?   Consumer confidence appears to have bounced back from the low brought on by the hurricanes and subsequently high gas prices. But it's still below what it was before Katrina. And last week's survey by the Conference Board showed something of a drop in shopper enthusiasm. Households say they intend to spend a bit less this holiday season than last.   Consumer spending is now more than three-quarters of the whole national economy - a record high. There's nothing left to spend. Yes, gas prices have settled down a bit, but so have paychecks. General Motors, Merck, and major airlines are laying off tens of thousands. Job growth is anemic and pay is lousy. American families have exhausted all the coping mechanisms we've been using for years to spend more.   The first coping mechanism, which began decades ago when mens' hourly wages first began dropping, was for spouses to go into paid work. But now that most adult women are on payrolls - including even the mothers of toddlers - this strategy has generated just about all the cash it can.   How else to pay for more spending? The second coping mechanism has been to work longer hours. This past year, the typical working American put in two full weeks more at the office or factory than was the case two decades ago. Americans are now working harder than even the notoriously industrious Japanese. But we've reached the limit. I mean, we have to sleep.   Which brings us to the third coping mechanism - taking equity out of our homes. Last year alone, Americans pulled out $600 billion through refinancing. But this cash machine is also about depleted because housing values have leveled off and mortgage rates are rising.   Where else to find the money? The final coping mechanism is to go deeper into debt. For five years now, American households have spent more money than they've earned - pushing their debt to a record high. But we've hit the wall here, too, folks. Interest payments on all that debt are exploding.   On top of that, there are tens of millions of baby boomers within sight of retirement. They have to start saving, or else their twilight years will be spent in darkness.   Put it all together and you see why we're running on empty. We're busted. We've exhausted all the coping mechanisms for spending more. Our buying binge has to come to an end.   The only question is whether the binge stops before Christmas shopping season, or American consumers make one big, final, irresponsible splurge over the next three weeks, and then call it quits.   Robert B. Reich was U.S. Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, and co-founder of the American Prospect magazine. He also offers weekly comments for NPR's "Marketplace." The above is his most recent commentary.     
 Now I know why the Delta, Memphis, St Louis, and Chicago all claim to be the "birthplace of the blues"!  Honeyboy Edwards & Co made their mark on all these cities 
 Californication is a simply amazing album by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They try on many different styles here in this album, and seem to excel at all of them.   The opening song on Californication, "Around the World", is a great funk tune. Many more such songs can be found here, such as "Get on top". The driving bass of these songs serves as a steady foundation on which John Frusciante lays down an array of memorable guitar riffs. These fun tunes seemingly lay a foundation for the ups and downs of this album.   The beauty that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have created in their mellow songs is astounding. They take elements of their funk such as the driving bass and drums and combine it with beautiful choruses and guitar to leave you in awe of their musical genius. The mellow pieces of this album, such as "Otherside", "Scartissue", and "Californication" will remain with you for a long time.   Another interesting style is an acoustic Zeppelin-esque tone in "Road Trippin'". The Red Hot Chili Peppers make this style their own by taking their mellow style tunes and layering it with acoustic guitar and a symphonic backdrop.   This was my first Red Hot Chili Peppers Album, but it certainly will not be my last. I definitely reccomend this album to everyone, because what sets this album apart is not that it contains so many different styles, but how the band can seemingly take any style and make it their own 
 Who actually saved Western Civilization? Authors have recently brought forth many claimants: the Irish, Islamic Spain, the Jews, homosexuals. One well-known author has written a semi-serious book titled "How the Plumber Saved Civilization". In "Sailing from Byzantium", Colin Wells makes a learned and convincing argument that the scholars of the Byzantine Empire deserve the true credit.   The subtitle "How a Lost Empire Shaped the World" may be an audacious one, but it gives the reader a good idea of just how comprehensive this small-format book intends to be. Most histories of Byzantium focus on either the military dynamics which slowly strangled the empire until only Constantinople remained and then itself fell to the Ottomans, or on the religious schism with the papacy that has not yet been closed. Wells treats those subjects well with fresh insights. But military and the religious divide play supporting roles to his true focus: the scholarly life of Byzantium and how it was spread to Italy, to Islam, to the Balkan nations and cultures, and, most vitally, to the emergent Russian power.   The author divides the book into three parts. In the first he covers both the preservation by Byzantine scholars of the fundamental works of Greek civilization and then the wave of humanist teachers that brought this learning to early Renaissance Italy. In his second section, Wells treats what was actually an earlier but not so permanent development: how the Arabs absorbed Byzantine learning as they conquered and settled in what had been Byzantine territory.   In Part III, the asserted civilizing power of religion takes a more dominant role as the author treats the interactions with the various Slavic migrations. His claim in the Introduction is that "the Byzantines turned the ... Slavs from uncivilized invaders into the great defenders of Orthodox Christianity." Of course the Russians were the most successful of these "Slavic invaders", and Wells' long discourse on how Russia came to be "the third Rome" could well be considered Part IV of the book.  While ideas and faiths are his main topics, Wells embodies and organizes his treatment by focusing on a long line of personalities. This is unavoidable, but the long stream of short biographical sketches of the key players, many of them unknown to non-specialists, could overwhelm. Thoughtfully, Wells has included for reference a list of "Major Characters" and a "Concurrent Timeline". This latter is especially helpful, as the text itself pays only minor heed to chronology. There is also a fine Bibliography, covering both primary and secondary sources. There are nine good maps.  Wells does not pretend to original scholarship in this book, but for most readers it will present many new and thought-provoking facts and interpretations.  A final note: although military history is not the main thrust of "Sailing from Byzantium", it cannot fail but touch on such events as they played such a large role in how Byzantine culture rose, spread, and fell. The reader may at times wish for a more comprehensive focus on this aspect. If so, I can recommend "Byzantium at War" by John Haldon. 
 Molvania, a fictional Eastern European country, is the brainchild of Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro, and Rob Sitch.  They parody travel guidebooks.  This book describes the country as "the birthplace of the whooping cough" and "owner of Europe's oldest nuclear reactor, i.e., any Eastern European country.  The story is so good that I can believe that tourists reading the tour guide actually believe that Molvania existed and made travel plans.  The descriptions are accurate and without this country actually existing, I do believe that during my discovert of Eastern Europe, I have visited almost every single city described in this book.  This book is warmly recommended for anyone who has ever traveled to Eastern Europe or someone saited with the dry wit and self-assured criticism of Lonely Planet and their ilk 
 This book was so different from what I thought it was about when I ordered it.  It still was knowledgeable.  It is hard to grasp as you must actually do the experimentation.  I also thought the illustrations should be in color since that is what the book is about.  It has some examples in the beginning of the book but I hate to keep looking around in books I personally like it to appear in front of me as I read.  It was a very interesting book to say the least 
 If you are a fan of turn-of-the-century literature as I am, you will find this narrative a good read.  I had never heard nor read anything about this Hudson fellow until I recently began to read "The Sun Also  Rises", which, as you may know, is Ernest Hemingway's first novel.   Hemingway nonchalantly mentions Hudson and the travels of Lamb briefly in  his story.  I was intrigued as I gathered Hemingway himself had read the  book and apparently liked it well enough to mention.  Or perhaps I am  mistaken.  Regardless, this book is really as series of tales of adventures  in the jungles of South America.  You meet the natives, the food, the  lifestyle and the beautiful girls (as you might expect; latino woman are  notably lovely, in my experience).  It should be noted, however, that the  author, being a product of his times no doubt, is not particularly  sensitive to political correctness 
 This is a great resource for any theological library.  Whether you agree or disagree with what Hume writes, this book is `a must' as you wrestle with faith and epistemic certainty.  It is used in many theology and philosophy classes and will aid any reader to become more familiar with a different perspective on the origin of religion, the Enlightenment struggle with reason and faith and the broader conversation of contemporary epistemology 
 Set in post WW II Hawaii, "A Little Too Much is Enough" chronicals the life experiences of a young Chinese-Hawaiian woman growing up in Honolulu from the perspectives of various members of her extended family. A very rich, colorful, highly ethnic portrayal of Hawaii's development into a major tourist location and that development's effects on the native population. Several core incidents and experiences are told, and re-told, through severl different voices and perspectives, yeilding a rich texture in which one comes to savor the totality of the experiene's effects on the entire Wong family. Delivered in a highly vernacular Hawaiian voice throughout, "A Little Too Much is Enough" in the end stands as not just a wonderful story, but also as a rich, multicultural experienc 
 I highly recommend Gerilyn J. Bielakiewicz's "The Only Dog Training Book You Will Ever Need" which gives you the A-Z of raising those cute but oftentimes unruly pups. The book is written for novices in mind and had been a major life-saver when I was at a complete loss as to what to do when I adopted a 3-month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi (a notoriously difficult breed to raise) a couple of months ago. The book delves into the highly effective method of clicker training for dogs at length, resulting in my teaching my pup over 10 commands in just days (!). Betsy Brevitz's "Hound Health Handbook" is also another excellent reference book which offers credible advise from a writer-turned-vet behind the award-winning website, .... These books are must-read for owners who are experiencing problems in obedience training and/or understanding their dogs. Prospective owners who are contemplating what breed to buy and the pros and cons of adopting a dog to complete their lives and homes will also find them useful. "Puppies for Dummies" is another book written with the novice in mind: it offers practical clues like playing classical CDs on repeater mode while owners have to leave their dogs alone; to not make a song and dance when owners have to depart for work or retire to bed(no-no to "grandiose departures/returns gestures"); to what to look out in dog food labelling et al. 5 Stars for their comprehensive contents, readability and effectiveness! 
 This book is well written, but it is not much more than an extended newspaper article. Gabbard enjoys himself opening up some interesting lines of thought and giving an overview to the series. Well worth a look 
 i think this book is one of the best art books available on the market. Every section is divided by the artist and it's explained in a very complete way and very simple to understand at the same time...a real dilight to your mind and a strong pleasure to the eye!! 
 This book was about a girl who has to go to oregon with her family. She has to go through deaths and hardships along the way.I like the fact that her father was so understanding and nice plus it didn't hurt that they were from Arkansas. My favorite part was seeing the romance between the kids. It was good that they were going through such a hard time and could still party at night.I liked it when she flashed back to when her dad was making pottery instead of being sick.all in all, it's a good book 
 My 3 yr. old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair.  He doesn't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair.  The babybjorn is a bit expensive.  I found a similar chair at Ikea for a fraction of the cost.  
 One of the best novels I have ever read.  This book has everything a good read should:  characters that become real to the reader, a wonderful sense of place, a sense of history and knowledge.  Not only do you get completely wrapped up in the world of Vine Sullivan, but you also learn more about yourself in the process.  A truly beautiful book that I can't recommend highly enough.  I've bought a copy for everyone I love 
 Front cover says it is a Bible handbook but it is also like a commentary. I like it as a study guide as I am reading the bible. It give an excellent overview of every book in the Bible. A very user friendly book to help you understand the Bible. I like it. Check it out and I think you will want to add it to your collection 
 After years of hitting my head against the wall in total frustration, I *finally* found the right cartridge for me in Audio Technica's AT440ML (now the AT440MLa).  Let me explain why life was so frustrating, depressing, and difficult before the 440ML.    All my life, I was mystified and upset by the fact that the inner grooves of most records sounded distorted and/or sibilant.  Some records in my collection had inner grooves that distorted so harshly it rendered them unlistenable.  I'd track down new or minty copies of said albums, assuming my LPs must be worn or something.  But no, even brand new copies would often have at least a little sonic degradation on those last tracks.  Despite being an avid vinyl junkie, the fact that I couldn't find a way to remedy this forced me to wonder if I should concede defeat, admit that maybe vinyl *is* the inferior medium, and start replacing some of my favorite albums with CDs.   Over the past few years, I grew increasingly determined to solve this problem.  Affixed to my Denon DP-51f, was a Grado Gold, which had a wonderful sound but it couldn't track the inner grooves of a record if its life depended on it.  The Grado's performance could best be described thusly: 1st three tracks sounded positively beautiful, confirming all that is good and glorious about the sound of vinyl; full, rich, detailed, and a smooth, pleasing, lively sound.  Fourth track begins to show signs of degradation, maybe some sibilance, a bit of distortion, but usually still listenable.  But that last song on the record would often sound terrible; sometimes a heinous, distorted, muck-ed up nightmare.  It still stresses me out just thinking about it.   I replaced that with a Shure M97xE, which came with recommendations from nearly everybody in the audio world, even some hardcore audiophiles.  Right away, I was impressed with its full sound and flat, almost warm frequency response.  But once again, it just couldn't track those inner grooves to save its life.  It did do a slightly better job than the Grado, but I thought that overall, the Grado had a better, sweeter tonal quality on the tracks that it *could* track successfully.    Meanwhile, I acquired a Technics SL-1400, which came with a Stanton 680 HiFI that was somewhat unimpressive, but worth noting because of its strange problem with sibilance in the *outer* grooves.  Yes, it actually did okay (better than both the M97xE and the Grado Gold) with inner grooves, but for some reason the outer grooves were absurdly sibilant.  This one had great difficulty with wide grooves, especially 12" 45 rpm EPs.    Briefly, I acquired a Rega P3 with the Rega Elys 2 cartridge.  The venerable Rega had a nicely detailed sound, but once *again*, performed just as badly as the Grado and M97xE when tracking the inner grooves.  That's right, an extremely reputable $700 turntable and a $250 cartridge made zero improvements as far as trackability!  It sounded great on those first 3-4 tracks, but still rendered those inner grooves distorted and sibilant.  To be fair, the Elys isn't the best cartridge in its price-point, but still - $250 for a cartridge that can't track inner grooves?  Are you crazy? How can Rega live with that?   Enter the AT440ML, which I first connected to my Technics.  I got out several of my favorite "problem" records; those LPs whose inner grooves always sounded atrocious.  Right away, the AT440ML tracked the inner grooves like a champ.  For the first time in my life, the inner grooves of these records sounded as lush, full, detailed, and clear as the outer grooves.  Inner groove distortion had vanished!    But it doesn't stop there - gone too were the sibilant "S's" that once sputtered and spat through my audio system.  Now suddenly, the "S's" and cymbal hits were as smooth as silk on all but a handful of particularly problematic, sibilant records.  And on those few records, the sibilance was still reduced significantly when compared to the above mentioned cartridges, bringing these few LPs into the realm of listenability.    I'm now hearing details in some of those inner groove tracks that I never heard before due to the newfound clarity brought by the AT440ML.  Records that previously sounded abysmal are now sounding full, rich, and clear.  Words can't describe how happy this makes me.    One criticism leveled at the AT440ML is that its frequency response is too bright, that there is a bump in the upper frequency range, causing excessive treble or brightness.  While there is a slight bump, on my system it is very subtle and in no way excessive.  I tend to like things a bit flat sounding, so I was concerned that this would be an issue, but as it turns out, the AT440ML sounds fine.  I would describe it as pretty natural sounding, with well-defined yet full bass, smooth yet detailed highs, pleasing mids, with amazing attention to sonic detail.  It's also quite lively; the music really jumps out of the speakers (something definitely lacking with the comparitively dull sounding M97xE). So, not only does the 440ML track perfectly, but it really sounds great.    So, if like me, you've been plagued with so much inner-groove distortion that you've just resigned yourself to live with it, I would highly recommend the AT440ML.  If you do find the slight high frequency bump not to your liking, I would suggest changing your phono stage or nudging the treble down on your eq. Fortunately for me, that wasn't an issue at all on my system.    How manufacturers like Grado and Shure can continue churning out cartridges that fail to track inner grooves cleanly is beyond me.  I can't recommend this cartridge highly enough.  From my experience, it wins out over anything in its price range with ease, and even cartridges over twice its street price.  
 My daughter's teacher read this book for her in class and she couldn't stop talking about it.  While I thought it was supposed to be hardcover, I received a paperback, I probably didn't read the description well enough.  That doesn't take away from what a great book it has already become to our home and the fast arrival time 
 I hadn't done a dot to dot puzzle since I was a kid but got this book on a whim. I was pretty surprised! Some of the pictures are pretty intricate. On the other hand, a few are a little lame. But most are very cool. I've gone through all the "Greatest Dot-To-Dot book(s) in the World and they're worth it no matter what your age. Good for everyone, either sex. Really enjoyed all of them 
 Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara is the focus of Errol Morris's award winning, engaging documentary "The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara." The film's up-close and personal approach to its subject offers an interesting and chilling look at America's foreign policy during the years 1961-1968 when McNamara served as the Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson. The film also traces McNamara's pre-Washington, WWII career as an officer in the Army Air Force's Office of Statistical Control. Here he analyzed and improved the efficiency of U.S. bombing missions.   While ostensibly analyzing McNamara's 11 Lessons of War, the film also examines the underlying moral questions surrounding war--is war justified? Is it avoidable? And--in hindsight--is it worth the cost?  McNamara frankly admits "any military commander ... has made mistakes", and on camera McNamara discusses three main points in American 20th Century foreign policy--the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and of course, the Vietnam War. While McNamara was not involved in the decision to drop nuclear weapons, he states that this was unnecessary and "not proportional." He discusses his role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, claiming that he knew nothing at the time about America's attempts to assassinate Castro. The Cuban Missile Crisis serves as a good example, however, of Lesson 1: "Empathize with your enemy." McNamara argues that it took Tommy Thompson understanding Khrushchev to decide how to respond to the Soviets.  When it comes to Vietnam, however, McNamara is much less of an apologist and much more slippery. In hindsight, it's easy to see the Vietnam War as totally unnecessary, but McNamara argues that the Vietnam War was an intrinsic part of the Cold War. At the time, 'saving' Vietnam from the communists was an imperative, but now, of course, that just seems nonsensical. But ideology aside, chilling pivotal archival footage of conversations between McNamara and Kennedy--and later Johnson--reveal that these men knew full well that Vietnam was a hopeless war, and yet they all sent men as fodder to the war machine for years. McNamara had misgivings about the war very early on and privately stated his dire reservations while publicly describing it as a "battle to win the hearts and minds of the people." These diametrically opposed opinions--private and public--illustrate the moral dissonance of those puppet masters who directed the Vietnam War "on tyranny and aggression." No doubt if politicians were required to fight these wars, they'd create swift, diplomatic conclusions.   The interviewer is remarkably soft with McNamara, and when tough questions are asked, McNamara illustrates his inherent nature as a politician. Lesson 9: "In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil" offers marvelous opportunities for the ethical examination of war situations. McNamara jocularly explains a rule he lives by: "never answer the question asked of you. Answer the question you wish you'd been asked." McNamara illustrates his point by failing to address questions regarding the moral consequences of his actions, and even manages to speak of himself in the third person at a crucial moment. Still, in spite of McNamara's evasiveness, the documentary offers a unique opportunity to interview one of the architects of the Vietnam War decades after the fact, and asks: "what were you thinking?" The viewer will draw conclusions from both those questions answered and those questions studiously avoided--displacedhuma 
 Lynne did three sets at the 2004 Monterey Jazz Festival in, in my humble opinion, the perfect setting for her music, a small(circa 250 seats)darkened room, and the experience was mesmerising. She communicates feelings and emotions magnificently via beautifully crafted and performed compositions, most of which are original. I bought this record afterwards as she had played most of the tracks. Sit at home with the lights low and you will not experience a better jazz pianist.  
 eleanor clift's latest book Founding Sisters is her best yet.  it is not only informative and insightful, but also beautifully and eloquently written.  i think it is important for women in this country to know our history and to honor those women who  fiercely struggled, fought, and were in some cases even martyred so that our voice could someday be heard.  for those who find ms. clift's book indolent and her research remiss, they should check again. if they are at all honest with themselves, they must admit that there were a lot of facts stated in this book that we (especially women) absolutely should have known, and because of our own complacent ignorance have never taken the time to explore.  we need more women like eleanor clift to remind us of our history and give feminism a much needed resuscitation.  this book defines the true meaning of girl power and sisterhood 
 This has been one of my favorite cookbooks for a realistic approach to baking!  Real recipes with very few rare ingredients and everything so far has been fabulous!  
 This is probably the best self-help/happiness book I've ever read (and I've read many.) Some readers could be dissapointed because there's not some magical secret that the authors reveal to guarantee happiness - it's more about changing your outlook on life and appreciating what you have. But the advice and exercises the authors provide really work!  This book is written in VERY plain language. No psychobabble, you won't even find mentions of "attachments" or "enlightenment" as are present in many happiness books. Each chapter follows a similar format: 1) An introduction to the idea of the chapter. 2) Examples of three people who suffered from the problematic ways of thinking that the  chapter is teaching you to overcome.  3) An in-depth analysis and description of the ideas of the chapter. 4) A follow-up to show how the three people mentioned earlier used these ideas. 5) An exercise to help you get started with this way of thinking. 6) A closing and a bulleted re-hash of the main ideas of the chapter.  The authors also pepper the chapters with MANY examples from movies or books to exemplify the ideas they're trying to explain.   The only two drawbacks I found in the book were: - it seemed to be geared more towards a middle-aged crowd. I'm in my 20's and most of the examples were people around "mid-life crisis" age. I could still use the ideas presented in the book but many of the examples didn't really apply to my life. - In the Introduction of the book the authors explain that their use of "God" can mean whatever you want it to (Jesus, Allah, Buddha, Life Force, etc.) But they do use a few examples from the Bible and when they speak of God they are clearly talking of the Christian God. This could be an issue for some readers and I think the authors could have left out some of the Biblical examples if they are really trying to appeal to a wider audience and if they truly stand by their disclaimer in the Introduction.  Despite those few issues I strongly recommend this book! It can really change your outlook on life, and yes, make you happier.  
 I consider myself to be a high intermediate/advanced exerciser.  None the less, I had a weak upper body, but my arms were still toned.  I was able to do 3 pushups from my toes prior to doing this workout.  After about a week, I'd moved onto 9 -- and after a month, I was up to 24.  This workout has done a lot for my arms!  My arms also firmed up a bit more than they were before (and that wasnt my focus).  Chestwise, I think this workout did a lot for me.  It lifted my chest area a bit.    I feel stronger in ways I had never really thought possible.  So, as you can probably tell, I LOVED this workout.  I'm not as advanced as Cathe! She was lifting some pretty heavy weights!  I did just fine and felt my arms burn/get warm and tired with 5 lb weights.  I should be moving up to 8lbs soon.  My arms are already pretty toned-- but I can see this exercise as helping out if you're lokoing to keep in shape or get into shape.  This is my first Cathe dvd --  but as an instructor-- cathy is energetic.  She's not too hard to keep up with and she gives really great direction as to what you're supposed to be doing-- how to know what sized weights to use.. she reminds you to listen to your body.. etc.    Keep in mind.. this is not cardio-- but it is good for your inbetween days or if you have a ton of energy.. maybe after cardio?  This really depends on you.  I do suggest doing something to warm up before doing weight training.  (I do this dvd once a week one the days I do not do my FIRM dvds).  Now-- This is a GYM STYLE workout.  After you learn how to do what Cathe teaches you, you could potentially do the same thing in a Gym.  It's not dancy at all. It's right down to business.  I usually hate going to the gym for the sole purpose of weight training-- however, for some reason, this dvd really hit the spot for me 
 I read this delightful book as a child, but wanted to re-visit it as an adult. I found the story just as entertaining, though now I also realize the 'educational' value. Besides teaching me about the Great Lakes Region when I was just starting to grasp the mysterious power of a compelling tale, the book fed an already awakened sense of exploration in my adventure hungry spirit. I hold this story close to my heart, not only for the fond memory, but as an important piece of my early childhood. Chrissy K. McVay author of 'Souls of the North Wind 
 This is an excellent book.  I bought this book for my daughter who just got engaged.  I would recommend this book to any couples who are getting engaged or getting married or married couples 
 I found this book to be very helpful, and I refer to it frequently when I see a new species at my feeder. I like the way it lists the seed preferences for each bird.  It is a very interesting book and has been very  helpful to me in attacting backyard birds 
 I grab for this cookbook every single time I need cook.  I did not know how to cook before this book.  Left the crinkle skin on the garlic when I made salsa... Yuck!  Heck, it wasn't spelled out in the recipe so I didn't know...  This is how bad I used to be.  This cookbook explains, in intimate detail, just about anything and everything that is in the kitchen, including food and utensils.  The recipes are simple and made from things most everyone will have in the kitchen.  This is NOT a dieter's cookbook as most recipes call for a large amount of fat.  In our mouths, fat is responsible for most of the taste.  If loosing weight is your goal, you will need to find a different book, or you will be disappointed.  If you want simple, tasty, flavor-filled recipes that even a beginner can follow, this book is highly recommended.  I have made everything from pot roasts, to birthday cakes, to punches, to grilled shrimp and BBQ rubs.  I have yet to be disappointed.  Best of luck and Bon Appetite!  I LOVE THIS BOOK 
 Very nice reading. I laugh with every book I read by this writer. He keeps me entertained and speaks some truth with the main charactors. Loved it 
 We love this item, it's easy for the kids and everyone who visits asks us where we found them. They look cute in the kitchen too! 
 Very well done.  I was moved, cared about these characters and did not want the novel to end.  I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.  
 If you love great acting, memorable dialogue, unforgettable scenes that stay with you since the 1979 movie debut, and if you adore socially conscious films where the underdog outwits the oppressor, then Norma Rae is the film to return to.  Based on a true story about a Southern textile mill and attempts by a northern union organizer to form the first union, Norma Rae is fiction, not fact. Sally Field (b. 1946) as Norma Rae won a well-deserved Oscar in her embittered battle against hardnosed union management who turned a blind eye to the legitimate complaints of their long-suffering workers: excruciatingly high noise levels which deafened some employees, cotton fibers at the mill which caused lung disease, and scant wages barely higher than a sweat shop's for backbreaking work that literally killed some of the mill's loyal employees.  Management didn't care. After all, they were the only company in town. But Sally Field, egged on and smitten by a union representative from New York, brilliantly and subtly played by Ron Leibman (b. 1937), was a pawn in his hand. Had she not met Leibman it is doubtful that she would have risen to power in the never-named southern factory, which is really the famous J.P.Stevens out of North Carolina. The movie was filmed in Alabama.  The delightful culture and sense of place of the South is evoked, including choirsinging in churches, fire & brimstone preachers, and baking of delicious pies. Since I'd seen the film when it first came out, I was awaiting my favorite moment, one of the great moments in all of moviedom:  the suspensful climax where Field climbs up on the table holding out a sign reading Union and turns round and round until each employee shuts off the deafening machine he or she is working at.  A viewer can't ask for anything as tearjerkingly emotional as that!  Field's character, with poor self-respect and children by different men, evolves into a character with dignity, thanks to her platonic relationship with Leibman. When her husband asks, "Are you sleeping with him?" she utters the classic lines, "No, but he's in my mind."  That happily clinches the relationship for Field and her husband, endearingly played by Beau Bridges (b. 1941 and son of Sea-Hunt Lloyd) and he vows to love Sally all the more.  Feisty, fervent, and flamboyant describe our riveting heroine, a true joy to behold, with her skinny sexy body that, to me, anyway, seems to long for her Jewish mentor and teacher, Leibman, the man who has opened her eyes to the larger world of culture, books and catching your dreams. For him, she begins reading one of his favorite poets, Dylan Thomas. He's had the power to change this plain woman with poor morals into a strong outspoken survivor.  Is Leibman just using her to get the union started? No,they part with genuine respect for one another, sealed by a handshake. An earlier scene shows them taking a delightful skinnydip together. Leibman is always a calm force to Field's tempestuous behavior.  However, it may be that socially conscious director Martin Ritt (1914-1990) blacklisted during the McCarthy era, just may have been using the real Norma Rae - Crystal Lee Sutton - since she didn't receive a cent from the film. However, Crystal states in later interviews she enjoyed the film and the attention.  In a memorable line, Leibman asks, "Why is it all you southerners have three names?"  Watch the movie to experience the thrill of defiance and winning. Watch it  to root for Sally Field to take on the establishment and, glory be, to win 
 So it is, Seneca observes, it's not that we are not given a short life, but that we waste a lot it.  Life is long if you know how to use it.  How stupid to forget our mortality.  "Live immediately."  Perhaps better known for his tragedy OEDIPUS,  Seneca (Lucius Annaeus) (AD 4-65) was also a Stoic philosopher.  His reputation as a philosopher is derived primarily from his twelve books of MORAL ESSAYS and philosophical letters. The Stoics emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and equanimity in the face of adversity, and believed that virtue is attainable only by living in harmony with nature.  Although he may not rank with Plato or Aristotle as a philosopher, or with Marcus Aurelius (121-180) (MEDITATIONS) or Epictetus as a Stoic sage, Seneca nevertheless offers us timeless wisdom for living a meaningful life. (It should be noted that this review refers to the 2005 Penguin Great Ideas edition of ON THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE, translated by C. D. N. Costa, which includes the three essays, "On the Shortness of Life," "Consolation to Helvia," and "On Tranquility of Mind.")   G. Merritt  
 This album is a classic;; does that are mariachi lovers should have it; does that want to know and learn about mariachi music and wonderful songs should have it..  its a great production.. 
 "The DNA Detectives" is an engaging look at how the science of genetics can be used to solve zoological, anthropological and historical mysteries.  Were the Neanderthals the ancestors of modern day humans, or were they a completely different species that could never interbreed with homo sapiens?  Could scientists someday clone dinosuars?  How about a more recently extinct animal, like a wooly mammoth or a giant moa?  Was the Black Death caused by bubonic plague--or was another pathogen to blame?  Did the "Lost Dauphin" survive the French Revolution?  Did Princess Anastasia escape the Bolsheviks?  DNA offers the answers to all these questions and more.  Meyer's book offers fairly current solutions to these mysteries.  At the same time, the book is light enough that it makes for quick and entertaining reading--the short chapters and paperback format make this an especially good book to enjoy on an airplane flight.  If genetics and history interest you, try Nicholas Wade's superb "Before the Dawn" (what DNA tells us about human evolution in 2006) or Sean Carroll's "The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution."   
 Having been in the small business area just like Mr. Stephenson is talking about for many years, I feel that I can say his book is pretty good. Just a couple of points I want to add. Under Buying Sources, don't forget: thrift shops, particularily sales at thrift shops. Here one of them is half off every Friday. buying overseas. No you don't have to be big. You can find small suppliers of specialty items that are not imported into the US and bring them in.   Under selling venues: <BR>don't forget Affiliate programs from companies like Amazon. They have a tremendous marketplace and handle all the paperwork. <BR>And the internet is very, very important, go take a class on how to do a web site.   Under business organization: <BR>e says that the biggest reason for incorporating is that you can greatly reduce your own personal liability. I've never found this. Any good lawyer that wants to sue you can frequently get around the corporate shield. <BR>He also talks about the double taxation of a corporation, you file as a Subchapter S corporation and this doesn't happen. And you can create your own corporation, look for the book Ultimate Guide to Incorporating in any State.   Business License: Eventually you'll need one, but I have found that towns and cities are sticky about granting licenses to individuals who want to work out of their house. Furthermore enforcement is rare, and there are basically no penalties if you get caught - but you may want to check on this in your area.   Finally he lists some 202 things you can guy and sell for big profits. No question that in evey one of these things someone has developed his own business. But just pick one or two of these things, if they can be combined, you can scatter yourself too thin 
 I read this book and it developed on how my mate and I react and play with each other.  It was a great beginner book and it taught me that there is more than one way to entice an evening, morning or any time of the day.   Have fun with it!  I sure did 
 Most of the songs are great; I didn't know I knew them, but when I heard them, they were amazing.  A couple left something to be desired, however. Overall, though, it was a great CD 
 I enjoy reading mysteries and have read quite a few in my time, but I've never before come across anything like "The Woman in White." I'm always a little skeptical when I hear a book being described as a page turner but that description fits this novel to a tee. I found it very hard to find a stopping place each evening and lost more than a few hours of sleep, but it was definitely worth every minute!   I don't want to give away too much of the plot but here is a very brief overview. Walter Hartright is a drawing instructor who has been engaged by Mr. Frederick Fairlie of Limmeridge Estate to tutor his niece, Laura, and her half-sister Marian Halcombe. On his way to take up this appointment Walter encounters a woman along the road, a mysterious woman dressed completely in white. He offers his assistance to the woman and soon after they part he discovers that she is an escapee from a mental asylum and is being sought by the local authorities. Walter travels on to Limmeridge but his experience with this mysterious woman is far from over. Upon his arrival he is surprised to discover that Miss Laura Fairlie bears an uncanny resemblance to the woman in white. This amazing story of deception and mistaken identities takes off from there and the suspense doesn't let up until the final pages!   One of the things that is so gripping about this novel is the way it is written, in the form of a narrative told in turn by each of the major characters. It is almost as if they are giving their testimony about the incidents to a jury in a courtroom. One character narrates the story to a certain point and then the next person takes up the story from there and so on and on. It's just such a good book and so hard to put down. Mr. Collins was a genius in the way in which he brought everything together. The ending is terrific! This is definitely one of the best mysteries I've ever read. Don't miss it 
 I've had this book for several years now and I continue to go back to my favorite stories in it when I want a little... inspiration. I really like Lonesome Highway a lot and Your Wish is My Command. The book absolutely covers a wide range of erotic desires, but one of the best things is how well-written the stories are. There is a great piece by Marilyn Jaye Lewis and a fine one by Dante Davidson starts the book off with a bang. I've read Naughty Stories 2 and 3 and both are hot, too. But this one remains my favorite. For other good collections, check out Sweet Life and Sugar Lips edited by Violet Blue, Lust by Mariyn Jaye Lewis, and Five-Minute Erotica by Carol Quee 
 The pocket-sized book is very convenient -- easy to carry around and use. It provides a good guideline for protein grams, but as with most references of this nature, the listings can only be regarded as rough estimates. It  does succeed at least in giving us an idea of which foods to gravitate  toward if we are seeking high protein meal choices 
 What you do get is a great collection of U2 video's from "Achtung Baby" to "All That You Can't Leave Behind", with a few "odds and ends" "Electrical Storm", "Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me" (from the Batman sequel), "The Ground Beneath Her Feet" (from The Million Dollar Hotel), and "The Hands That Built America" (from Gangs of NY), "Miss Sarajevo", but no "Elevation", found on the first "Tomb Raider" film, and no "Walk On"? 2 versions of "One" make it on here, but the famous "buffalo" version doesn't?   When will Popmart and ZooTV be on DVD as well as 1980-1990 and "Under a Blood Red Sky"? Somehow the "Making Of Unforgettable Fire" has been released instead.   And where's the Surround sound?   With all these complaints, I still give it 5 stars because of what IS on there. A vast majority of the music videos they did in that time period, and a lot of extras. I listen to it more than I watch it, but it's one I'll put on frequently enough to give it repeated viewings. The 90s were a major change of pace for U2, taking the band to a whole new level, and the collection reflects it.   Essential? Absolutely. Room for improvement? Always. 
 This is the first of the vintage Wodehouse; his previous books are for completists, or public-school story fans, only.  Like his earlier work, the plot is still weak (I'm not even sure he had the ending in mind when he began writing), and the two dei ex machina don't really work.  But, as in brief parts of the earlier _Mike and Psmith_ (a.k.a. _The Lost Lambs_), the style and characterization--especially of Psmith--start to show the true Wodehouse genius.  In particular, Wodehouse starts to make use of his perennial low-style/high style apposition, here usually with Mike and Psmith, later most famously with Wooster and Jeeves 
 I like the Ghosthunter series.  This book was too short though.  I liked how they eliminated the ghost.  You should get this book!  Ethan age 1 
 I started with Danny's GU London set.  Had Disc 2 bootlegged (sorry Danny) long before I actually purchased it at an auction site (sorry again, Danny, as you don't see a penny either way).  That is perhaps the greatest GU disc out there.   It was inevitable that I'd find his Athens set.  Got this one at a used CD shop (and, once again, Danny doesn't see a penny out of this...why all the fuss over Morpheus and Kazaa when the artist doesn't see a penny of it after the intial sale?). Ok, tirade aside, this is a phenomenal set.  I would imagine it was even more phenomenal when it first landed.  Both discs are fantastic but Disc 2 is the more consistent.  Disc 1 has some great moments (Moody is a prime example) and is a great way to spend an hour or so.  But Disc 2 can't help but be great with it's opening with Seduction to rope you in.  By the time it lands on Feel Free (perhaps THE definition of anthem) you're about ready to jump out of your skin.  It's a tremendous effort.  I don't quite go for the five stars having been spoiled by his London set.  There are traces of what would be on the London set - the experimentation with percussion, for example - but there are some moments here that just drag.  Not many, but just enough that it's noticeable.  Trivial, either way.  Start with either set and you'll hear why Danny is one of the most talented and innovative DJs to have ever hit the scene.  Seems to me that many a DJ thanks him in their liner notes for his inspiration.  That's about as high a compliment as you can get.

 Frankly, I was considering buying this short story because of WHO the author is: a man who has written some of the greatest STAR WARS material, not to mention NEXUS.  But then I saw the cover picturing that spiky-haired, adorable dog and the equally spiky-haired (adorable too?) author and I couldn't resist.  I just had to have this short story.  Am I ever glad I did!  This is an adventurous caper worthy of a TV series.  Hoss is as lovable and smart as any dog I've ever met (and he reminds me of my friend's dog, Miss Dolly, who is nuts about her Auntie Betty).  Hoss's master, Brian, is quite likable himself, even if he is a career criminal bent on stealing from an "old folks" home.  Brian gets involved with a conniving old geezer who has bigger crimes on his mind. ...  Oops, don't want to give too much of the plot away, so you'll have to RFY (read for yourself).  I promise you'll be highly entertained by this exciting, rather humorous adventure of men and beast. - Betty Dravis also wrote Amazon Shorts, V.O. and The Search for Bobby McGe 
 It is with gratitude and relief that  I study this translation of the Dhammapada. The simplicity and bareness  of  the language allows the truth beyond the words to slowly penetrate my body and spirit. I am carried by the rhythms and substance of the phrases to ever-deepening understandings. This is the most accessible translation of any sutta that I have been privileged to read 
 And of course he gets nowhere. This is the most accessible and "normal" novel by HM that I have read so far. I love them all. HM uses Western themes, stories, bits and pieces and transposes them into his Japanese environment. It is true Pop-Culture, literally and literarily.  The narrator is an end 30s man who tells about his own youth, the time at college, his friends, love affairs, problems with student politics, with Japanese society (which seems amazingly similar to ours in many respects). Any outsider in a German university during the "rebellion" of the 60s could have told much the same story, including Beatles references and other cultural secrets. Was it HM himself that he wrote about? Completely irrelevant question 
 I am quickly becoming a fan of the Dover Thrift editions of classic literature. They are well-made, sturdy, and a great bargain. All of them that I have bought and assigned to my students have been $2.50. What can you buy for $2.50 anymore? Now you can have an entire library of unabridged classics at a more than reasonable rate.  Jonathan Swift's "Gullivers Travels" is no exception to the rule. This brilliant 18th century satire endures to our times. Swift, in turns, attacks (in his subversive way) makind's vanities, follies, cruelties, and morals. The floating island crushing the lower island is still, to my mind, the best attack on England's merciless domination of Ireland.   Some readers think: "I've heard so much about this book, but I didn't think it was so great." Certainly, our expectations about something that is considered a classic may outweigh the book itself. Please put aside whatever you might have heard and approach this book with an open mind. You will see it for the monument of English literature that it is.  Rocco Dormarunno College of New Rochell 
 Its the best tin can book in the whole world and I love it with my hole heart.  This book helped me to make different arts out of tin even thought I am a poor crafts person!  Its a must have!!! 
 This is an antique classical course.  It's main purpose is to train the student to write on par with Joseph Addison. It requires The Spectator by Joseph Addison.  I found The Spectator in two volumes on Alibris, excellent condition, J. B. Lippincott Company 1890.  You're to read a piece by Joseph Addison three times and then you attempt to write what you have just read.  Thus it's important to find a copy of the The Spectator that doesn't have any editing by Joe Blow.    You're expected to know Latin and it is assumed that you do so.    There are interpretations of the Latin at the end of each chapter but it is disruptive.    It's excellent.  I highly recommend it.  I also recommend the simplified Christian dialect that is the present fad and learning material from Memoria Press to start the Latin.  
 My boy brought this home the school library and the title of the book intrigued me. What is it like to swim by swishing your tail, round and round, in a small little bowl; or, eating fish flakes sprinkled from above when the person decides it's time to be fed; or to live in an environment that deteriorates day after day into murkiness until you are suddenly scooped up by a net and put into an even smaller container while your bowl is being cleaned? What IS it like to be a fish? Alas, there are no answers to that question found in this book -- pity.   But ontological musings aside, this book is a good little read for kids who, for the first time, are interested in having a fish as a pet. The book uses the common goldfish as its example. It shows the different environments in which a little child might encounter a fish: a bowl, an aquarium, a plastic bag being brought home from the pet store and swimming around in a backyard pond. It also tells what the different fins are called, how do fish sleep, are they warm or cold-blooded, how do they breath water when I can't, and similar questions a young child might ask when they have their first fish. It tells you how to set up a goldfish bowl and why you put the bag in the water for awhile without setting the fishies free. Basic stuff for the adult, good for the child who shows interest in having a fish pet.  Now if only that title-question was answered.. 
 Golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game. For these types, nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course, but Golf Digest comes very close. This magazine contains over 200 pages each month, dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf.   The things that set Golf Digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews. Other golfing publications attempt to help you learn, but they often get too mechanical. Golf Digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals, including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like Tiger Woods.   Besides all the tips and tricks, Golf Digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game. This personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine's overall appeal, providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine.   Golfing Digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course, but it comes close. I consider it the best publication of its kind and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game.   
 I loved it and plan to use these recipes as a cook off the shores of Anitgua next winter on a 72' classic wooden yawl 
 This is the best book on No Such Agency--period.  Bamford's update of his previous Puzzle Palace is controversial, information dense, and an exciting read.  For those of us who served in Sigint during the Cold War, it'll bring back "fond" memories. (Thanks, Mr. Bamford for mentioning my unit at Mount Eckstein).  Communications intelligence, and related collection endeavors are the backbone of our collection and analysis, and while we have recently come up short in the area of HUMINT, (Human intelligence) the plugged in man in the little black van is still getting the goods on the bad guys, and providing us with the right stuff. Bravo Bamford 
 I read the book...the next step for Neverland in Peter Pan in Scarlet. It was rather morbid in comparison to the Magic of the original book. I would like to have seen the story come with more magic to it. To give the characters some light and HOPE of a grand return. I would not have liked to have visited THIS Neverland as described my Geraldine McCaughrean. Dead and Dying exist to much in a sequal of one of the most cherrished childrens classics of all time. I did like the creativity and the writing was superb, but what makes the book grand is the Plot and Characters. Ravello was a new twist I thought was great, but to end up with the Villian Capt. Hook as he, was very predictable towards the end. 
 Written in the early sixties, the play frequently  abbreviated as Marat/Sade is set in 1808, yet many of the comments are distinctly directed toward current events,  notably the upheavals in Eastern Europe. Now, with the  fall of the Soviet Union behind us, the play takes on even  greater significance. Despite the reassurances of the asylum  director, whether a mere fifteen years or well over two  hundred years have passed, the nature of revolutions, and  the fanatics who cause them, has not changed. Combining   historical events with modern theatrics, Weiss has produced  what has been and will continue to be one of the most   disturbing, as well as one of the most important works   ever to be performed on stage 
 This book probably should not be treated as "capitalist manifesto" a la Marx but more like an attempt to present a position opposite to famous Galbraith "The Affluent Society" (1958). Reading the book without reading Galbraith first creates an impression of cheap advocacy of capitalism and unrestricted market almost in best libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) style. But as a polemic with Galbraith vision of post-capitalism (post-industrial society) the book looks like an interesting historical document.   In his book Galbraith stressed that to become successful, post-WWII America should invest heavily in infrastructure (highways, phone infrastructure, etc) as well as education using funds from general taxation and government intervention. At the same time he felt that the government power should be balanced against the power of capitalists using some countervailing forces (he mistakenly assumed that unions can play such a role). He also noted that large companies are actually exempted from competition on a national level because they are closely linked with the state and competition is limited to small companies (and most of their profits are expropriated by banks, landlords and state). In essence he argued that the USA society is no longer a capitalist society but some different dualistic social organization that combines elements of socialism (planning) for the largest firms and government (macroeconomics) with limited "free market" capitalism for small fish (microeconomics). Many argues that GM troubles proved that Galbraith was wrong. But if you look at GM problems it's clear that it was not national competitors who squeezed Detroit.   Friedman definitly was the most intellectually astute opponent of Galbraith post-industrial society vision. He pointed out that the great virtue of the market is that it enables people who hate each other to cooperate economically. But most of the content of the book is detached from reality and looks like a draft of yet another utopia. Sometimes the level of radicalism of this advocate of "free market" suggests that he is closer to socialists (especially Trotskyites) then conservatives and from defender of "status quo" turned into promoter of a new and dangerous social utopia, a new economic messiah who preached that free market + fiat money used with a specific rule of money stock expansion (3-5% per year ) will save mankind. Freidman's libertarian-style absolutization of the market ("In Goldman Sacks we trust" using Galbraith catch phase) as well as advocacy of fiat money (he played a role in the USA unilateral withdrawal from gold standard) in a way makes Friedman's views very similar to Marxists (extremes meet), although his utopia proved to be definitly less costly for mankind. It's funny that the latest administration that proclaims "market, markets" and praise Friedman actually behaves more like "Military Keynesians" then "free market" advocates. The same was true for Reagan. Still it was during Reagan's years when conservatism had grown into more and more dangerously utopian social vision ready for dangerous experiments with society.   Freidman's arguments that planning is unnecessary and that market forces have built-in checks and balances and can do wonders if they are freed from any and all government intervention can be understood seriously only in context of polemics with the representative of the opposite extreme views (statists). For readers in 2006 and especially European readers it's clear that Friedman's views of the market are anti-historic and "free market" described in the book never existed and probably will never exist in human history. Market never exists in vacuum and always is intrinsically connected and always experience significant level of control by the government (level greater then roles of an arbiter of disputes and the provider of the currency presuppose). The opposite is also true and market tend to influence government in many ways, especially dangerous if there are large national firms which depends by-and-large on government contracts (military industrial complex). Some proposed in his book "solutions" like eliminating medical profession licensing in the name of free market are pretty bizarre.   It looks like the main problem with Friedman's book is that unlike Galbraith he did not understand the importance of balancing government power with the freedom for market forces. Extreme positions that proclaim advantage of a single social force always look extremely dangerous. For example if everything is just a "free market" why buying politicians should be prohibited ? Is not this a discrimination against free market? (the same question is applicable to judiciary). What about the danger of natural creation of heredary elite by market forces and resulting "natural" conversion of parliamentary democracy into oligarchy (like "Iron law of oligarchy" presuppose) ?   Failing to address those problems makes his book mostly irrelevant for the reader in 2006, but still important as a historical document that criticized Galbraith views (it was Galbraith who coined the term "countervailing power".) Today we face the fundamental question: at which point "laissez-faire" capitalism/"unrestricted market" and associated with it corruption of government should be stopped (and some too hot and/or crooked practitioners probably jailed) and where and when unchecked state powers expansion should be stopped (preferably with similar type of punishment) to prevent sliding of society into also stagnant and completely corrupt version of "well developed socialism, Brezhnev's style."  Society probably needs to deal with the market the way tennis players deal with tennis racket: if player holds it too tightly his game suffer, but is he/she holds it too loose he cannot play well either. In this respect "former socialist countries" were not so much socialist (the famous joke in the USSR was that any "capitalist" European country contains more communists then the whole USSR) but countries with too powerful and unbalanced by any other forces government. And it was probably the internally grown oligarchy and not initiated by Reagan arm race (" military keysianism") that eventually defeated communist party control of the state, the oligarchy the was naturally created by the state after WWII and consisted to a large extent of party members in high positions. They were direct beneficiaries of the system collapse that happened with blessing (and probably financial help) of those oligarchs under the weight of economic problems and siege of nationalist forces. In a way we can believe in the "theory of convergence": both unrestricted "free market forces" and unrestricted government control eventually lead to the rule of oligarchy.   I am not an economist but it looks very strange that an avid advocate of "free market" is at the same time a proponent of demonetarization of gold and usage of fiat currencies. In this sense his Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (often incorrectly called Nobel Prize in Economics) looks somewhat strange. With fiat currencies  all businesses are hostages of the government.  And the ability to switch money printing press to full speed any time the government finds convenient (usually to cover war expenses) provides an easy way of confiscation of wealth of people by government without any communist coup d'ï¿½tat. How stable is the world of fiat currencies remain to be seen.   It should be noted that lately Freeman himself abandoned his "monetarist views" (and that makes chapter III, one of the central chapters of the book just a historical curiosity). But unfortunately Britain already serves as a guinea pig for his utopia. As for implementing his and other economic utopias I like the quote attributed to German Iron Canceller Otto von Bismarck about suggestion of one of German parliamentarians to implement socialism; I do not remember exact wording but it sounded like this: "OK let's do it, but let's first choose for this experiment a country, that we do not care about". 
 Anna is in the south again - but this time on one of the islands off the coast of Georgia.  And she's not 'wrastlin' gators this time, it's turtles instead.  There's a plane crash, Bambi (real name, Flicka), cannibus (marijuana), and more.  She's still contemplating moving to Chicago to be with the distant Frederick, but that possibility seems to always be on the backburner. As usual, Nevada fights the good fight, goes skinny dipping, gets her hair cut, and is finally free of her ex-husband (in a hilarious manner), while discovering the the secrets of Cumberland Island's murders 
 This book was extremely helpful to me and it gives me great hope to know that there are drug free alternatives that are safe and effective.  I highly recommend this book 
 Thank you for a speedy delivery and the nice new condition of the text 
 Despite the unfavorable comments in "A VERY POOR EFFORT," I decided to buy this book and try it for myself. I'm so glad I did. This reviewer seems to be confused about this book. Of all the books on the subject, this is the only one that's written by a Pulitzer-nominated architectural historian, comprised of all-color photos, inclusive of the late-20th and 21st cent styles, designed like an art book, and packaged in a compact/portable format for taking it on the road. These 5 features are completely NEW to this genre! The unhappy reviewer's other point of criticism (that there are too many trees on the property of some of the photographed houses) is simply absurd. How can a photographer remove trees and foliage from a house's property before photographing the house? These houses are important examples, not slouches. The book states clearly that each picture was taken from public property. Should the photographer have given each house a fresh coat of paint, too, before he photographed it? Such a criticism is illogical. For my dollar, this is the best book in the genre and thus should be given a fair evaluation. I'm glad I bought it. As a realtor, I need this kind of book, and this one's the easiest to use of all of them. 
 The best book to date! What other book would you buy? [Ray Zee has a good book.  David Sklansky talks of 7-stud in his other great books. But they both help write this very complete book on 7-stud.]   When you know the basics, this is a book for you. I play stud, online and in casinos some. This book confirms and expands my knowlege of when to stay and fold.  For instance, great book for third street (your first bet). When will I make money, I have three hearts (9, 10 Queen) and a Ace has already raised. It will tell you what to do.  Read this book and play for free online. You will learn fast.   The book has specific examples. It covers all of 7-stud. If you are a beginner, skim this book, it is too compicated for you. Then play for awhile and re-read. If you are intermediate, this is a perfect book for you. It will expand your knowlege fast and as deep as you want or need. If you are already advanced, learn to plug a specific leak in your game  and use the index and table of contents for reference. The question and answer sections are good too. This book has it all.   NOTE: Their (Two Plus Two Publishing with David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth) other book is on Hold'em. It is one of the top five books out of the hundreds on this subject. (The best 1st book on low limit hold'em is by Lee Jones). 
 This fragrance took me quite by surprise when I first tried it from a magazine sample, so much so that I knew I had to try it at a department store - this was a little over a year ago. Then I sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was "Wow!" - gardenias from my grandmother's garden, the suntan oils & tropical perfumes that I smelled as a little girl at the beach, with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual - I knew I had to have it! I bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my X-mas list, which my sweet & generous boyfriend got for me.  In my opinion, this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that I have ever smelled. I feel very alluring every time I wear it for my boyfriend - and he loves it! So this would be a great gift for a man's wife or girlfriend, or for a woman's best friend, sister or cousin (as long as you wear it for your own man, too!), but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother, aunt or grandmother - it's that enticing. But if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts, then have it given by one of her female friends, sister, cousin or "Santa". That way there won't be any awkwardness at gift-giving time. Believe me - this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of French lingerie or a string bikini!  
 I have an elderly mother who is blind and has Parkinson's.  The big knob on this radio is a Godsend.  She can easily tune and control the volume.  I have hunted for a radio like this for months, and she is very happy.  If the sound was just a little better, I would give it 5 stars; although, she is happy as a clam, and the price is great 
 really good bird book lots of interesting facts but just too big to take out in the field! 
  An excelent quick reference book. Quickly kills the old myths about cannabis, without all the mumbo jumbo of a overly complicated research book. 
   I have owned a Brita water pitcher for over 20 years. When my old pitcher ended up getting broken, I searched far and wide for a replacement and was elated to find the Ultra Max Brita Water Pitcher through Amazon.com. I am very satisfied with my new pitcher and its new improved design. I hope to enjoy this one as long and hopefully longer then my last one 
 The item was new like advertised, but took a couple weeks to reach me.  It is a school book and put me behind in the class 
 Love this series of books. Looking forward to the next one already! 
 "Living on the Fault Line" is like a diorama of a new battlefield. Reading this book, like studying the scale model, should give the experienced leader new perspectives on which troops to deploy and where  they should go. It is a tool to show the terrain, the high points and  ambush risks that armies face. This market is not lacking in people who can  act, and this book shows them where to focus their efforts in a usable,  timely and concentrated way 
 Who better to write about behind-the-scenes of a soap opera than a former soap star!  Go, Finola!  This book is a fun read from start to finish.  Like the TV soaps, it has everything ... glamour, intrigue, love and sorrow, with big helpings of humor!  Not to get all "soapy" on you, but I looooooved it.  I hope this author writes more ... and soon. 
 If I was to spend the rest of my life on an island and was told I could have only one cd, I would not hesitate to choose this cd.  The rhythms, vocals and arraignments are so beautiful the listener will be carried away.  This will remain a part of my collection always 
 An absolute spellbinder.  A must read for anyone looking for the history of what is now going on in the region.  The author is well grounded in his subject, and this book is a real page turner 
 I am currently in my second year of college in biomedical engineering... and I almost cried when I found this book was still in print.  When I as younger, my mom used to read it to me every night before I went to bed... I'd climb into her bed and she'd read it to me.  By the time I was three, I had heard and seen the words so many times that I was able to read them.  The stories are delightful, and bring back so many fond memories.  I was looking for a birthday gift for a two year old, and now I'm going to get two, one for her, one for myself.   Oh, how time flies 
 This is an absorbing, very well written, gripping--in a  subtle sort of way--novel that tells the tale of the final disposition of a woman killed in a terrorist incident in Israel.  The woman, when finally identified after a long interval through a newspaper story on her--turns out to be the employee of a large bakery in Jerusalem.  The owner of the bakery, distraught over the woman's plight and the possible ill effects her situation could have on his business, directs his director of personnel to deal with the situation.  This ultimately leads the personnel director to Russia for the woman's burial.  There are elements of obsession here in that the woman is by all accounts beautiful, intelligent and charismatic yet the personnel director, who on fact interviewed her, has no recollection of her at all.  His attention to duty here has as much to do with his developing obsession with this corpse as it does with his professional obligations.  At its core the novel is an examination of the role of character in a violent urban world.  The woman is the only person throughout the entire novel ever identified by name--everyone else is only a role or profession.  Attached to this person in death the personnel director strives to identify and quantify her life before he achieves the final disposition of her remains.  On the whole I was very impressed with this book right up to the ending, which was anticlimactic and unfulfilling in the extreme.  It's very frustrating to be taken in by a page turner--which this is--only to be totally frustrated in the end.  Had this book ended more satisfactorily I would have given it a fifth star.  I've never read Yehoshua before but this novel was enrapturing enough for me to give some of his other efforts a try.  Hopefully he's not going to turn out to be the master of the inept ending. 
 If you are a massage student, therapist, or teacher of massage therapy, you should buy this book. It's the best book written on body mechanics. It provides all the information needed to sustain a healthy massage career. The burn-out rate for massage therapists is too short; this book will help to eliminate it 
 This book has changed my life in more ways than one, and also my way of thinking.  Joyce Meyer has spelt out in her own words simply how we can maintain a closer walk with God and attain the Holy Spirit dwelling in our lives completely for as long as we want.  With obedience and the hunger and longing in our hearts, it can be done.   This remarkable teacher brings a wealth of experiences to us readers, and what I like about her teaching is that she never fails to share with us readers, her past failings and how she has overcome them through great courage, praying and listening to God.  And, she was also willing to take criticism and analyse it.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand these deep messages meant for all who crave this wonderful intimate relationship with our Father Almighty God.  Some of the messages inlude: God's Manifest Presence God's Transforming Power God Reflecting Glory God's Everlasting Fruit  May you who have chosen to read this book, find the ease and burdenless travel to the intimacy of Our Heavenly Father's throne.

 We have the Discover Sounds Kitchen (which is great) so I decided to try this toy. It is not nearly as interesting as the kitchen but the girls do enjoy the ball drop and the nails. I think it's a decent toy for the price, but I wish it had more interesting parts to it. 
 This book is about how a boy grew up in a mexican culture. The struggles that he faces throught out his childhood .  This book is about short stories that this young boy goes through and how impacted him.  After  reading the book you will be able to make the connections from each short  story.  Each story reflects how this boy is prejudge just by his  etchnicity, how he tries to overcome and how important his parents are to  him.  This is probably a good example of experiences in which many  people  faced when coming to a different country.  Not only mexicans but all the  people around the world in general.  It usually happens when you are trying  to bring your own culture to a different land or country different from the  one you used to live in.  It has very good details in which you will be  able to have a mind movie of the events that are happening through out the  book. You will be able to understand it and picture it while reading it.   While reading the book you can easily understand a little bit about mexican  culture and how they try to get used to the new country and adjust. This  book is available in spanish as well and if you are bilingual it will be a  good book to read 
 Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice and Loyality is a book written by an economist but accessible to all - a rare achieve in any academic disipline, especially economics.  The book was written in the early 70's but still has  relevant today.  Its greatest achievment is the illumination of 'exit' as  the mentality of modern western capitalist societies - the idealisation of  the consumers' right to 'vote with one's feet' - and its spread into all  forms of social activity.   Hirschman adds a historical dimension to this  by arguing that the whole of the United States has largely been built on  'exit' mentality - from the mass migration out of Europe from the 17th  century onwards to the calls to 'go west' across the plains.  Exit is the  strategy advocated today by neo liberals as being the manifestation of  democracy in the market sphere.  Hirschman's observations were made in the  early 70's, yet their relevance as an internal critique of the free market  is perhaps even more important today in the post-cold war era when the  traditional critiques of the capitalism (such as Marxism in its Communism  manifestation) have so clearly failed. As liberals try to grasp the future  - while opponents of liberalism turn their attention from Marx to Nietzsche  (such as John Gray), Hirschman's Exit Voice and Loyalty is an accessible,  refreshing and insightful look at market liberalism from within, and is  therefore throughly recommended 
 To Life! is a heartfelt book that serves as an introduction to anyone who wants to get reacquainted with Judaism and reconnect with its roots and core ideas; it's meant as a book for anyone, even non-Jews who want to get an idea of what Judaism is about.  Keep in mind that Kushner is a rabbi from Judaism's Conservative movement, so the perspective you're getting is largely from his take on Jewish observance and belief, though he does make efforts to show you the Reform and Orthodox perspectives as well.  And more importantly, he conveys to you certain ideas, cultural values, and beliefs that tie all Jews together, regardless of their level of observance.  He covers the holidays, the Jewish approach to life's milestones (including a very poignant section on loss), the Torah and some of the rationale behind its regulations, and also the Jewish approach to some great moral and theological questions.  The book is not meant to give you all the answers, but to inspire you to think and do more reading and more searching.  Kushner writes with a full heart and an open mind; this is a man who has lived through difficult and painful experiences, and yet still takes joy in life, as Judaism encourages one to do - to make holy and blessed the ordinary moments of life 
 I read this book because as the mother of two sons (so far), and having been raised in an all-female environment, I felt I needed more insight into just how boys best learned things.  I also taught for ten years prior to my marriage and motherhood.  During the last three years of my teaching career, I taught in charter school where a lot of parents sent their sons who had been having difficulty in other schools.  At the time I didn't have a great deal of knowledge or insight into just what was causing them problems.  I had been trained under the typical hymn to the evils of masculinity, how important it was to "soften" our educational system, et cetera ad nauseam.  I bought into that for seven years. How else was I to know?  My upbringing, while definitely not in the strict sense "feminist", was confusing, as I was taught that my ultimate job in life was to be a wife and mother to the point that even my attendance at college was frowned upon, yet men and their ways were generally disparaged.  So I entered adulthood with a very skewered view of how things ought to be.  Then I married my wonderful husband, who very patiently has helped me to understand the male psyche and what motivates him over the years.  During this ongoing growth period, I found "The War Against Boys" and knew I had to read it.  What I read answered all my questions as to why my students were doing poorly and why parents were bringing them to me hoping I could help them learn.    I wish I had read this book earlier, as I think I would have been better able to serve my young students.  As it is now, I am alarmed at the possiblity of my children encountering what Mrs. Sommers relates in her writing, and consequently my husband and I will spare no sacrifice to see to it that they receive a truly orthodox education.    We also have a daughter, and if you have girls, you still must read this book.  Our daughters will be harmed greatly by the degradation of our sons.  They will not have successful marriages and will not be able to raise sons themselves.  In short, all parents must understand that they must raise their sons to be men and their daughters to be women.  It is my hope that my daughter will see her brothers as equals, yet as heroes, showing them respect and honor, as they will likewise see her.    Mrs. Sommers is only one of our reasons for our decision to homeschool or seek orthodox, hopefully single-sex Catholic schools for our children.  We are definitely leaning more towards homeschooling -- I know our children will never, ever set foot in a public school as their primary source of education as long as we are alive and breathing

 James Brown has always been my favorite, but I was never able to find much of his music in the CD era before the internet exploded.  Unfortunately, it took his death to remind me of how much I liked his sound.  I've been on a buying spree since.  Usually, after you get through the best 5-10 hits an artist has on one greatest hit collection, the rest is hum drum filler.  I have to say that in the case of James Brown, the more I find the more I love the man!!!  He is truly the progenitor of Funk and hip hop.

 I don't know why people are flipping out and saying this box-set sucks. The only thing I can agree with is that there isn't a LOT of special features, but come on. It's called Thundercats: Season 1-Volume 1. And that's exactly what it is.  It has the first 33 episodes of the series featured on six discs, so that's about $1.40 for each episode.  Where else are you going to get these classic cartoons? Each story has a great moral, and the animation is amazing considering the series is over 20 years old.  If you're looking for some kind of new and improved, remastered, dolby surround sound DVD with 10 hours of extra features, don't bother with this set. Each episode looks just like it did on TV, and the only notable problem I had with the set was during the 1st episode, the picture kind of went off the screen for a second or two.  I'm glad I got this set, and when I have kids, they can watch this instead of that "Kids Next Door, Billy and Mandy, and Ed, Edd and Eddy" garbage on tv right now.  This DVD set is great, and I plan on getting the other 3 sets after I finish this one 
 Some critic once described AMADEUS as a "love triangle with God at the apex". The same could be said of AFFAIR. You know how some desperate people resort to making a deal with God? "Grant me such-and-such a favor, God, and I'll do such-and-such for You." That behavioral cliche is the premise of AFFAIR.  I was impressed by the narrator's hateful jealousy: "I got no reply and then I gave up hope and remembered exactly what she had said. 'People go on loving God, don't they, all their lives without seeing Him?' I thought with hatred, she always has to show up well in her own mirror: she mixes religion with desertion to make it sound noble to herself."  But I was downright nauseated by Greene's Catholic monomania. Whereby spirituality always gets to be represented by Catholicism. Even Sarah's mother turns out to be a Catholic. Why couldn't she have been a Presbyterian or a Druid? Just to break up the monotony 
 More than ever, it has become imperative for the West to understand the Arab world. Warriors of the Prophet chronicles Osama bin Laden's ascent to power during the Islamic Afghan resistance to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Author Mark Huband reveals the important role bin Laden played in uniting the Arab Muslims with their Afghan compatriots and spreading the ideology of the jihad, or holy war, to protect Islam, to all the various Islamic factions that took part in the war in Afghanistan. Although a number of recent books address the rise of fundamentalist movements in the Islamic world, none attempt to explain to general readers the emergence, character, and significance of that revival, nor do they bring together the many voices dividing both conservative and liberal currents in the region. I found this book extremely useful and quite compelling - a surefire way to get at the Middle East "problem" and ways in which we can do something about it. The tone is fluid yet serious, just the kind of perspective I needed. I recommended this with great confidence

 Agent Barletta gives us insight into the 40th president in a way that only a horseback riding companion can.  Horses seem to be great equalizers that allow those who ride them to form very special bonds with their fellow riders.  Barletta clearly shared this bond with President Reagan.  I thank him for sharing that closeness with all of us and allowing us to experience those special times and a very special president 
 The GOOD: Adds a touch of class to the kitchen. Very attractive piece. Nice chrome finish. Very techy looking...the pictures don't nearly do it justice. And I like the way it drains out the water into the sink. Very cool.  The BAD: The dishrack portion holds just that...dishes. No bowls of ANY depth, no pots or pans of any kind...no lids for your pots/pans...unless they have the aproximate depth of a dinner plate. Try to stick those things in there and they'll lean forward on the next object in front of them. I guess I'm disappointed because our old crappy looking rack held these items firmly in place. The utensil rack is made of semi-transparent plastic with drain-holes. I have no idea what this thing is going to look like after several months of us dumping knives and forks into it.  Still...I like it. We'll try to make this work ;-)  How it can be improved: Re-design the dishrack to accomodate some items with slightly greater depth than a dinner plate. Replace the plastic utensils holder with something that won't get scratched up. Or...just make it bigger. Add 3 inches in depth, 2 inches in height. Then you'd have the king of all dishracks 
 An Unlit Path is extremely well written and certainly hit home with me.  The story was hard to read because of the realities of the family's situation.  With that said, the book brought moments of hope, faith and joy into the family's experiences.  I recommend this book to everyone, not only foster and or adoptive parents and child welfare social workers.  Others need to know the realities of foster care and adoption and understand their roles as community supporters, law and policy makers, etc.  Thank you to Deborah Hannah for taking the risk and writing this book

 This last of 3 volumes in Deutscher's biography caps an astonishing and captivating historiographical achievement. Deutscher weaves together character study, drama, and historical narrative to give an authoritative account of Trotsky's tragic final years, as the great leader waged a rearguard ideological struggle in the face of an avalanche of Stalinist harassment, slander, repression and murder. Simultaneously, Deutscher lays bare the blunders and disasters of the Communist International under Stalin's leadership, making clear how inexorably these failures followed from Stalin's deadened bureaucratic-centralist  socialism.  Deutscher's deft handling of the facts, personalities, ideas, and situations of the time is simply unparallelled, and makes for a tremendously enjoyable and informative read. His account of Trotsky's last hours left me in awed tears.   Essential material for anyone exploring the question of where socialism went wrong in the 20th century

 I have to say, I love this recording partly because it was one of the first jazz LP's I ever bought. As a teenage guitarist, bored with rock players, I went looking for some jazz guitar. When I saw the original cover, with Burrell holding a big fat D'Angelico archtop guitar, I snatched it up. Jazz aficionados will recognize the Prestige records sound from the period -  kind of a jam session, the players probably had minimal rehearsal time, very bluesy, very comfortable with the music -  just as they'd recognize the Blue Note sound of the same period. The playing is excellent on all counts. There's a beautiful duet -  Coltrane/Burrell -  that's worth the price of the CD by itself. Coltrane fans probably don't need this CD if they have other Prestige Coltrane, unless they want to hear him sharing the spotlight with a guitarplayer. Flanagan is good but maybe takes up too much solo time. Guitar players though,  definitely should check this out. Burrell was consistently Downbeat guitar player of the year back in this era, and this recording contains some of his nicest, extended soloing I've heard. In subsequent years, Burrell's playing lost its teeth (for me at least), in favor of elegance, though he still remained a great player. 
 Let's face it.  Most sales people we come in contact with drone on about what they think is gonna make you buy.  Wahburn and Wallace have revealed profound conclusions of what customers want to hear, based on hundreds of research questionaires conducted with customers of highly successful companies.  I've been in sales for 17 years and I gave up on reading sales books because they were not helpful. This one is different.  It immediately helped me improve my presentation that I've been giving for the last 11 years.  I thought it was as good as it was gonna get.  Wrong.  I'm making more money and saying what customers want to hear.  Even better, more customers are saying what I want to hear.  Buy the book.  You won't regret it 
 I have heard about DISC before but have not read through the concept, so this is actually my first DISC book. DISC is a behaviour profiling, based on an old concept of human behaviour. DISC devide people behaviour into 4 types: D (Driven), I (Influce/Sociable), S (Steadfast) and C (Concientious). D and I are extrovert, and S and C are introvert. This is a commercial type of behaviour analysis that is now widely used. This book use the bahaviour reading of our customer and custom set our way of treating that customer. In short you should treat certain type of people with similar trait of type to influence them into buying your products. This book is easy to read, and useful to implement, even if you are not a sales person. If you like popular psychology applied into business life (books like INFLUNCE in your top liked book) than this one is for you. This is the way we use science of psychology into business life 
  Innovative when first issued - for its combination of b/w photographic images to enhance the feel of the Chinese text, this text still exudes a unique sense of 'presence.' Even the sequel by the same duo (Gia Fu Feng/Jane English)dealing with Chuang Tzu - couldn't match it. Such techniques have since become common place, but the Gia Fu Feng/Jane English Tao Te Ching still represents the best of its type, in my view.    I note the qualifying blurb 'Text Only' - attached to this reprint. I dearly hope that I am misguided, and that Random have not reprinted the book minus Jane's wonderful pictures. If the text has been robbed of its pictures, the editors at Random should be ashamed of themselves and apply for civil service posts, because it represents the ultimate in crass philistinism to sever these excellent pictures from the text as originally conceived.    Alas, I suspect that this act of editorial 'murder' has been perpetrated. Random-Century (the English wing of the company) has had a kind of publishers' 'death-wish' for years, cutting corners and costs, with tomfoolery of this sort. If you have to, order a good quality used copy of the text with the photos: you wont be disappointed. Compare it to the reprints, denuded of the pictures - and do the world a favour. Convey your sense of offended artistic sensibility and disgust to the publishers, who may yet return to the land of the living.        
 A good book to help people to understand some of the elementary principles of creative thinking

 There were things I really liked about Cover of Night. The characterization was sharp, the pacing was excellent, the motivations were logical, but somehow it failed to come together and engage me. It read like a book adaptation of a movie. I never invested in the emotional life of the characters, even as I respected their situation and the reactions they had to events. The major plot point required a massive suspension of disbelief. One thing I greatly appreciated was that the suspense was without horror elements. Too many romantic suspense books of late have relied heavily on graphic and almost sexual descriptions of violence, especially violence against children. Early in the book you learn the heroine has twin boys. Right away I'm bracing myself for yet another 'children in extreme peril' storyline. I should have trusted the author more. Worth a paperback purchase, certainly. As a hardcover I'd think twice. 
 Bob Bly's "Copywriter's Handbook" is an instant classic that all aspiring copywriters should read - it's a "foundation" piece in which Bob teaches everything needed to understand how to craft winning ad copy.  Bly's book is also instantly usable, as his techniques are easily applied to any copywriting situation, whether it be online copy, offline advertising, or any other "salesmanship in print" situation that you wish to succeed in.  Excellent book, highly recommended.  -Ken Calhou 
 In 39 crisp chapters covering more than 700 pages Ryding organizes both the grand lines and essential details of Arabic language structure and grammar. This is a highly readable, easily searched linguistic reference. The index really does the job and her list of references alone is a significant academic contribution. Finally, this gem will make life easier for both students of Arabic and researchers. All my thumbs are up for this once in a lifetime linguistic treasure 
 The cover gives 14 color examples. The 78 pages are packed with  an average of 8 black and white outlines to a page.  This is a lot of ideas but would be challenging to enlarge for  pattern making. A limited range of symetric styles are divided into four groups. 
 Lucy Wickwright, an orphan whose parents mysteriously died, is sent to Castle Cant after living with her uncle for a very long time. While at the castle, she is assigned to be the servant of the Baron's very spoiled daughter Pauline. She proves to be too perfect for the job. She never lies, always performs her duties, and takes the blame for her mistress.  Through her curiosity and detective work, Lucy quickly discovers that Castle Cant isn't the peaceful place it appears to be. She learns that Vladmir Orloff, the Commissioner of The Posts, is cooking up a scheme that could place everyone in danger. She also discovers that the people who mysteriously died were her adoptive parents. Will Lucy be able to stop Orloff's deadly plan before it's too late? Will she ever discover the truth about her real parents, or will that secret remain in their graves forever?  H.P. Bath brings THE SECRET OF CASTLE CANT to life by magically creating eccentric characters and places, while at the same time making readers realize that motivation, courage and friendship aren't created through a writer's imagination.     --- Reviewed by Ashley Hartlau 
 ...It is beyond the shadow of a doubt, the best book I have ever read. I am retired, and reading non-fiction books about the Vietnam experience is what I like to do best. In the year I've been retired, I have read as of 5/8/03 between 75 and 80 books all relating to Vietnam and what these people went through. Mr. and Mrs. Hall's book "I Served" is without a doubt the best I have ever read. In all honesty and truthfulness, I can't imagine a better book to read. It has more to offer than any book, and I loved every word of it. The writing has a way of making you feel like your standing right there watching it all take place. It is a very rare quality to be able to write like that. I honestly feel if Mr. Hall ever wanted to, he could be one heck of an auther, and probably could write a good number of book's and have before long, a following of faithful readers. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone over any other book I have ever read. I would like to say, Please check this book out. It's not an expensive book, it's worth is far greater than any amount you would pay for it. I can guarentee, you will love it the same way I and everbody else who read it does. This is a book you will be sorry you didn't read. And that's the truth. So help me God. From his day's in an orphanage, to the end of his tour in Vietnam, Mr. Hall reveils so much about himself that other people wouldn't want anybody to know. It is so honest and forthright as to put it a league all it's own. I will keep this book for as long as I live. And I will hope and pray that my two son's find the time time read it. I know it will have a positive effect on them both. And I'm sure it will have the same effect on you. You won't be sorry you bought and read this book, so please do for your sake 
 Thank you, Mark Asher, for "Old Friends". You make our appreciation for our wonderful companions come to life with your outstanding photography. The pictures and "longivity secrets" provide a daily dose of joy to my everyday life. Of course, I did show you book to Drake, my 16 year old.

 For a while I had heard very good things about this particular trash metal band so I did my best to get the original release which I was able to find on ebay for 30 bucks. So I finally get it and what do I get once I pressed play? nothing but 80s dinosaur worthless junk which I was told would sound like heavy metal legends Atreyu, My Chemical Romance, Hawthorne Heights and As I Lay Dying. These dirty long haired 80s hippies did not have any cool breakdowns and aren't even up to date with the lastest teenage style what with the girl tight pants and the hair flaps. This crap also made me realized how much the 80s sucked and all the music that came from that era 
 I'm pretty surprised this book has not been reviewed here for the reason that it is all the things my title-heading suggests.  Soames begins this work with a review of Moore, and it is appropriate that he does so.  One of the lessons that Soames tries to bring out with the history of analytic philosophy is the Moorean idea that common sense wins out over any philosophical theory that produces consequences incompatible with common sense (e.g., that there are bodies).  Following is a review of Russell, particularly his theory of descriptions, his logical atomism, his reduction of math to logic; followed is work on Wittgenstein, particularly his Tractatus; the positivists; and finally a look at Quine (esp. his famous "Two Dogmas").    This book is not for the philosophical novice, esp. the section on Russell's reduction of mathematics.  But, it is for advanced undergrad students who will be able to grasp most of the material, and those already established scholars.  Soames not only does a nice job reproducing the arguments and the historical context in which the arguments are set, esp. in a clear manner, but he gives what appears to be cogent responses to the material covered, often trying to recreate the original arguments in order to make them better.    I think this is a great work to have handy if working through the early 20th century pieces; and I found it especially helpful in trying to figure out Wittgenstein.  I highly recommend this work as a supplementary piece for teaching the history of analytic philsophy, or the chapters on Quine or Moore (if, say, teaching an epistemology course).  I wish I had this available to myself as an undergrad and plan on requiring it of students when I have the opportunity.  
 We got this in a gift bag from the hospital and it works wonders, BUT becarefull it uses subliminal messages instead of the right words to the songs. I AM SERIOUS! It says stuff like "baby will sleep alnight sleep allnight " on the london bridge song, but other than that it's a god send 
 "Pork Chop Hill" from 1959 is a grim but riveting look at an actual battle, near the close of the Korean War. Lewis Milestone, who already had left quite a distinguishable mark on Hollywood, directed this, his third entry into what may be considered his anit-war trilogy. "All Quiet on the Western Front"(1930), his academy award winning look at the horrors of WWI, and "A Walk In the Sun" made in 1945, his WWII entry, were the first two.  Gregory Peck stars as Lt. Joe Clemons, who is ordered to lead an Army Company to hold "Pork Chop Hill". The hill is  insignificant to the outcome of the war, and not only that, but the war is all but over. Knowing this, the men are not exactly gung-ho to risk their lives. They are pinned down and outnumbered by the enemy, shells going off all around, they lack water, food, medical supplies, communication is practically nil, and were also taunted by psychologically destructiove messages, broadcasted by the Chinese. There was great loss and sacrifice of life and limb, yet the powers that be, commanded they "hold that hill". And so they did.  War Buffs and Film Buffs alike will well appreciate the authenticity of the battle, and the superb way it was shot. The black and white cinematography, adds to the starkness and bleakness of the situation these infintry men faced. Peck turns in a masterful performance and the film is also known for so many young talented actors involved that would go on to be stars and great character actors. The cast includes, George Peppard, Harry Guardino, Rip Torn, Woody Strode, Martin Landau, Harry Dean Stanton, and Robert Blake(who oddly enough can't seem to find his gun). And that is just to name a few.  It's an eye opener and wonderful tribute to these Korean War Heroes, who didn't get quite the attention or accolades of those from other wars. A must have addition to your Gregory Peck, or great war films collection.   Enjoy...Lauri 
 This bar tastes pretty close to a dessert bar.  I would buy it again 
  What an amazing book to read.  This is the first of 3 proposed biographies on T.R.; the second being "Theodore Rex".  It centers on the life of T.R. before he became President, describing a life so dense with excitement that one year of his life is more compact with interesting events and accomplishments than many years of most other people's lives probably are.  If you are looking for a biography on Theodore Roosevelt, this is a MUST READ.  In fact, this book reads more like the most entertaining novel you could find, and in my mind is a must read regardless of whether you are looking for a biography about T.R. or not.  It is THAT entertaining to read.  I could not put it down amongst a weekend of nothing but "lounging around, lazy-crazy reading".  It was THAT good.  Overcoming obstacles, the underdog that wins, family tragedy, war, wild west, politics, standing one's ground as one of the only ones to do so - how many worthy themes can one book pack amongst it's pages in such an attractive way?  I will not actually describe the events of T.R.'s earlier life and hence, the book, in this comment, because if you are not familiar with many of the events in his life (as I was not) before reading it, you will feel very rewarded by letting the events unfold before you.  I was surprised, and grateful that T.R. was the American he was.  You will read this book and wish you were as sturdy of an American as he actually was.  Please read this book. Give yourself that gift.  A masterful life told by a master storyteller. 
 While not as detailed as a textbook might be, it covers general points very well 
 I have a degree in Geography and started recently an MBA. I searched for a book that could help me, by my self, this summer, to understand the basics of Accounting before classes. I finished reading the book just before started attending Accounting classes and I'm perfectly fit, even with the students of Economics and Management. This book is very easy to read (sometimes you even feel a bit childish...) but you get what you want - the understanding of the Accounting rules and basics. The method is very original, with big pictures, full colour, simple exercises. For me, it helped to build in Excel a simplified Balance Sheet, and the Cash Flow and Income Statement, while reading the book and making the exercises. I would definitely recommend this book. I bought The Lemonade Stand book helped by the readers opinion at Amazon. This is the first time I write a review because I need to express my gratitude to the other readers who wrote before me and make me buy this excellent book

 In this Stuart Woods' book, we find Stone Barrington in his first outing.  He is a Lt. Detective on limited duty due to a bullet he took to his knee and has decided after an evening out to walk home in order to get some exercise to it when, in a case of being in either the right place at the right time, or wrong place at the wrong time, he witnesses a woman falling from a building.  It turns out to be a rather famous TV personality who was scheduled to take her place as a co-anchor on a prestigious network the next night.  When he arrives at her apartment he hears someone leaving it rapidly, but when he gives chase his knee gives out and he loses the person he was chasing.  However, what is set up to be a relatively open-and-shut homicide case is quickly muddied by the arrival of a freelance journalist who got footage of her at the scene showing that she was still alive when put in the ambulance, by her diary that shows that she was severely depressed at times, and then by her disappearance - no body, no crime.  Barrington's obsession with finding out the truth in this case, as opposed to just finding someone to stick with the crime, quickly puts him at odds with the rest of the department (with whom he never fit in all that well to begin with) and he soon finds himself railroaded out on a medical disability retirement.  However, he has a background in law and decides to take the bar exam and set himself up that way.  The twists just keep on coming as taxi drivers start getting murdered around the city, and Barrington begins to get notes purportedly from the missing star.  I started to read these books out of order when I picked up "Reckless Abandon" and then "Two Dollar Bill," then I decided to hold off until I put my hands on all of them and start at the beginning; I'm glad I have, because I can now look forward to a long line of these most excellent thrillers.  Woods knows how to put together a great mystery and keep it exciting 
 This book may not be the most direct or blunt book about IQ, but its popularity made it instrumental in changing the signposts of what is considered legitimate discussion on the topic today.  First, to clear out a misconception. This book is not primarily about Race. It only touches on race indirectly because race is an intractible part of society and reality today. H&M (Herrnstein and Murray) bend over backwards to exclude race from their analysis when they can. When trying to show the relationship between Intelligence and Income, they first limit themselves to WHITES ONLY so that the argument of racial discrimination cannot arise. Then they appply this to welfare, education, poverty single-parenthood...just about anything of concern to society at large today.  The relationship is clear. People with high IQ succeed (on the average), low IQs have a heightened risk of pathology and welfare dependence (once again on the average).  Of course this has to be applied to the thorny problem of racial differences in average IQ as well. And thats what many of the negative reviews concentrate on. Nonetheless it is a fact that the major races differ in average IQ, and this leads them to statistically different life outcomes.  One gripe I have about the book is what H&M call their "relentlessly moderate" tone. Reality is not relentlessly moderate. By that I mean there is no such thing as "sitting on the fence" in this case. For example they seem to argue for quotas (affirmative action) in quite a few places. To say they dont is obfuscation. However I realize this is necessary to be considered a "scholorary work" in todays political and social climate.   Overall whatever your views, this book will be of interest to any honest reader. Simply because it does more to argue any position, it lays out a plethora of data on Intelligence, its origins and its impact on the modern world.   Highly Recommended 
 This cd is wonderful. It is without a doubt a classic, even though all of ushers cd's since my way are classics.  I really love this cd.  You can just put this cd on repeat and listen to it the whole way through. I've heard it a million times.  The only problem I have with it is it only has 10 songs, when it first came out, every song was soo good I was craving for more songs.  But quality, not quantity.  I can respect it!! 
 This is a remarkable document.  It is at once a manual on military strategy, on effective management of his troops, and on the psychology of the enemy.  But it is also a history, with smatterings of anthropology, sometimes our only source on a vanished pre-Roman way of life in what became France.  Finally, and most difficult to grasp, there is a political subtext, in which Caesar is communicating with both allies and rivals in Rome, advancing his career while advising future leaders on proper conduct.  Why did he mention certain things?  What did he omit?  What political image (or self-consciously enduring myth) was he creating for himself?  There are few antique documents as fascinating and to boot it is a literary masterpiece of clear exposition and rapidly moving narrative.  Once you read it - and it must be read carefully and with references to other sources - you will have no doubt that Caesar was one of the greatest leaders of all time:  afterall, his name is the basis for Tzar as well as Kaiser!  Then there are the details.  What stick out in my mind are individual tales of bravery as well as foolishness, rendered in detail as vivid as a novel, and the ever-present possibility of failure or even disaster from which Caesar always manages to pull victory at the decisive moment; of course, there are the many instances of brutality in a time of different standards of military conduct.  Then there is the siege of Alesia.  To protect his troops and starve out the enemy (and the charismatic Gaul, Vercingetorix), Caesar at Alesia had in a matter of days not only to build a surrounding rampart facing in, but also one facing outwards (14 miles in curcumference!), to ward off the last-stand of the bravest of the Gauls.  Finally, to break the spirit of small revolts after Alesia, Caesar cut off the hands of all the Bellevoci who took up arms in a desperate, last gambit that Caesar feared would repeat itself in innumerable city-tribes as his consulship ended.  It worked.  And there are many characters who figure later in the great civil wars that destroyed the last remnant of the Republic: Brutus, Labienus, Mark Antony, and Cicero's brother Quintus Tullius. You get glimpses of them as men as well as military leaders who later opposed Caesar.  As with much in Classical Civilization, the more you know the more you love it.  And the more this period of diversity looks like a metaphor, or example, for the present.  There is a good reason why the educations of scholars in the humanities (as well as in the sicneces) and diplomates began with the Classical era - read this and see how relevant it still is, in light of the War in Irak.  This is one of the most important documents from the period.    Warmly recommended.  If you are predispoosed, it will influence the way you think of contemporary events 
 Not having read any Hesse since my college days, over 20 years ago, I was expecting adolescent angst plus a little sex. But I was pleasantly surprised by the similarities of this book to Kafka's "The Castle". Layers of reality (or are they fantasy?) get peeled away only to reveal additional mysteries. Can the League's misfortunes/failures have really been only the reflection of the protagonist's own weaknesses? By the end, everything the protagonist believed has been turned upside down, except, perhaps, his faith in the continuing search, the journey East. And there's not enough didacticism about the book to turn off skeptics. It's thin, but quite lovely, really 
 I read this book for the first time back in Junior High School on the recomendation of a friend, and I have always regreted not picking it up earlier. This book will hold you captivated from the first page to the last sentence. I would recomend this book to any avid reader 
  If you're even showing an interest to vol.2 then you most likely own or have seen vol.1. Even then I recommend this one as much as any of them, since you gotta watch the whole series in order to find out what happens in the end. Anyways, vol.2 offers the same fun antics the 1st vol. did, BUT unfortunately when compared to vol.1 you'll see that there are a whole lot less sword fights and basically no violence at all. Any sword fighting that actually occur usually doesn't last long enough to be considered a "fight". But this DVD makes up for that with plenty more comical antics than the 1st vol. So enjoy it, I know I did 
 I love Rachel Ray.  Her cooking show is my favorite so I was very excited about this book.  The recipes in it are, as expected, wonderful.  Like everyone has said, an index would be nice, but that would not be enough of a fault to keep me from buying it again.  Also, I am a fan of pictures in cookbooks and this one has very few, but it is still a great buy... and if you watch the show, then maybe you'll get the visual from there.  
 This book seems to bring together all the things I've been reading and studying for the last 20 years or so. Professor de Quincey is able to put into words thoughts I've had but couldn't express.  I find that I have to be ready for a book before it has meaning.  I have bought books, had them on a shelf, and started them several times before being able to read them. That happened with Radical Nature. All at once it made sense! Radical Knowing is even better!  I need to buy more copies to loan out, because I want this one always available 
 I had been reading about this book in Oxygen magazine and had seen it other places and thought I'd give it a try.  It is awesome!  If you're looking for a way to tone your butt, this is it!  I was a little sore after doing the exercises, but it was worth it!  Give it a try!  You'll love it!  : 
 This is a fine collection for those who want a taste of "Sassy", as she was called. The mastering is phenomenal and the songs are classics 
 In my opinion, Tha Dogg Pound's 1995 album "Dogg Food" is West Coast G-Funk's greatest album. Dr. Dre may have pioneered the G-Funk genre, but Tha Dogg Pound duo of Kurupt and Daz Dillinger truly perfected it on this album. The production features some of the best g-funk has to offer, with its whiny synths, deep and slow rolling bass, female vocal hooks, and layers of smooth instrumentals. Daz and Kurupt make for good lyricists as well, establishing themselves as some of the West Coast's best. They explore such topics as drugs, the East Coast/West Coast beef, women, and the laidback lifestyle of Long Beach, California. They are often aided by Long Beach contemporaries such as Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, Mr. Malik of Illegal, Nancy Fletcher, Tray Deee, and others. Dr. Dre's "The Chronic" and Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Doggystyle" get all the glory, but "Dogg Food" is g-funk's true gem.  The first full song is the clique's anthem "Dogg Pound Gangstaz", which has a great deep beat and lyrics representing their group. "Respect" has awesome production, and the lyrics drop law philosophy. "New York, New York" contributed to the West Coast/East Coast beef, and it's a great song nonetheless, with a New York style beat and lyrics about their perception of the city. "Smooth" is my favorite song on the disc, with amazing production, verses from Daz, Kurupt, and Snoop, and an excellent chorus. "Cyco-Lik-No (B*tch Azz N**gas)" is a hard track slamming softies, and "Ridin', Slipin', and Slidin'" is an awesome laidback cut. "Let's Play House" is truly legendary, with a great R&B styling from Nate Dogg and Nancy Fletcher, and the funny lyrics to go over the great production. "I Don't Like to Dream About Getting Paid" is one of my favorites, with a hook by Nate Dogg, it's a very upbeat and happy sounding tune dealing with the struggles of jobs and the temptations of the drug trade. "Do What I Feel" and "Some Bomb Azz" are both laidback, West Coast cuts that I love hearing. "Reality" and "One By One" feature good guest appearances and production. "Sooo Much Style" ends the album on an excellent note.  "Dogg Food" is probably the best album g-funk has to offer, a complete masterpiece that perfected it. I recommend it to anyone who loves hip hop, because it is just a fun, laidback album that's great to listen to at any time 
 Along with all classic rock albums,this one along with Sabbath's first , Cooper's "Killer" Heep's first and countless of "Classics of Classics"  I have to mention that way before Zeppelin had been accredited to laying down the law for hard rock,Purple had already done it. 1967 was when Purple was together and 1970 was their year. This album clears the path for all hard rock to come ,with a little progressivism too. Blackmore and Lord truly are the gods of hard melting rock in a "Classical " framework. If you call yourself a rocker ,this album must be in your collectio 
 I just finished "Deep in the Darkness" last night.  Whenever I pick up a novel, I have such high hopes that it will be great.  I want the book to excite me as much as the little blurb on the back that got me to read it in the first place.  Unfortunately, that doesn't happen often.  That was not the case with this book.  It was a wicked great read!!!!  I almost wish I hadn't read it so fast, but it is truly a page-turner.  EXCELLENT! 
 A friend suggested that I try one of Tony Hillerman's books and COYOTE WAITS is the one that I picked up. After finishing it, I was really glad that I had listened!  This is the story of murder and mystery on a Navajo reservation located in Arizona and New Mexico (it crosses the border into both states). A Tribal Police Officer is murdered and an old shaman (medicine man) is charged with the murder. Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn (both Tribal officers) go their own ways to try and solve this case and end up crossing paths several times. Hillerman then throws in the family of the shaman who is trying to get someone to believe in his innocence. Next in the story is a young, female public defender that has just returned from Washington back to the place where she grew up and her first assignment is this case. A missing history professor in search of Butch Cassidy and a few other asundery characters are added to the mix for good measure. They all total a wide variety of personalities and ideas, which is part of the intrigue of COYOTE WAITS.  This story was very interesting and at times suspenseful. It's more of a mystery type story than a tale filled with suspense, but it is very well done. The characters are vivid and seem to be mimicked from real-life people. The reservation, customs, and Indian myths are accurate and well described. These are interwoven into a book that wets your appetite for more and Tony Hillerman has a long list from which to choose.   This book was the beginning of my journey with Hillerman, and if the others are as enjoyable, I will be very pleased. 
  Personally I just fipped through most of the "current" story the story set in the present.  I found this to be generic and not very compelling.    I found the alternate track dealing with the "forest people" to be fascinating.  It shows the development of one guy into a real leader of his people and the idea of the histories isn't too bad either.    Also I respect Dekker for brining us a book that is not released over a long period of time by releasing all the books over a 5 month period he is helping out those of us who don't read unfinished series'.  I learned my lesson reading Song of Ice and Fire.  So thank you Mr. Dekker keep them comming.    
 I really enjoyed this book. I related to many of the things that were talked about in this book. Although is is not based on factual medical basis, it does provide the insight of a PATIENT with IC and that is very important. 
 Mr. Grisham's book  puts a very personal spin on the death penalty with the interesting twist of having a lawyer turn out to be the grandson of a the murderous racist convict. The book shows to literal evil of the codemned man. I was never persuaded to change my opinon of the death penalty. I agree with it. What this book convinced me that at some point a murderer can repent but that doesnt excuse that past crime. The portrayl of the condemned man in this book is brillant. This is an excellent books that flows smoothly and quickly 
 I am a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) so I am probably biased.  Now that that is spelled out, I will write this message: "Science and Human Behavior" is an awesome and enlightening read!  Behaviorism (Behavior Analysis) is a growing field.  As more people get comfortable with the idea of a true science of human behavior, we will make strides in predicting and controlling human behavior.  In the future, the controllers or nurturers (parents, teachers, coaches, military leaders, politicians, bosses, etc.) will have an evidenced-based science of human behavior to change people in positive ways.  Effective checks can also be developed to control the new science of human behavior as B.F. Skinner recommends.  This science and knowledge sure beats the haphazard techniques politicians, bosses, etc. use to influence people to do the right behaviors in order to achieve a common goal.    Perhaps some day the nurtured (controlled) and nurturers (controllers) will work together to make the world a better place.  People surrender themselves to the controllers with employment, military service, sports team participation and so forth.   Why not study those controls scientifically?  
 I've been a fan of Samurai Champloo for a while now, so I kinda knew what to expect from the soundtrack. It's great to hear the full length songs, when on the show, you only get a 10- 15 sec. snippet. I do live sound in a Jazz club, and play the soundtrack during set breaks, and all the time people are asking me what I'm playing. If you like "chill out" or downtempo I would highly recommend it 
 I have lots of gluten free cookbooks.  So far this is my favorite!  It has yummy chocolate chip cookies, pumpkin spice bread and sandwich bread. Don't pass this one up 
 This book isn't rocket science... But it is a great way to gain some sanity and understanding when your toddler is driving you mad.  It explains why children do what they do, and that in most cases, annoying toddler behaviors are important developmental milestones and NOT just a child being 'naughty. 
 If you are reading this review, you no doubt share fond memories of the classic arcade games of the late `70s and early `80s with your fellow readers.  For some this renewed interest can be satisfied by playing a few games from the past on a console or emulators such as MAME, but for others these games and the memories with which they are intertwined become no less than a detrimental obsession.  Enter Adam Pennyman, the main character in the D.B. Weiss novel, "Lucky Wander Boy."  Adam, a moody self-absorbed copywriter and sometimes charlatan graphic-designer, has an epiphany of sorts when a colleague introduces him to the MAME emulator.  Childhood memories of a dingy arcade in Illinois and other trappings of his teenage years engulf him as he witnesses the rebirth of Frogger on a laptop screen.  While this book details the epiphany of Adam Pennyman as he rediscovers games from his past, there is much more presented to the reader than just 80's nostalgia.    D.B. Weiss delves into a study of the inexplicable and unpredictable occurrences that we all experience and looks at the paths that these events put before us.  Weiss uses non-fictional games such as Pac-Man to illustrate this study in passages such as this discussion concerning our voracious yellow friend and his penchant for the dots in the maze:  "...each dot will possess a snowflake's uniqueness, and the acquisition of each-no, the experience of each-will bring the Pac-Man a very specific and distinct joy or sorrow.  The dots all rack up points equally, of course; in retrospect, however, some are revealed as wrong choices, links in a chain of wrong choices that trace out a wrong path leading to a withering demise beneath the adorable and utterly forgiving eyes of Blinky, Inky, Pinky, or Clyde."  	The protagonist's quarry, the fictional Lucky Wander Boy arcade game, exemplifies this concept in that its rewards are earned through a random chain of events within the game.  While most games I played as a youth had a predictable set of actions and outcomes due to an obvious path towards success such as the repeatable movements in Dragon's Lair or the rudimentary artificial intelligence in Pac-Man, Lucky Wander Boy might be described as a surrealistic foray into random chaos and reward.  No particular sequence of events can be repeated that appear to lead the avatar towards reproducible success.  Rewards tend to appear through random actions of the player, but also these rewards and sights offered to the gamer will vary by individual.  Of course, in an environment of such flux, one might begin to question natural laws and make otherwise obviously illogical choices.  Weiss uses the common junction of classic arcade games in many of our memories as a starting point to show how divergent our life experiences and results truly are.  Like the pixilated hero in the Lucky Wander Boy game, our fate is left to many dimensions of chance and coincidence, our own action in the face of these events, and an infinite number of other forces at work around us.  The ensuing and seemingly random threads; events, connections, experiences, and acts lead each of us to certain, but infinitely individual endpoints.  Along these threads, we tend to have milestones of sorts that many of us share in our collective experiences that provide points of reference much like a trail of breadcrumbs.  For Adam Pennyman, his memories of the classic gaming era renewed by his experience with MAME, become defining moments that he believes mark the beginning of his wandering from childhood naiveté to adult disillusionment.  He attempts to retrace these breadcrumbs in order to find peace for himself as well as bring his arcade epiphany to life for the world to see.   James McGovern www.retroblast.com 
 This book may be lacking in lengthy discussions but it certainly gave me some needed perspective and some positive advice.  It reads like a collection of small advice columns... and though this format turned me off when I picked up the book, I soon grew to enjoy it, picking it up at odd moments.  I like the positive nature of this book, and it was one of the few I've read that doesn't entirely focus on the "problems" of step parenting 
 I love this book because it has complete, concise definitions of every literary facet you can think of. I have used it as a study tool for my certification tests, as a quick look up tool before tests, and as a way to explain difficult literary terminology to my students. I cannot stress how badly English teachers (and anyone else who loves literature) needs this book 
 I really enjoyed this book, but I can't name a specific reason why.  Part of it was the appeal of the family lake cabin and the memories I have of our family cabin, part of it was the characters and who knows what else.  At times, I felt like I was reading a true story and I definitely developed a compassion for the characters.  The only downside was that there were so many characters, that I had a hard time keeping them all straight.  Thank goodness for the family tree, as I was constantly flipping back to it 
 This is an extremely interesting book with wonderful insights of the Human development,  A must in everyone's shelves!!!  
 This book is possibly the best design education text I've seen. Everything is kept simple, and clear. Ellen Lupton's categorizing of typeface styles, for example, is logical and all inclusive, yet still a simple breakdown of the vast variety of typefaces. She is easier to understand than Robert Bringhurst in "The Elements of Typographic Style," something crucial to any budding designer. This book will serve you well 
 Jenny McCarthy is so funny! This is a must read book weather you are pregnant a new mom or have been one for years. Sometimes she's so honest it's scary but it deffintly does not freak you out about being a mom. I highly recommend this book! I've just started reading life laughs by Jenny McCarthy. 
 Oliver Stone is truly one of the greatest contemporary filmmakers of our time. That's why I look forward to reading this book 
 In the book The Great Fire the author gives you a lot of amazing facts, pictures, and he lets you see what is going through four main character's eyes.  One of the amazing facts this book gives you is that the people who told the fire engines what place to go, miscalculated it three times, and sent the fire engines in wrong directions.  One of the great pictures they give you is a lady on postcard posing as Catherine O'Leary milking the cow that started the fire.  This book is a great book for young readers like me.  I give The Great Fire by Jim Murphy two thumbs up 
 Very well built, right down to the battery compartment! This is a very sensitive receiver, with DEPENDABLE analog tuning. The LED light source is bright. The switches are logical in their placement. I own SIX of these radios. These are stored for emergency use. Think about this the next time you have a power outage at your house: A radio with a light source is not only useful for you as an adult to listen to the weather and news, it comforts children with that light! It also gives them something to do, 'learning' about radio and electricity in general. One radio for EACH child means that you will always have a working unit on hand--here redundancy counts! And GUESS WHAT! IF you break a whip antenna, ETON CARRIES REPLACEMENT PARTS that you can order right from their web site!!! Now, how many times have you seen a radio manufacturer that actually carries parts? I haven't had such parts availability since about the 1960's!  
 THE BATJAC SUSPENSE COLLECTION is truly a mixed bag of four films and may be of interest based purely on your point of view about the importance of films as mere entertainment or the development of film techniques in general.   For example RING OF FEAR seems to be solely a showcase of the Cinemascope process and the possibilities it offers. Even tough it centers around murder and mayhem in a traveling circus, the film asks you to come to the circus and in an allegorical sense asks you to come and see what Cinemascope is all about. Its sensational approach such as having Mickey Spillane in the cast playing himself hired to catch the culprit and endless scenes of circus acts strewn about add to the curiosity element of this obscure film.   MAN IN THE VAULT, a very low budget film noir entity seems like it was made to give the likes of the talented Andrew V. McLaglen an opportunity to direct his own film early in his career and also give actor William Campbell a chance to see if he had enough screen presence and charisma to become a potential leading man.   PLUNDER OF THE SUN is one of the highlights in this collection. It plays much like a movie from the film noir genre with its somber tone and cynical mood. Glenn Ford certainly typifies the film noir hero as Al Colby a disillusioned loner who becomes involved in what appears to be some shady dealings with several mysterious characters and a mysterious package from Havana to Mexico. Glenn Ford plays this character with a gritty realism. During the first third of the film Ford is seen down and out living in a world comprised of stark undercurrents. Director John Farrow however films the rest of the tale in vivid daylight once it shifts from Havana to the bright decks aboard ship en route to sunny Mexico. Yet, Farrow uses vivid light in lieu of dark shadows to create this film noir vision in broad daylight. Essentially this could have been a standard murder adventure mystery but Farrow's approach gives this film a jagged realism with imperfect and vulnerable characters.  Farrow's approach raises questions of morality. Is hero Glenn Ford really involved in stealing Mexican artifacts for his own monetary gain at the expense of Mexico's cultural and historical heritage? Ford's fatalistic approach to his character adds to the noir and mystery of this film. Sean McClory gives a brilliant and appealing performance as Jefferson, an enigmatic scoundrel with a bleach blonde crew cut to boot that tries to steal Ford's secret parcel throughout the film. Diana Lynn also gives a very credible performance as a woman of dubious character exuding unrefined sensuality that also vies for Ford's parcel. Jonathan Latimer's script, based on the novel by David Dodge, and director Farrow's vision greatly realized by Jack Draper's brilliant cinematography lends to the notion that the characters are dealing with something of greater importance than all their efforts to outmaneuver each other. Composer Antonio Diaz Conde's score is colorful capturing the flavor of the Mexican locale and wonderfully compliments the idea that the plundering the historical treasures may certainly be sacrilegious and detrimental to those who attempt such transgressions. This film is certainly a lost gem exemplifying the cohesive art of solid filmmaking.  TRACK OF THE CAT is the gem in this collection. TRACK OF THE CAT is an obscure yet brilliant allegorical tale of a snowbound family whose distorted views on patrimony and perceived lascivious behavior, all shaped by the conniving matriarchal Beulah Bondi, come to a resounding climax after being set into motion by the perceived appearance of a mountain lion. Directed by William "Wild Bill" Wellman the word "perceived" literally describes the haunting images and ambiguous and double-edged dialogue that unfolds. The "perceived" threat of the mountain lion tests the family's understanding for their environment. They can irrationally fear its unknown dangers, be oblivious to its true dangers or live in it with sensible harmony and practical respect for all the wonders it holds. Brothers Robert Mitchum and William Hopper pursue the unseen cat across treacherous snow covered mountainous terrain. Wellman filmed these scenes on location on Mount Rainier. Waiting in the cabin for their return are Tab Hunter (their younger brother), Teresa Wright (their sister), Diana Lynn (in pursuit of Hunter's love) and their parents (Philip Tonge and Bondi). Filmed in WarnerColor director Wellman had cinematographer William H. Clothier essentially film the images in a bleached out and colorless "black & white" effect where everything is shot against a white background. The exteriors of blinding white snow are counterbalanced by the interiors of the cabin whose walls and ceiling are painted bleach white. In contrast, the trees, horses, furniture and actors (all dressed in dark and/or white attire) all appear black against Clothier's white cinematic canvas. The effect is unsettling, unnerving and unforgettable if you have ever seen this film. The result is that of a nightmarish and haunting tale that eludes the viewer's sense of morality in a superficial and dreamlike world of black and white where black and white are constantly being juxtaposed redefining what is apparent just for the moment. Roy Webb's excellent stereo score accentuates the unnerving fear in very stark chords like blinding sunlight glistening off snow-covered slopes. I also found Tab Hunter's commentary on the film very insightful, making TRACK OF THE CAT much worth having in my collection.  It is a very economical decision to purchase THE BATJAC SUSPENSE COLLECTION if you are truly interested in TRACK OF THE CAT and PLUNDER OF THE SUN. The extras on these two discs are invaluable and you will end up with four films at the same time.   
  If you really want to try out some new stuff or tweak things in your sex life/relationship, here's the ticket!  This is a great tool box of fun ideas and playful lovingness.  Got something you wanna talk about but don't know how to?  Here you go!  Wanna lighten up about sex already?  Gotcha covered.  And the illustrations are a hoot!  I laughed out loud, I got some great new ideas.  What a wonderful sexy time.  I totally loved this book!  Humor and sweetness -- what a treat 
 I was pleased with the quality of this book.  I passed the PMP exam on my first testing, using only this book to supplement my own professional experience.  The book was straightforward on the topics, and highlighted special items needed for the exam.  The review questions at the end of each chapter were very helpful.  Although they now have changed the exam, this was a very good book and should be considered for the next edition to match the new PMP exam 
 Basically just another amazing album from Sigur Ros. I can understand how some people dislike the music because it really does take a little patience to get into. The songs are slow and long, so if your in a hurry you might as well pass on this music. With that said, there's some incredibly beautiful music to be heard on this disc and I wouldn't recommend passing it up. Highlights are "Svefn g englar", "Staralfur", "Flugufrelsarinn", "Vidrar vel til loftarasa" & "Olsen olsen 
 This chilling book is the real-life Oliver Twist exposed.I think Fredrick Engels wrote this book,in part to clear his conscious.And largely, to shed light on the fetid ,wretched underbelly of the 19th century industrial-age society.The nameless toilers working ten to twelve hour shifts,in a factory operation they had no vote or control over.Marx and Engels had many valid arguments for improving the workers lives.Did their end-results justify their means of social revolution? Engels would be amazed at the former textile towns,like Manchester,absorbing the large influx of Asians,Moslims and Africans today.It is still being debated,whether history has proven Engels & Marx right.This book is still a historical classic,thats presumptive findings give the modern reader,reason to pause. So,look all around you. -A Great Book !    
 I bought "Learning SQL" in order to begin to prepare myself for the Microsoft Certification Exam for SQL Server 2005. I had some prior knowledge of SQL, but almost exclusively in writing SELECT statements. "Learning SQL" broadened my knowledge with its simple, easy to follow chapters. All of the important concepts are explained, and the examples given are very clear and intuitive.  The best part about this book is that it also introduced me to MySQL. The command-line interface was at first daunting, but then focused me on the code and syntax and nothing else. The sample code available for free online also provides an excellent companion for this book, as the hands-on approach is undoubtedly the best way to cement the concepts. The exercises at the end of the chapters gave me confidence and assurance.  Overall, "Learning SQL" is a terrific book for people looking to bridge the gap to understanding SQL beyond clumsy SELECT statements to a much more comprehensive knowledge 
 He leído varios libros de autores españoles recientemente. Y La Reina del Sur y La Sombra del Viento, sobresalen por la mezcla de creatividad literaria y entretenimiento que muchos lectores buscan y que los autores han sabido magistralmente imprimir en sendas obras. Si lo que quiere es un libro de aventuras bien planeadas, en locales exóticos y comunes, con una exquisita visión literaria que no sacrifica en nada la continuidad de la lectura, con pasajes cinematográficos difícil de olvidar en el idioma español, La Reina del Sur es, por mucho, ejemplo de la literatura que sin dejar de serlo, atrae a quienes gustan de la ficción popular. Un logro extraordinario por un autor consagrado.  
 'Angel in the Whirlwind' is an engaging and informative account of the American Revolution. Instead of just going through the war, this book gives you an interesting look into colonial society around the time of the revolution, allowing you to understand the mindset of our colonial ancestors as they set off 'into the whirlwind'. The book's coverage of the battles, both military and political, are extensive, and I especially enjoyed the section on the War in the South, which a lot of accounts on the revolution don't elaborate on. This book is a wonderful account of the war, bringing in all the major players and the events they orchestrated, allowing the revolution to be better understood. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the war and the politics behind it 
 This little book has some good bits of wisdom in it, but it is also couched in 1950's family roles... expecting the woman to be the house maker and the man is the bread winner... it is a dated concept of personal roles 
 Blue Stone's ethereal paradise is sensual and spiritual with vocal labyrinths in which to wander like a mist seeping through stillness. This is music in which to lose yourself and every stress you imagined you had before you put on your headphones. The heights and the depths of this album are all completely satisfying. If you love Delerium, Sleepthief or Evening Ocean, I think you will sink into this album, turn up the volume and dissolve into the sensation of sound. Breathe is magical and sexy with sensual whispery lyrics rich with lush gothic and world music appeal.   ~The Rebecca Review  
 Playful, cheery pictures accompany this search for a green sheep. Quirky sheep in rountine and outlandish situations help the young reader identify colors and understand comparisons. The rhyming search ends with a peek at the missing sheep. The repetitive phrase "where is the green sheep?" will have young readers quickly chiming in. A clever book that will work as a beginning reader as well as a read-aloud 
  The Bayou, Louisiana.  This documentary is shot with a beautiful black & white photography. The music perfectly matches the tempo and feeling of the story. Lasts only 75 minutes but captures our emotion and interest right from the first scene.   The box of the dvd misleads. It made me expect some kind of social reportage on the impact of oil industry in the pristine  bayou wildlife. On the contrary (but that's for you to check).  The story is basically the life of a young and enchanting kid in the Bayou. His daily occupations, his relation with surrounding nature (its enchants and perils). It provokes an emotion similar to the reading of Huckelberry's adventures.   Again, as in all of Mr. Flaherty's documentaries, it's the sheer beauty of the photography and the wonderful capture of the expression of people's faces, real people, that make the viewing a humanly enriching experience.  I have to recommend, also of Mr. Flaherty, "The Man of Aran" and "Nanook of the North".  
 This is a great story.  I will follow the story in future books.  The characters are very real and are easy to merge with for a fun ride.  Chas E. Mose 
 It's no coincidence that the opening epigraph of Lewis' one and only novel is from Shakespeare's _Measure for Measure_.  Both works have pillars of public moral rectitude collapsing after encountering their first major temptation of carnality.  Monk Ambrosio figures in for a penny, in for a pound, and starts the slide from mere sex to murder, incest, despair, and damnation.  Lewis' streamlined prose abandons the detailed descriptions of Gothic architecture and Alpine vistas favored by his model Ann Radcliffe.  And, in a plot of not two but four frustrated lovers, he crams many a gruesome incident and image.  No Radcliffean rationalism for Lewis.  Despite frequent criticms of the  superstition of Spain during the Inquistion, this plot revels in the supernatural with curses, ghosts, Bleeding Nuns, Wandering Jews, and the Prince of Demons himself.  Yet, despite the melodrama, there is an air of psychological realism in how Monk Ambrosio rationalizes his escalation of evil.  Perhaps more disturbing is the mind of Matilda, his first lover, and her willingness to advise and aid his evil even after he has sexually spurned him.  Stephen King's introduction is, like many such introductions to classic works, an unfortunate spoiler of much of the plot.  However, most of his observations are valid and interesting though I'm dubious that all English novels before Horace Walpole's _The Castle of Otranto_ had moral purposes.  (Lewis novel seems to have no serious moral statement except, perhaps, that the chaste life of the convent and monastery is unnatural.)  Oxford University Press seems to have taken the typesetting of this edition from an earlier one.  A lot of asterisks show up in the text without accompanying footnotes.  A minor annoyance  to a novel that holds up well after more than 200 years 
 I was a little wary of reading this book since she was never able to get it published during her lifetime despite trying for many years. I assumed that if she couldn't get it published that it probably wasn't very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this book. It is meant to be a satirical work mocking the Gothic romance popular during Jane Austin's lifetime. In such romances, there were fictional monsters and secret corridors and such, and in this book the main character, Catherine, keeps thinking that such things were going to pop up or had popped up, but they never really had. Towards the end, instead of some fantastic mythical monster, a real monster emerges as the culprit behing the pain Catherine experiences: pride in rank.  The father of Henry Tilney, whom Catherine has fallen in love with, refuses to allow them to be married because Catherine is of a lower rank and has less money that his family does.  Austin vilifies the wealth heriarchy of her day through both Henry's father and through her friend Isabella who tries to do anything that she can to marry someone wealthier than herself, leading Catherine to much pain.  This is nowhere near as good as some of Miss Austin's other works, but it is good nontheless, and a fun read. It's much better if you understand what Gothic romance novels were like, since this is a satire on those novels.  Overall grade: B 
 I am very happy with this book.  It has given me food for thought about where I would like to take my desire for lifelong learning 
 This book was assigned in a graduate-level research methods class in geography. I generallly do not hold much hope for writer's "manuals," but Trimble's slim volume is so much more.  His own  writing is clear, honest, and pithy.  I make all of my senior research  students read it now, as a professor, and it's by far the best small  treatise on the subject.  It could be used side-by-side with  Strunk&White's Elements of Style seamlessly.  Get it 
 Richard Olney probably came closer to perfection as a cookbook author than any other American.  His books are exquisite models of focus, structure, warmth, and practicality, and his treatment of food and wine somehow manages to be simultaneously perfectly balanced and highly personal.  Next to Olney's cookbooks and vinyard monographs, the oevres of James Beard and Julia Child, for example, feel overblown, oversold, and downright sloppy.  Olney's warmhearted incision is the perfect match for the home cooking of Lulu Peyraud.  Mm Peyraud is the Marseille native, mother of seven, keystone of the Bandol food and wine community, renowned home cook, and owner-operator of Domaine Tempier, widely considered the finest vinyard of France's Mediterranean coast.  Most famously, she is gratefully credited by Alice Waters, Kermit Lynch, Jeremiah Tower, Paul Bertolli, and a host of other American food heirarchs with being their inspiration and touchstone.  But for years before America found the simple pleasures of expertly-prepared, highly-local, regional foods, Lulu and Richard were cooking lunches for each other under their respective grape arbors.  This book is a broad sample of those meals.  In it, Olney documents the preparation, from farm and fish-market to plate, of Mm Peyraud's favorite family meals.  Each recipe is presented with notes on ingredients, irregularities and seasonal adjustments in Mm Peyraud's preparations, lucid explanations of techniques, and reminders to keep things loose.  The result is a highly-informative glimpse into the regional cuisine that forms the culinary hunge between France and Piedmont-Liguria.  This cuisine is one of the world's most satisfying, and I believe that this book is its greatest Testament.  I won't single out any recipes this time.  The book is full of stunners from salad to desert.  Buy this book and a couple of bottles of Domaine Tempier [a rose and a red, for starters], and serve those wines, chilled Provence-style, with a sampling of these magical dishes.  Serve them, if at all possible, under a grape arbor on a hot, sunny day in an ocean breeze.  And raise a glass to Lulu and Richard for their generous hospitality 
 I had heard a bunch of people talking about this book so I bought it as an impulse buy. When I got home and started going through it, I was a bit disappointed as it didn't have any sweaters patterns or other patterns that you normally see in other knitting books! That's when I got it. This stuff was all brand new and a fresh way of looking at things! More importantly, it was fun and made for both newer knitters and knitters that wanted a fresh perspective!   I love this book. I love the washclothes, the curtain, the night gown, the towels. I love it all. I love the log cabin blankets (however, I haven't made one yet.) This book is a phenomenon. If you're interested in a fun, interesting knitting book that actually has something you will definitely make out of it -- this is the book for you 
 It's not often that I can't put a book down and this one was one of them.  Howard's story of Annie's life was something I just couldn't put down.  You'll share the highs and lows of his life and times with Annie.  I know she's gone but I feel that I knew her.  I'm an owner of a German Sheperd which is roughly the exact opposite of a Corgi but that doesn't mean anything.  A dog is a dog is a dog.  I can see similarities between Annie and my Cali.  Part two of the book deals with the purchae and training of a dog and it's as well written as the part about Annie.  I would happily recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs or wants to love dogs 
 This commentary on Ephesians is a mainstay in my research on this letter by Paul.  I am reading and researching Ephesians for the purpose of writing my own commentary for eventual use in a sermon series, and use this book as well as others as a check on my own exegesis.  It is highly readable, very insightful, and contains enough detail without being overly simplistic on one hand and overly academic on the other.  This was one of the first commentaries I picked up and just read, and found that it read well, unlike some commentaries that are great reference books but just plain hard to read.  O'Brien rigorously defends Pauline authorship of Ephesians, and falls squarely within the conservative evangelical camp.  The book is technical, with solid exegesis and transliteration of Greek words in the body text with actual Greek in the notes.  I would highly recommend this book on Ephesians along with Hoehner and Stott and Bruce.  If you can only get one commentary on Ephesians, O'Brien is a good balance of technical and pastoral insight.  
 I'm 34 years old, and I have been using skin care products since I was 16 ranging from Lancome, Clinique, Guinot and Estee Lauder. I've always been searching for that one "perfect" day moisturizer with SPF, which is so important for protecting your skin from sun damage. I discovered Olay Regenerist one month ago and am very happy with my purchases of the Regenerating Serum, the Enhancing Lotion and the Perfecting Cream. They compliment eachother so well and make my skin radiant and smooth.  I use the Enhancing Lotion every day over the Daily Regenerating Serum and feel confident I'm doing something right for my skin. One word of caution: let it absorb into your skin before you put on your foundation or you might get white patches in certain areas. 
 WHEN AND WHERE I ENTER by Paula Giddings is one of those wonderful books that tells the real history.  WHEN AND WHERE I ENTER tells the how and the why of past events and how black women's contributions to America have made this country what it is today. This is not just black women's history, this is American history.  A must read for everyone 
 I was not familiar with Thomas Friedman's New York Times columns.  This book contains a sampling of his columns.  The book mainly portrays the difference in the Arab vs. the culture of the West. The book opens with the shock of the events of 9/11, considered a tragedy by the West and a cause for celebration for many places in the Arab and Muslim world.   The author goes onto explain the Arab world's rage against America is the result of the idea that America represents, globalization , modernity, plurality.  Muslim populations in the middle east are generally ruled by oppressive regimes that are failing their populace, providing a limited world vision, while censoring information.  The author made an interesting observation, India has the second largest Muslim population of any  country in the world,  but the Muslim rage in not present, as the author notes, chanting "death to America" is not the favored occupation of its populace.  The reason,  India is a democracy,  the people are concerned with bettering themselves  through government. And so it goes,  The author's main point is that when the Middle East can be democratized, and the poverty alleviated it will be ready to join the modern world. I really believe Tom Freidman is right on target with the ideas within this book. 
 I love this book! It has been great for teaching me to do all kinds of things I didn't know how to do. I have been stencilling for about eight years now, and my stencils looked pretty good, but her ideas makes my  stencilling look GREAT! I have many books on how to paint everything you  can name in a home. You name it and I have the book on it, but this is the  first book that I thought was worth the money I spent on it. I wish I had  bought this book eight years ago. I now have no fear in doing a full wall  mural in my living room. This book is a have to have if you are into  stencilling, or if you would like to start stencilling for the first time.  GET IT 
 Included is an In-Depth 20 page booklet with pictures of the actors and descriptions of the song environments. I will not argue the virtues of the original play vs. the movie as I grew up on the movie. However I have seen a local version of the play. This recording gives you the feel that you are there. Many people appreciate the added songs because they paint a more in-depth story especially the added tracts. However I just like the music for its own sake. I am not going to go through the list of songs or singers as I thing you will enjoy discovering them your self.  All I can say id even if you have other versions of the score you need to add this to your repertoire 
 This book was very inspiring. It is a very quick read because all of the biography is concise and to the point. Some of the people I had never heard of before and that made it all the more interesting. I don't know whether I would have called it the greatest business stories of all time or not but they certainly are up among the best. Every story was great and very interesting telling how they started and where they finished up. Also how people borrowed huge sums of money in order to buy a business that wasn't making money at the time only to turn them around. Like the guys at Harley for example putting together $1 million of their own and then borrowing $81 million to buy the company. Unbelievable.  Everyone who reads this will enjoy it as it was written very well. You will learn some valuable business and marketing concepts from the leaders of industry. Anyone will enjoy this one especially if you don't have the time to read a long biography. This is a great place for someone to start if they haven't been much of a reader of biographies because this is full of true life people overcoming against the odds 
 While this is not the best of JAK's Harmony books -- the flower-named novels in the beginning were more intriguing, with their psi energy battles -- it is nevertheless a worthy addition to her earlier work.  I find Harmony to be an absolutely fascinating place (and I particularly liked Rose, the guard dust bunny) and only wish that JAK would produce books in this series more frequently.  As usual, the characters and plotting are excellent, and I hope JAK returns to Harmony very soon. 
 I found The Ultimate Guide to Strap on Sex to be the most thorough and informative book regarding strap on sex. It left nothing to the imagination and  detailed everything I could have possibly needed answere 
 During the early part of the nineteenth century, women began to experience their first taste of autonomy.  Although women were finding a role in the American workplace and society there were not many options for them.  As part of the struggle to escape poverty in New York City, prostitution became an increasingly viable choice for girls with out other alternatives. Historian Christine Stansell states, "It was both an economic and a social option, a means of self-support and a way to bargain with men in a situation where a living wage was hard to come by, and holding one's own in heterosexual relations was difficult." This book deals with women in the factories as well as the working girls. Easy to read and very informative 
 In watching the first season of this hit show all at once (over a several night viewing), one can see why it was so popular for four seasons.  It has elements of THE FUGITIVE, X-FILES and a charming lead in the presence of Michael T. Weiss as the enigmatic Jarod.  Weiss is very good in conveying the many different emotions required, but he is at his best when he is the exuberant little boy who is discovering all the things he missed in his secluded childhood. The formula for each episode is fairly consistent:  Jarod takes on a role to find out the truth behind mysterious deaths; he finds the culprit and brings them to justice in the manner in which their victims suffered.  All along, he's trying to find who he is and what happened to his parents and being pursued by the Centre, from which he escaped is being pursued by the gentlemanly Syndey; the over the top Miss Parker, the geeky Broots and the sinister Mr. Raines.  Andrea Parker, trying to combine all the characteristics of Emma Peel, Cruela DeVil and Bullwinkle's Natasha, is so lousy an actress you start to enjoy her campy performance.  Patrick Bauchau is a fine Syndey and Jon Gries is funny as Broots.  It's Weiss' show though and it's his sincere performance that makes it all worthwhile 
 This is the MIT Press' 1987 one-volume critical edition of "George" Santayana's autobiography. It includes much material not found in Scribner's original, 1940s, three-volume publication.   This RICHLY AND PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED MIT Press edition is THE ONE TO HAVE.   Although a major figure in American philosophy, writer of one of the finest novels set in America (The Last Puritan) and an aknowledged master of English prose, Jorge Ruz de Santayana (1863-1952) was born in vila, Spain, of Spanish parents and retained his Spanish nationality until his dying day, never becoming an American citizen.  He wound up in Boston because his mother's first husband, the captain of a yankee clipper, was a Sturgis from Cod city. They met and married in the Philippines, then a Spanish colony.  After this brief  marriage, which produced 3 Sturgis children, including the only person Santayana ever truly loved, his half-sister Susana Sturgis, the widowed Mrs Sturgis married Santayana's father, an elderly Spanish colonial official. They soon separated and at age 6 little Jorge, who could hardly be brought up in vila by his old father alone, was sent to his mother, who had taken up residence in Boston with her first husband's well-off relatives.   While outwardly a successful migr student, Santayana nursed deep anger against his mother (her portrait in these mmoires is devastating) and never forgave the slight done to his father, whose austere Castilian livelihood had not been able to compete with those Yankee greenbacks.   Santayana studied at Harvard and in Germany and was aknowledged to be so brilliant he was offered a teaching post at Harvard when hardly out of graduate school. But the powers-that-be there never liked him, or he them.  His haughty, very "foreign" outward appeareance, all dressed in black like a Castilian; his cold sardonic humour; his atheism; his paradoxical love for the Catholic esthetic; his political conservatism; his homosexuality: all these were inimical to the worthy Brahmins who ran the University.  On his side, he despised their sentimental, smug progressivism; their senseless liberal religiosity; their childish moral earnesteness--all concealing a brutal sense of entitlement and power.  Santayana's successive promotions to eventual full-professorship were systematically delayed, notwithstanding his being one of the most celebrated members of the faculty. Once the crown was conferred upon him, though, he threw it in their faces, resigning his professorship in 1912. The proud Eternal Outsider moved to Europe (England, Spain, Italy) were he lived the remaining 40 years of his life.  He never set foot in the US again.  This autobiography is one of the most fascinating such documents ever created. All people depicted are unforgettably etched in acid, with a calm Pascalian insight into their souls that is almost terrifying. Santayana was a profound skeptic of human sentiments, an austere, stoic Spanish Epicurean writing the richest Emersonian English. A thousand times more percipient than Tocqueville, Santayana's point of view, the magisterial clarity with which it is propounded, are indeed uniquely prepossessing: here was the last philosopher of antiquity, mysteriously issued forth from medieval vila to address, in English, the corny foibles of the American century...in lucid Lucretian periods.    One can scarcely conceive of another book quite like this.    
 Very good collection of fresh new voices who have vast amount of talent. I didn't know what to expect when purchased, but each track is well done 
 I gave this as a gift and she made a dish from the book - the food was great.  The cookbook also has great pictures and a good selection of recipes.  I am going to buy this for myself 
 A few times a year, you find one of those albums you just can't wait to play for your friends because it is SO good.  This is one of those albums.  It reminds me most of the Pixies circa Surfer Rosa or Doolittle -- not because it sounds just like those (though similar at many points), but because of a wide-open all-over-the-place sort of sound.  It will remind you of many bands at different points -- Pixies, Hives, Mission of Burma, Modest Mouse, Jesus and Mary Chain, Cake, Franz Ferdinand,etc. -- but the sound is not so much derivative as varied.  Every song sounds different, and all are great.  This mixes a few tracks from the first two EPs + a number of new ones.  In a word - great!  This will be a hard one to top, but I am already up for the next one from this very clever band.  The most unusual thing about this is that it is the self-proclaimed first DVD album.  So you get 14 videos, but with embedded sound tracks so that you can transfer to iPod or CD if you want just music.  But the videos are great too ... lots of interesting stuff here.  Amazon, if you read these, PLEASE cross-list to the music listing.  It looks like people have bought the EPs because they couldn't find the DVD album under music, and I'd hate for anyone to miss it 
 In the world of rap, they came from the underground and made their mark. Simply one of the BEST true Hip Hop albums ever made. Simple, sustained beats with gritty bass lines and hard core rap, every joint on this CD is a classic. Hold it Down and Real Hip Hop are two underrated classics of Hip Hop culture. Take the Missy Elliots and E-40's of the world and deposit them in the trash. They couldn't hold das Efx's jock straps. No diggedy! No doubt 
 Description from the back of the book:  In the early 1820's, horse racing was a down and dirty sport.  James Wyndham, who owns racing stables in both England and America, finds his racing nemesis in red-haired Jessie Warfield, renowned hoyden and champion jockey, who knows as many dirty racing tricks as James does.  When either wins a race, the other's nose gets rubbed in the dirt.  Jessie has known James for six years, since she was fourteen years old. She often wants to kick him for the way he treats her, but more importantly, she adores him. She just doesn't know how to show it.  When chance throws Jessie out of a tree, finding her on top of James, she is pronounced Ruined.  When she decides to run, she really goes for it, all the way to England, to James's cousins, Marcus and Duchess Wyndham.  James arrives, laden with guilt, to find a Jessie who sounds like the old Jessie but isn't.  Jessie has undergone a transformation worthy of Pygmalion.  Will James do the Right Thing and undo Jessie's Ruin? What about Jessie's nightmares that seem to call up something terrible from her childhood?  There's a treasure to be found on the Outer Banks, a mystery to be solved, a love story that will plant a smile on your mouth for a long time, and lots of laughter.   * This is the 3rd & final book in the legacy series.  This was probably my 2nd favorite.  I didn't enjoy the treasure in this book.  I didn't care for the scene that played out when the treasure was found.  I predicted the villain very easily & the cow brains beside Jessie's head grossed me out when they had their first intimate moment.  Other then those things the books was good & kept me going but I wouldn't call this story great.  Overall I'd say that I'd probably read this series again but I could truly take it or leave it.  It's not a series that will stick with you the next book you read 
 This book is , like, cool.  There is a lot of words that really speak to me, man.  yea 
 The goal of Dr. Barnard is to steer everyone toward a vegan diet.  If that is not your intention, best not to pick up this book.  The changes are far-reaching, and radically different than the SAD (Standard American Diet).  I tried being a lacto-ovo vegetarian off and on throughout my life.  The thought of giving up cheese was just too much to imagine.  Additionally, having a husband whose first words about a meal were "where's the meat" made vegetarian life difficult.  But if you experience a health crisis (cancer, high cholesterol, high blood pressure) it is amazing how quickly you can moderate your behavior.  My husband and I have been vegan for approximately 5 weeks now.  We have never felt better in our lives.  If you are holding on to meat, cheese and milk but don't feel good, this book will improve your health.  Dr. Barnard also explains why it is so difficult to give up sugar, chocolate, cheese and meat.  Apparently these items contain various addicting compounds.  If someone had tried to tell me this 6 months ago I would have thought they were crazy.   Now that I have adopted a vegan lifestyle I can say that my health has improved so much is such a short period of time that it is almost miraculous.  Also, it is important to note that after 2 weeks my cravings for sugar, chocolate, cheese and meat are all but gone.  In the last 5 weeks my husband and I have seen dramatic improvements in our health.  We have both each lost 12 pounds without being hungry or exercising more.  My husband has decreased his total cholesterol from 177 to 113 (this happened in 24 days).  He has been taken off this high blood pressure medication.  I have not had a sinus headache in 5 weeks.  Prior to becoming a vegan I had chronic sinusitis.  My skin has a youthful glow (amazing for 43 year old woman).  I also sleep better at night, and wake up more well rested.  If you don't feel as good as you did in your 20's and are willing to make a radical lifestyle change, I believe that this book will improve your health.  I have also reviewed other books that advocate a vegan lifestyle if you are interested.  Check out "Eat to Live" and "Stop the Inflammation Now".  I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to improve their health.  Try it for a month; what do you have to lose?  It is a small investment in time and money that could result in a dramatic improvement in the quality of your life.  Update:  4 August 2006  My husband and I are still following a mostly vegan (95%) lifestyle.  It is amazing how simple it is once you decide it is just the way that you are going to live.  We both continue to feel fabulous.  My husband, at 52, is back to the weight he was when he graduated high school.  He is even considering beginning to exercise.  We have both lost over 20 pounds in a little under 4 months.  I continue to highly recommend this book if you are looking to make a lifestyle change for health reasons 
 Other than the Bible, this book has had the greatest influence upon my life!  I began reading Brother Lawrence's book about twenty years ago and was thrilled to find this version ten years later which combines his experience with that of Frank Laubach's. This simple but profound message of being God's friend has taken years to sink into my heart but has become more precious with each passing year. If you are hungry to know God more intimately, this is the book for you 
 Lynne Hinton's The Things I Know Best is set in North Carolina, where a home which has housed generations of the Ivy women is affected by a special gift which sparks changes and tragedy. A twin sister's experiences and predictions spark conflict and love 
 This was a great book that I had a hard time putting down. I bought this book while waiting in a airport for a flight, based on the cover mostly. Lucky guess on my part! Now I'm going to get his first two books and check them out 
 Irigaray's `rewriting' of philosophy and philosophers is essential reading for anyone interested in philosophy these days.  It is also a refreshing breath of thought on `Feminism'.  The concept of `Place'is presented as  Woman, a return to the primordial feminine via `deconstruction' (in the  best possible way) of western patriarchial hegemony.  Besides the radical  content, it is is beautifully written - clear and profound. Read this  book 
 International Master Jeremy Silman has done it again.After his epic middlegame works dedicated to the amateur player (Reassess your Chess;Reassess your Chess Workbook and The Amateur Mind)he has written the ultimate endgame manual from beginner to Master strength.His original concept is outstandingly useful to improve your chess endgame skills according to your rating. The book is abundant in typical maneuvers wonderfully explained, master tips and even entertaining historical information.Nobody from beginner to Master could be disppointed with this magnificent book masterfully designed by his author to give a powerful thrust of enhancement to most players' endgame knowledge and proficiency.

 By 1960, Ornette Coleman had already stirred an enormous controversy in the jazz world-- his first three albums on Atlantic (two early recordings on Contemporary failed to garner much attention) and tenure at Manhattan's Five Spot club had polarized musicians, critics, and listeners.  And yet, over forty years later, it's clear that Coleman was onto something, and his influence can be felt throughout music afterwards, whether acknowledged by the musician or not, whether accepted and adopted or rejected.  After 1960, Coleman rejected most of the expectations for a musician-- playing clubs, touring, album after album, mellowing with age, regurgitation of old songs, etc.  Indeed, throughout the years he has continued to stir the pot, if a bit more gently than he did when he first reached New York.  But nothing he has done has created such an enormous polarizing effect as this record, "Free Jazz".  Conceptually, the idea is a retread on the collective improvisations of the swing era-- the piece features several motifs, separated by lengthy improvisations, during which other members of the band were encouraged to offer counterpoint, melodic invention, echo, whatever.  To increase the possibility of interaction, his then working quartet (Coleman on alto, Don Cherry on trumpet, Charlie Haden on bass and Ed Blackwell on drums) were augmented by a second quartet of Eric Dolphy (performing on bass clarinet), Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Scott LaFaro (soon to replace Haden in Coleman's working band) on bass, and Coleman's former drummer Billy Higgins.  So now you know the concept, the question is how does it work?  It depends, largely on your point of view.  Certainly the music is engaging, intriguing, and fills your ears with quite a bit to listen to.  The responsiveness of the playing works better at some times than it does during others-- Dolphy and Cherry both seem to do the best responding to other soloists and inspire the best responses to their soloing.  Certainly everyone's playing is filled with an ecstatic spirit that maintains the excitement of the piece.  And I personally find the recording far superior to all works of collective "free" improvisation that it inspired (Coltrane's "Ascension", Ayler's "New York Ear & Eye Control", etc.).  There's also a bunch of points made by other reviewers that should be reiterated.  This isn't chaos, the music is organzied, but again just not in the way anything previous to it was.  Also, and perhaps more importantly, this is not for everyone.  It's not "difficult" per se, anymore than any of the other free jazz stuff is (although it is moreso than most of Coleman's other works), but it IS a 40 minute sustained performance, and certainly that alone is unusual to hear.  It's also in an idiom outside of conventional listening-- if you're not familiar with Coleman, pick up "The Shape of Jazz to Come" and see what you make of that before this one, it's more likely to inspire a positive reaction, and if you're not familiar with jazz, this is probably not the place to start (I know folks who did pick this up first).  Finally and most importantly, don't think too much about what this is supposed to be and what it's not supposed to be, enjoy it for what it is.  Personally, I find it one of the most consistently interesting and rewarding records Coleman did during his tenure with Atlantic, and the concepts on here informed his music for years to come (Prime Time in particular is very much an electric version of this record).  This CD adds the bonus of the rehearsal for the piece-- it's significantly briefer (under twenty minutes), but no less interesting.  For the adventerous and the fan of avant-garde jazz, this is an essential recording.  Highly recommended 
 I think that this one one of the most informative street racing videos I have ever seen.  And let me tell you, if I had a penny for every street racing movie I've watched, I would be a rich woman by now.  To all you who are considering buying it, spring for it, you will definatley be happy with it.  This is an awesome movie that everyone will enjoy.  Fine family fun!  (by the way, its only 11 bucks, so even if you didn't like it you wouldn't be wasting that much money, and Christmas is coming up so you can give it to your dad or your mom if you hate it. 
 Don't let the title put you off.  This book covers all sorts of  'adversity' from night flying to bird strikes to mountain flying to IMC.   It gives excellent practical advice for pilots, is easily readable, and  thought provoking.  One of the best aviation books I've read 
 I found this quote most interesting about the movie:  "Oliver Stone, as in JFK, takes certain liberties with Nixon's story and acknowledges as much in a disclaimer before the story begins. Even those who believe President Kennedy was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, for example, would find it hard to believe that Richard Nixon was involved, even tacitly, in the plot to kill JFK. Stone also takes liberties with his portrayal of Richard and Pat Nixon's marital relationship. Even though some incidents are no doubt true, it's pretty clear that some scenes between the two are conjecture on Stone's part."  Hopkins as Nixon sweats his way all the way through this one.  What a corrupt and dishonest administration Stone lets us see first hand.  It's scary how corrupt an admistration can be.   It just kept getting worse and worse for RMN.  The worse it got, the more it appears he tried to lie to get himself out of things.  It was interesting to see Haldeman and Erlichman and how they were portrayed as team players, quickly demonizing John Dean when they found out he was an independent thinker.  Nixon tried to intimidate Dean with his power, but in the end it didn't work.  Politics can be very dirty, and it makes one sad that politics cannot be more clean and honest and most importantly, straight-forward with the American people.    It was also interesting to see how horrible Nixon's marriage was and how obsessed he was with politics while ignoring his family.  
 I highly recommend this book for anyone managing a motorcycle, powersports, marine or even bicycle dealership.  It's also helpful for any small retail business.  A lot of the time retailers and dealerships mess up on the little things.  Things like how listen to the customer.  You have to learn what to react to from the customer and when not to say too much.  The book tells you how to read people.  It helps you understand how to create a good relationship that keeps the customer coming back to the dealership for new helmets, jackets, pipes and other add-ons.  MYOB2 is perfect for dealer principals.  Maybe the biggest benefit will be for dealership staff, such as service managers, parts managers and general managers looking for career advancement -- maybe even hoping to own a dealership some day.  
 This book continues the story nicely. By now the Kingpriest has been in power for 20 years, and is bent on eradicating all evil from Krynn. The Kingpriest makes the wizards of Krynn his next target, and means to destroy or capture all the towers of sorcery. Again, the Kingpriest and Cathan grow as characters, although in different directions, as the plot unfolds.   There's a lot of foreshadowing, and since I've forgotten much of the other DL books my suspense is building to see how things will play out!  One thing I really like about this trilogy so far is watching how good, if taken too far, can lead to evil. The story also shows how undying loyalty can lead to dishonor.   Finally, I wish all DL novels were written like this trilogy. This series seems like it is meant for a slightly older/ smarter audience, which is a welcome change from other fantasy. The author pulls this off nicely without being wordy or overly descriptive.   The ending was very cool and I'm ready to read the next one 
 The werewolf phenomenon is about more than the traditional idea of a guy turning into a wolfman when the moon is full. If you're only interested in that aspect, try reading some young adult literature. But if you're also fascinated by the concept that humanity can be transcended, exploring our connections to other creatures and savage behavior, this book is a page-turner. As usual, Steiger's name is a mark of quality, and his vision is broad 
 Read about the year baseball became America's favorite pastime.  This thoroughly researched book is so much fun, you don't even need to be a baseball fan to enjoy it 
 I did enjoy reading Dr. Firlik's book though at times it tended to skip around from one subject to another. This is not another "House of God" and I am sure was never intended to be. This is not another Oliver Sachs type of book. It is a solid work and she does write well.It is the story of her 7 year neurosurgery training and that was interesting to me. I have known a number of neurosurgeons and they have some things in common - competence and intensity. She seems to fit that mold. Her last chapter speculating about advances in neurosurgery was most intertesting to me.   She went to a medical school that attracts and accepts non-traditioinal students - in other words students who have not taken the usual premedical undergraduate approach and may have majored in the humanities, engineering or have had previous life experiences or interest.  I suspect she is one of those 
 While the book was a bit "wordy" at times, (not sure if that has anything to do with the translation) I enjoyed reading it. I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know how the story line would unfold. As others have mentioned, it left some questions unanswered but I didn't feel like the story came to an abrupt end. This book was well worth my time and shed some light on the Arab-Israeli conflict; how people live with the conflict, what it's like on a daily basis, the treatment of Arabs in the region etc. 
 This book is well written and informative. In the quiet costs, they neglect to talk about capital gains tax impact on profit - I think this is very important to add into the equation. 
 Ellen Allien, DJ, techno artist, producer, and founder of the BPitch Control record label out of Berlin, teams up with another German producer and artist, Apparat. Prior to Ochestra of Bubbles, Allien's last release Thrills produced some excellent tech house and minimal tracks, but also had too many stale spots for a 10 track album. It wasn't quite as good as her stunning album before that, Berlinette. Now this teaming with Apparat has brought together one of the best electronic artist albums I've ever heard.  Right from the first two standout singles off the album, Turbo Dreams with it's pulsating beats and flowing horn, to Ellen's pop-like vocals on possibly the best track on here, Way Out, you know this is going to be something special. Track 3 was a little downgrade, with it's building strings sounding like a horror or war movie score, but tracks 4-10 were just incredible, eye-popping slices of techno that kept me spellbound through the start of each new track.   The one track voiced by Apparat, Leave Me Alone, is the low point of the album, with some awkward sounding vocals meshed with a very cheesy pop like melody. Right after that is the one boring instrumental on the CD, Edison, a crackily minimal track which literally goes nowhere. The CD closes with an incredible breathy downtempo vocal track sung by breathy, German accented Ellen, which I could have taken a 10 minute dose of instead of the 4:58 time.  I had sampled each track online because after Thrills, I thought it might be a case where I only wanted to download some of the tracks, but when I heard each of the tracks, they all sounded so good I just had to get the whole thing and I am glad I did, as I got 11 out of 13 solid electronic tracks.   FYI: There's already two good remixes out there of Turbo Dreams, plus and elongated track of the album version, and an upcoming remix of Way Out by Robag Wruhme that I just heard of sample of and I'm dying to get my hands on 
 I liked it, but I got this with several other books as a set for a very low price.  So for me, it's worth the money.   I think kids would love to read this out loud. 
 It's small enough to fit in my little kitchen.  It works as advertised.  The waffles were fast to make.  Clean up is easy.  Hardly any needed.  I made mine very light (folded in whipped egg whites after the batter was all mixed up.)  I can imagine making these heart shaped waffles for dessert 
 The second sentence of Helen Vendler's reading of Sonnet 23 is hidden away inside the sneaky-pete parentheses of a green girl. Here then, released to a just and proper scrutiny, is what the A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University set down so sheepishly:  "I represent the sonnet with the emended LOOKS in line 9, following Evans, though plausible arguments have been made for the Quarto's BOOKS."  Ha! Plausible arguments? Are you insane? There is no argument here--BOOKS ever it was and BOOKS ever it shall be. The word BOOKS is the very stuff and current of Old Will's song to himself in this sublime sonnet. Otherwise his achingly gorgeous description of reading in the last line--"to heare wit eies"--loses its chief power to delight. To think that this poem is anything other than a gifted artisan's celebration of his own literary bequest to mankind is simply an obtuseness born of too many universities. LOOKS my eye! To read LOOKS reduces this timeless verse to the merely--and meagerly--personal. And who's this Evans anyway? Some soggy-breeked Welsh halfwit no doubt. What's he got then Helen that lures you so? Is it the elbow patches? His pipe perhaps? Get a hold of yourself woman, this is William Shakespeare we are dealing with here! Which reminds me, isn't the spelling of the word "abondance" in the Quarto version of Sonnet 23 a gigantic satisfaction? That o in there just about kills me. I might not have thought so up to this point, being something of a halfwit myself, but Elizabethan English can really be a sight for sore eyes. The five stars are all for Shakespeare 
 Excellent.  This book is to Private Equity what Monkey Business is to Investment Banking and Liars Poker is to Bond Traders.  A must read for any one who deals with Wall Street 
 This is my only Kamji dictionary, so I don't really have a comparison for it, but I find it extremely useful.  The option to look up compounds by any of the kanji is of immense utility to me.       I have a more divided opinion on the simplified radical system they use.  I don't know how much more difficult it would be to search through all 214 radicals rather than the 79 that Hadamitzky and Spahn use, but i do have occasional problems deciding which radical to use when none seem to match exactly.        They do include a feature to help in this regard.  Similar looking kanji are listed in the chart under the wrong radical with a pointer to the correct entry.      All in all a worthy tome and one which sees great usage in my hands 
 Although just as exagerated as any movie ever made, this is a great lesson in what life was like in the "jazz and swing" era. It touches the realities of parents not wanting their kids to play drums (still happens) and many of the darker topics of the music business. Sal Mineo does a brilliant job portraying the drummer who brought drums into the spotlight for the first time in modern history. Any musician should especially enjoy this 
   The Grim Grotto has Violet, Klaus and Sunny aboard a submarine where a crazed Captain is obsessed with finding the sugar bowl before Count Olaf. While Klaus starts getting close to the Captain's stepdaughter Fiona. She's a book a worm too, well when it comes to learning about mushrooms. One of the funnier parts has has her stepfather alreday planning their wedding and having the two blushing. While saying "and Violet can marry my stepson once we find him again, Aye!". The book has it's slow points but it's still one of the best of the books since it has some surprises. Plus when Sunny gets poisoned by a deadly mushroom, Klaus and Violet have to figure out how to cure her and get away from Count Olaf at the same time.      Olaf is surprisingly about as whacky as Jim Carrey played him this time around. He introduces many new goofy laughs and is harder to take serious this time around. The books had a better and more sinister Olaf than the movie until I read this book. He seems to get more and more annoying as the books go on anyway and he's certainly his most annoying here. The book is still creative and the most intriguining enough for me to strongly recommend it. I honestly liked it more than most of the books. 
 Here's another omnibus edition of Gary Larson's weird, wacky and utterly hilarious cartoons. To enter Larson's world is to enter a world where animals have meaningful conversations, bugs make their homes in nice suburban houses, flies fly planes etc, etc. Certainly not the mainstream kind of cartoon but for anyone who likes 'off the wall' type humour this is a 'must buy'. Absolutely hilarious 
 Tesla is amazing, and it brings me back to my high school days!  Fun stuff, and highly recommended for anyone who loves listening to good guitar and a unique voice 
 In the beginning on the story Detective Kincaid receives a call at 2:00 AM in the morning. They found a car abandoned, the driver gone without a trace.   What happens next is that the driver turns out to be Qunicy's wife, Quincy of whom is a profiler on Kincaid's team. It looks like Rainie may be dead, but that is before they notice signs of a kidnapping. As they search further, they find a note for ransom of 10,000 dollars. Instructions are left and if not followed exactly, Rainie will die.  Quincy is devastated. He and Rainie had great future plans to adopt a child. Their marriage however, had been on the rocks for awhile as Rainie was an alcoholic. She was also a mentor to this foster kid, Dougie Jones. Quincy didn't like this either, as he thought it was a dangerous situation.  The story gets scarier as the kidnapper raises the stakes for demands of money. Every time they come closer to locating this monster who has Rainie, and later Dougie, the team runs into more and more obstacles. Rainie is fighting to stay alive under the worst circumstances, while trying to watch out for Dougie who may not come out alive either. After trying to escape many times, the kidnapper always captures them again and injures them a little bit more so Rainie especially can hardly move.  Quincy, Kincaid, and the other members of their team are not so sure they'll get them out alive. Not without putting their own lives in serious danger 
 Amazing!  For the students who studied directly with Arnold Jacobs,  "Protrait of an Artist" will take you back to his studio, sitting  right next to him.  This excellent collection of lectures (lessons) and  demonstrations are a fantastic embodiment of Arnold Jacobs' concepts and  teachings.  It is certainly a must  for any music performer or educator.   From the samples of CSO performances at the end of this CD to the practice  tapes, the music on this CD is truely inspirational 
 This book is a great family read.  It covers three generations on a family farm.  This illustrations are awesome.  Patricia MacLachlan has written a great book for young children along similar lines as her Sarah, Plain and Tall series.  I would recommend this book to anyone 
 All of the characters have a defined personality.  You know where they came from, what they feel and can get a sense of why they act the way they do.  I think it's a wonderful idea to write a preface just to describe the characters.  Now in the book he can get right to the point of the story 
 Boethius was certainly a bright spot in the midst of a darkening world flooded by barbarians and intellectually on the decline.  Boethius was among the many commentators and compilers of his age who endeavored to preserve the tenets of Greek Philosophy.  His commentaries on the original Greek texts of Aristotle helped to pave the way for Aquinas' "Summa Theologia."  So Boethius' works, though lacking originality, nevertheless made a very significant impact upon the later scholastic philosophers, and to the whole of Catholic tradition as well.  Italy, during Boethius' time, was under the rule of Theoderic the Ostrogoth, who unjustly imprisoned the statesman/philosopher, falsely accussing him of treason.  While waiting for his execution, Boethius wrote his "Consolation of Philosophy." The book itself is among the masterpieces of all time, and the only thing as tradgic as Boethius' untimely death is the fact that we were not able to obtain anymore works from this genius with the golden pen.  Had he remained alive, it is very likely that we would have seen a sublime synthesis, in Latin, of Plato and Aristotle, not contradicting each other but complimenting one another.  However, in short, this book is a small manifestation of what may have happened if he lived longer.  What is interesting about this book is that it handles several different perspectives, namely that of the sorrowful Boethius and the consoling wisdom of Lady Philosophy, written both in eloquent prose and dazzling verse, which together ultimately culminates into a one of the most moving, inspiring, and thought provoking philosophical works of all time. The book is indefatigable, in that it never seems to quit opening new corridors of thought; and it is essential, because it is the philosopher's ideal breviary.  It is interesting to note - and this is certainly not a negation to his Christian convictions - that while this Saint was awaiting his execution he remebered Athens, not Calvary 
 Nice and clean sound.    I bought these as side surround speakers...I didn't read carefully...there are no brackets to mount them.  I nailed on picture frame hangers.   Low keyed nice looking speakers.  Adam West L  
 There are some writers whose talent is so special that you want to save their books and make the reading of them an occasion. Walter Mosley is one of those writers. He invests his characters with such depth, such full histories that you cannot help but care about them. RL's Dream is populated by a cast of such characters; even the most minor ones (including a baby) are fully fleshed and very real. Soupspoon and Kiki are two almost-lost souls who bring each other back to life in unexpected ways. It is a credit to Mosley's rare and splendid talent that the book itself resonates with music; its cadence is almost audible in the spare prose, the all-too-human behavior of people who, often, do things without even really knowing why. To comprehend the blues, to put words, literally, to a musical theme and to do so in a kind-hearted and deeply understanding fashion is to deliver magic in the form of a book. This is a "must read" novel 
 What's Happening To Home? Balancing Work, Life, And Refuge In The Information Age by veteran journalist Maggie Jackson is an effective, "reader friendly" guide for the twenty-first century, focusing as it does on the invasion of telecommunication, e-mail, and the onward march of information technology to deliver more work to one's home doorstep - as well as the increasing American trend to take just about everything short of the actual office home after the official workday has ended. What's Happening To Home? addresses very real contemporary concerns, concentrating on practical and effective guidelines to balance work and home life for a happier and healthier future. What's Happening To Home? is a fascinating, informative, highly recommended account that speaks to everyone caught up in the manifold pressures of the digital age 
 From historic wineries in California's Sonoma and Napa Counties to back roads, lodging in small retreats, and dining in recommended establishments, Hidden Wine Country seeks to uncover less-traveled roads in the Wine Country - and does it successfully. Hidden Wine Country is quite an achievement for an area over-saturated with publicity: the authors specialize in finding the unusual, quality experience. Hidden Wine Country is a highly recommended "take-along" guide 
 Love Bass sandals.  These are comfortable even if you happen to be on your feet all day.  Can't usually say that about any sandals.  These are cushy and provide support for your arches.  Not a lot of arch support but more than my other sandals provide.  Very quality made and cute 
 I really recomend this book because it talks about Latina women including famous women who are Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican and from other Latin American countries.  This book includes famouse female Latina singers like Selena. I learned a lot about her, that she was born in 1971 and died in 1995. She had one brother and one sister. Selena had sold more than 35,000 CD'S before her unfortunate death.  This book has 11 chapters and 13 women are featured in each chapter. This book explains when the women were born and when they died and what they accomplished in their lives.   Another woman I will like to talk about is Julia Alvarez. She is a great Dominican writer. Alvarez won the 2002 Nebraska Book Award for ''Before We Were Free.'' Also Mrs. Alvarez wrote the book ''In the Time of the Butterflies'' to remember the real life murder of the Three Mirabals sisters who were assassinated for the opposition of the dictator Rafael Trujillo.   If you want to know more information about Selena, Julia Alvarez and other Latina women read ''The Book of Latina Women.''  I really recommened this book for anyone ages 10 and up.  This book meant  a lot to me because it talks about women from my culture and my friends' cultures. It is also important for us to learn about successful women from many cultures.   You can be someone like the Latina women from your culture;   these women are good role models for all of us.                                                                              Shaina     
 Paley's argument for a designer is relevant to any historical discussion on the origins debate. The Coachwhip Publications 2005 reprint edition (ISBN 1930585217) is inexpensive and contains an additional bibliography of more recent teleological arguments 
 Elegantly simple.  Excellently clear.  Powerfully thought-provoking.  Money well spent.  Your interest and attention focused upon these concepts will benefit the quality of your life a kazillion-fold.   This is high priority, first class, useful life information.  I particularily enjoy the question and answer format for it forever stimulates new questions in me. Jerry is a thorough questioner.  His questions resonate with my own. Do not be fooled by the simplicity and clarity.  Time and again, I discover I can read the same passages on a new day and they will repeatedly trigger new 'light bulb' self discovery moments. The same words continually open and I gain fresh new insight.  An aside.. I also love the beautiful violet cover with the acacia tree.  Giraffes love acacias.  With their very long necks it is easy for them to  reeeeeeach for that better feeling thought. And now with this book, so can we. 
 This is a wonderful book - for both children and adults.  The poems are creative, funny, engaging and very of the moment.  My toddler loves them and so do I 
 I think that Tracy Lawrence has one of the best voices in country music. He has a distintive sound that separates him from the crowd. And he certainly does have a knack for the humourous songs. Better than a lot of artists today. And each and every song on this album is a good song. The booklet includes all lyrics and some photos of Tracy 
 orson wells once said that if he could bring a movie to heaven(or hell) when he died, that movie should be 'the battle of algiere'. indeed, that movie is really really good. by the same token, i think if he could read robert ludlum's 'the matarese circle', he definitely would have included another item in his carry-on-to-the-heaven. yes, that's how fascinating and fantastic of this thriller. this is how a spy thriller should be, how a masterpiece of this genre should be defined. some of the other great books that i'd also recommend mr. wells to read in heaven(or hell) he never got the chance to read during his era are: 'lonesome dove', 'brules', 'the last hero', 'the kite runner', 'the parsifal mosaic' (also by ludlum), 'shantarum(?)', all of stephen hunter's 'swagger series (except 'havana'), all of michael connelly's "harry bosch(?) series (but exclude 'trunk music', 'a darkness as dark as ???'", gerald a. browne(?) '19 purchase st.', '11 harrow house(?)', 'green ice'.... well, enough for his carry-on for now 
 This is by far the best book I've read on children's nutrition. Dr. Galland combines good sense with good science. My children's behavior and immunity have much improved since I began to follow a whole foods aproach to their diet. Dr. Galland makes it easy to understand the relationship between diet and good health. He doesn't merely suggest the foods to be avoided and included, but helps you to plan out meals with the help of recipes and quantities of foods and EFA oils. A must for the private library of any parent 
 i purchased this sprayer to us with spray butter, well it does work but a full pump only get a small amount of spray probably because it is so thick but it still sprays better than the plastic bottle the butter comes with, it is easy to pump the bottle so i think it is worth the trouble to me hope this help 
 This book is terrific! SEND has inspired me to 'think before I send' and to put more clarity into my emails, resulting in fewer email 're: re: re:' queries. SEND also reminded me that while email is great, it is still important to pick up the phone or talk in person.  I plan on dropping by a colleague's office to share this book.  After reading SEND, you'll probably want to do the same.    
 A truly original series of non-stop laughs.  Pay attention, there is a lot of subtle humor that is brilliant but not always caught the first time around.  Dangle and the gang are great 
 This shaving cream was very enjoyable to use. You only need an amount the size of a nickel or quarter in your palm to get a good lather. I do not use the badger hair brush yet but my shave is very comfortable and it smells good. It also has made shaving a more enjoyable experience for me which is worth a few bucks right there ! I tried the T & H West Indies Lime and the 1805 traveler size as well. The 1805 also smells good and the West Indies Lime had a bit of a musty, lime scent to it. You may want a more distinct lime scent but I have not tried any others with this smell. 
 This book is should be an essential for anyone writing for children. Horning covers all the genres, offering insight into pacing, character and plot. She better defines what makes a picture book, an early reader, a  chapter book, a mid-grade and a young adult -- definitions that are often  murky in writing books. Although this book may have been intended for  librarians and others in the book industry, I recommend it highly for  anyone contemplating writing for children 
 This classic little booklet from Charles Hummel was one of the earliest resources (first published in 1967) to first introduce the distinction between the important and the urgent that later time and/or life management books such MacKenzie's "The Time Trap" and Covey's "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" incorporated.  But Hummel introduced it in a Christian and Biblical context where God's Will and Word take precedence in determining what's important.  This resource is a simple introduction to time management using the following four steps: decide what's important, discover how one's time is now being spent, budget the hours and follow through.  Each step is given some exposition.  If one already has Hummel's newer book "Freedom from Tyranny of the Urgent," then this booklet isn't necessary since it is essentially incorporated into the book.  But for those Christians who have an initial adversity to the whole concept of time management and scheduling and don't see how it is integral to discipleship or produces greater freedom rather than bondage, this booklet may make you reconsider your belief.  For those who want more insight into time and life management from a Christian perspective, read Ken Smith's "It's About Time."  Hummel is one of many who recommends it 
 Keane is one of the greatest bands of all time. The fact that they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums on every song, with no guitars at all, shows that they are more musically sophisticated than all the other mindless guitar rock that's out there. There are more than enough guitar-based bands. "Somewhere Only We Know" is the best song of all time. Beautiful lyrics, solid piano backbone, and a steady, moderate tempo, make it a brilliant album-opener. The album has upbeat pop/rock, like "Bend and Break" and "This is the Last Time," slow, sorrowful ballads, like "She Has No Time" and "We Might as Well be Strangers," gentle, peaceful melodies, like "Sunshine," and slightly ethereal, unearthly ones like "Untitled 1" and "Bedshaped." Plus, all the lyrics are intensely personal and honest, ones that everyone can relate to, in one way or another. All together, the album is a classic, one that (if the American public knows anything about music) will live on to be known as one of the greatest albums ever made. Every song is a masterpiece. There are no fillers. 
 Fossils tell of long ago is a good book for children.  Brightly illustrated pictures help them grasp the facts of fossils.  It includes a fun experiment, too, along with a clear explanation of how fossils were made.  I give this book four stars 
 Excellent comedy sketches; I had seen KFM a long time ago, and was happy to see it out on DVD.  The Zuckers, Abrahams, and Landis delivered a hilarious, raunchy, side-splitting series of sketch comedy, and I can see where the Airplane movies etc followed.  Highly recommended 
 I've been a member of the Church all my life. I had doubts at various times in my life that caused worries. However, I did the best I could to face these with faith enough to believe they coud be resolved. I had little trouble believing Joseph Smith was a prophet with all that came forth at that time: so many miracles and momentous events and the BoMormon coming forth. I've always been in awe of the man. However, at one point, I began to wonder about later prophets. In the Doctrine and Covenants, I read a section from a later prophet with these doubts in mind. As I read it and finished reading it, I knew it was revelation. Since then, I never had that concern again. I'm really grateful for all that is taught through Joseph Smith, but I am just as grateful that I've gained a testimony of the truthfulness of the modern Church through a later prophet. This may not always be an easy read, but there is so much to be had in this amazing work. This isn't a good missionary tool, like the BoMormon, but it's something to be read and pondered on at some point.  
 VERY easy to read and follow!  Not a fad diet and you must follow it to the letter (or pretty close).  It is nutritionally sound and has the added benefit of actually INCREASING your metabolic rate so that you don't "yo-yo" when you're done.  Myself and 3 co-workers all did it together and we all lost 5 to 10 lbs in 14 days.  Weight continued to fall off over the next couple of months without my really trying.  It was the only diet I've ever done and I was Immensely SATISFIED!! 
 This is the most comfortable bra I ever wore.  It fits perfectly, provides excellent support for my breasts and still allows maximum exposure of my breasts (36C) with just a hint of nipple exposure on the top.  The lace is soft and comfortable and allows more than a hint of my nipples to show through any top I wear.  I cannot recommend or say enough about it - if you are not a prude and you like sexy underwear - this is the bra for you 
 I like the trend in cookbooks towards simple, quick meals.  How many of us have the time to take hours to prepare a meal outside of the holidays?  Mexican cooking can be intimidating but Rick Bayless takes the complication out of it with this great book of simple yet delicious recipes.  While the recipes are designed to be prepared in 30 minutes, I think the average home cook will be looking at 15 - 30 minutes longer, depdending on thier skill and quickness.  Still, even 45 minutes isn't bad for some of these recipes.  Rick has essentially dumbed down the recipes to make the preperation with more common ingredients, easily found in your pantry or grocery store.  While the recipes may be scaled down and simplified, there certainly seems to be no effect on the taste.  His tips for cutting prep time are not only vital to the recipes in this book, but to your home cooking in general.  The book is laid out by section in the usual manner:  Salads, side dishes, soups, main dishes, desserts, etc...I'm still not all that experimental so the section on Tacos, enchiladas, tostadas, was my favorite and my family and I really enjoyed the varitions on these more common dishes such as the green chile chicken tacos, as well as the grill prepared recipes as we grill a lot.  The Chicken Tortilla soup with Avacado was another winner.    Rick proves that Mexican need not be intimidating and time consuming.  This is a book that I am happy to have in my collection 
 I give 5 stars to books that were life changing or else supremely entertaining.  This book is one that helps turn tospy turvy archaic patriarchical ideas that may not really have had any palce in Islam in the first place

 This book was the first in a series of about eight books I read in a single month on religion and theology. The purpose of my reading such an extensive list in a short amount of time was for me to be drawn closer to God through inspirational reading. St. Mary of Egypt, the main character in the three long poems in the book, is a Saint popular in the East, especially in Eastern Orthodoxy but in Eastern Catholicism as well. She spent most of her life in a state of sin, but finally did great penance to become one of the greatest Saints of Christendom. The story is marvelously amazing since it taught me that no matter how sinful one may feel, God extends mercy to those who seem furthest away from him. The book gets extra props from me since it is a collection of three medieval verses from the West about a Saint little known in the West. Hopefully, one day we in the West will learn to share in the wisdom of the Christian East and the East will share in the theological nature of the West and the Church will breathe, as Pope John Paul II said, with two lungs again East (mystical and contemplative) and West (rational). The book is rather short and makes an entertaining light read. It serves as a good introduction into the Cistercian Studies series which brings the mystical and little known to a popular audience. Good work : 
 A metric is a form of measurement, which can be used to determine the level of success or failure. However, in anything more complex than the counting of points, it is possible to measure more than one thing and often more than one interpretation is possible. Therefore, when choosing to create and use any type of measuring tool, you not only must select the right one, know how to use it, how much to use it you also must understand how to interpret the results. Embedded in this is also the sometimes even more important adage of knowing when not to use a measuring tool.   Marketing is one of the main pillars of any successful company, yet is often the most difficult one to manage. Determining the cost of a marketing plan is easy, but selecting one that will work and determining how well it worked are both very hard. So hard that many companies really have little idea how well they are doing in these areas.   This book will help you solve all that, as the title suggests, many different ways in which marketing effectiveness can be measured are given. They are split into the following categories:  *) Share of hearts and minds *) Margins and profits *) Product and portfolio management *) Customer profitability *) Sales force and channel management *) Pricing strategy *) Promotion *) Advertising media and web metrics *) Marketing and finance *) The marketing metrics x-ray   This is not a book where the author(s) simply spout theoretical jargon, quantitative terms and formulas are used everywhere. Furthermore, the terms are explained in great detail and in terminology that can be understood by anyone with the intelligence to be in management.   In the modern business world, every department must not only pull their own weight, they also must be able to argue their points and be able to back up their claims with hard data. Marketing is often thought of as an area where the decibel level of the wind is more important than the sounds and the direction. This book will help keep you from being the target of such accusations 
 I have read three other books by George M. Marsden. He is sympathetic to Liberal Protestantism, which he likes to call mainline. On occasion he will argue that the Fundamentalist are an obstruction to Christianity being tolerated on the college campus. My view is that Fundamentalism is Christianity. That the type of Christianity taught and argue for on many college campus is worse then atheism. This work by Marsden writes a clear picture of such philosophical faith with little grounding in the Bible as record of historic fact.  Marsden  does present a picture where Christians rather have a school move away from Christianity then allow the Catholic church to have their own schools. My disagreement with the Catholic Church is large. But I think they are much closer to reality then Mainline Protestantism as depicted in this  book. Page 17 tells of Henry Slove Coffin attempts to Shepherd away the American University from evangelicalism.  I like to think of it as sort of Ethics for Damnation. To use church to teach a moral structure. Instruct not about God as creator and supernatural ruler of the universe. In a manner teach God is holy, that God hates sin- but to dissuade it from condemnation. Christian Faith is matter of persuasion. The Bible is a book of philosophy and moral tales, not a source of ultimate truth. Myth, ethical stories, not the ultimate truth from God. Chapel is a place to persuade ethical moral behavior - but in reality God does not really exist. This is the Christianity Harvard and the University wanted to teach from their beginning.  Marsden finds this as ideal. Leaders of many University wanted to train young men into some moral structure. Marsden laments that the university no longer tries. My feelings is if this is the purpose of mandatory chapel on the college campus - good riddance. Ethics derived by men, do not need the bible. The Bible is to be used to understand God's will. Not to keep some sort of cultural Christianity that is devoid in any belief that there is an actual supernatural being.  Religious Faith is part of the fabric of society. When one studies society, known as social studies is part of the subject manner why people behave and interact with each other in a certain manner. My question is how sociology incorporates and makes value judgements about hip- hop, rock and roll music, premarital sex television viewing, thoughts on David Hume and/or Descartes, Paul the Apostle, Moses or Jesus Christ. Compare how the teachings of Mohamed and the teachings of Jesus. The implications of religious belief is a fundamental part of studying Sociology.  Herbert Spencer is critical of religious faith and made a value judgement that all faith in a supernatural being is wrong headed and ought  to be dissuaded from in society. Should such an introductory book be used in a "Christian University" or a neutral public University. Should such a decision be left up to the individual professor. This was a debate in 19th century Harvard. Page 23 in this book 
 I LOVE this DVD, in fact I purchased 5 to give as Baby Shower Extras! I originally taped it from HBO, and my 3 Grandchildren almost wore it out! I was delighted to see it available on DVD, so I bought 5, and am keeping one in my DVD Library for my Great-Grandchildren some day to enjoy! 
 Thanks to AMAZON'S recommended books and reviews, I discovered this delightful series.  Elizabeth Peters does a wonderful job combining mystery, history and archeology into a fast paced story that entertains the reader.  Then of course we can't forget the romance (implied, naturally).   In my opinion, THE LAST CAMEL DIED AT NOON is the best of the first six books in the series (the first one did get me hooked).  The concept of finding a lost city hidden in the middle of the desert was brilliant.  We are also introduced to Nefret who not only becomes the Emerson's adopted daughter but an integral part of the rest of the Peabody series. And, I am absolutely thrilled to discover a series of books where there are at least 20 already written.  I don't have to wait for the next one; I can just go straight through! 
 Gregg Olsen has done it again! Another excellent true crime book. A fascinating story, masterfully written. I recommend this one 
 My children,ages 14, 10, and 8 really enjoyed this book. The main character,Myles, gets into all kinds of mischief. He makes the book fun. We used this book at the end of a homeschool Middle Ages unit study. I wish we would have used it in the beginning. This book, in my opinion, is the best by Howard Pyle 
 If you write or work with W2K device drivers, this is the book for it.  As a bonus, the writing is much more colorful than most development books.  I highly recommend it 
 I first read A Short History while on business in Australia. I couldn't put it down. The writing is outstanding and the information is communicated in language that anyone can understand. I have been re-reading A Short History with my kids, and they love it. This is a book for all ages 
 As she kicks off the ninth book in this series Lilian Jackson Braun reintroduces her readers to the resort town of Mooseville. This is where Jim Qwilleran was staying when he inherited millions or billions of dollars; he isn't sure which it is yet. Of course we know that wherever Qwilleran and his cats Koko and Yum Yum go there is going to be a mystery and although the mystery in this book develops slowly it is always there, lurking in the background. Like the other books in this series, the mystery here is light and almost incidental to the story but the depth and richness of the characters and setting more than make up for any lack of intrigue.   This story really begins when Qwilleran and his pals return to the lakeside cabin in Mooseville and settle in for the summer. Almost immediately he has to call out a plumber and from there Qwilleran's trials continue and include leaky pipes, a mouse hole, a tornado and finally a body buried beneath the cabin. To make matters worse, Qwilleran decides to enlarge the cabin but finds that all of the licensed carpenters are busy working on local developments until the end of the season so he ends up hiring unlicensed carpenters who keep disappearing.   Unlike some of the previous books in this series the clues as to what is going on and who is involved are clear and easily identifiable in this book. In some of the other books there have been no clues at all until the end but I figured this one out long before the book was over. I was mistaken about the motive however and would never have put two and two together if Koko had not forced Qwilleran and me to look at the evidence, which was setting in the cabin in a paper bag. It is a good thing that Koko made his move when he did for Qwilleran himself was a suspect in the murder of one Ignatius K. Small, a carpenter who could go to sleep while nailing shingles on a roof.   For fans of this series Qwilleran's trip back to Mooseville will be a welcome change of pace and will allow long time fans to get reacquainted with the people and places of this resort town. Braun's rich writing style and her colorful characters are the core elements of the entire series and this book is no exception. No, this is not a hard core mystery but it is a fun and very enjoyable read 
 ...always pick David Sedaris. His writing never let's you down.  He is always engaging and hilariously funny...but he never stoops to trying to hard by being gross.  His situations and characters are outlandish...but there's always a grain of truth and realism.  Which makes the humor all the more satisfying.  It's vivid, alive, funny and even touching at times.  And they are the kind of stories that you can read every few years...seeing the characters again is like visiting old friends 
 This is a very small book about a very big topic - ladies shoes which have a long tradition of making women look and feel better. The author Linda O'Keeffe starts with the history of shoes and covers different areas such as sandals, heels, slippers, black dress shoes, boots, platform shoes, fetish shoes and art shoes. She also has little features on famous shoe designers such as Andre Perugia, Roger Vivier, Manolo Blahnik, David Evins, Patrick Cox, Dave Little, Salvatore Ferragamo, Vivienne Westwood and Beth Levine. What makes this book so attractive are the many excellent pictures of different shoe designs 
 I am a reiki master. As I started reading this book I was struck by the simularities between Dana energy and Reiki energy. I believe them to be the same. This book explained some of the imagery in my initiation visions. It is a great book for energy workers and those who are begining or in the process of shamanic initiations. This book is more profound than his first book. It is more on am intermediate level. I strongly recomend it and for those more interested in Dana energies I recomend Reik 
 My 7 yr old daughter says "she loves it. It has a code that you have to figure out."  We got this from library, and she loved it so much, we bought a copy 
 My 4th grade daughter absolutely loves this CD!  This CD is such a valuable learning tool and it reinforces the times tables.  I highly recommend this as well as the other Sara Jordan CDs, i.e.; Division Unplugged, Additional Unplugged and Subtraction Unplugged.... WE HAVE THEM ALL 
 I used to recommend people start with Myths to Live By, but now I think people should start with Pathways To Bliss. It's just a fantastic overview of the ideas that Joseph Campbell expands on and reiterates throughout his other books.   I started reading this book and my wife was joking with me, saying all you have to do is read the last paragraph to get the gist of the book. So as a joke I turned to the last paragraph and read it out loud to her. It was so moving, well, that was it, we both read the book cover to cover together.  It's just an amazingly affirmative view of life and nobody explains the mysteries of the cosmos better than Joseph Campbell. I'm a huge fan of his, and this book is the best one yet 
 This book is great!  The first advice book I have ever read where I can actually use the advive that is given.  The book is categorized perfectly so you do not have to read from the beginning to the end, you can just pick up the book anywhere and get some GREAT advice on how to make the stresses of everyday life a little less stressful.  I carry this book in the car with me so if I have some spare time (usually while I am waiting for the carpool to pile in) I can get some good advice 
 Although I have liked Bach's music for a while, this Cd was the first version of these cantatas I heard - and it was marvelous to me! It is full of life and joy and expresses the lyrics in my opinion to the full: "Heart and Mouth and Deed and Life must give witness to Christ" (the translation of the opening chorus) I was more familiar with "Jesus, Joy of man's desiring" of the same canatata and was surprised at the other beautiful pieces.  The translation of the words in the booklet realy brought the music to life, as you I could read what the composer was expressing through notes. His expression fit perfectly.   Although some debate the technical side of J Rifkin's idea of using only 1 tenor, bass, soprano and alt instead of the choir, I liked it very much. Some choirs battle to do some parts of 140 and 147 Cantatas so to me the crisp and clear words and sounds were enjoyable. Personally I would fully reccommend it but with a challenge: Don't just listen to the sound and tune - let the words sink in... That's what its all about 
 This coffee table is great for the money. Well packed for shipping and easy to put together 
 Wow whar a great cd. One of my 20 fafoutites cd I ever heard. Freddy Chico Spice weezy bomb music. This 1996 the platinum era of the bestr rap. The best song are CAN U FEEL IT & E-40, Surivival, Tales of the Niggas Who Got Crept On, 1-800 straight From the Pen. This is in my opinion the last great lp from Spice 1. the rest who dropp after 1996 is worst. But in my opinion 2 best spice records, I don't known who is the best is Amerikkazz Nightmare and 1999-Sick and the thierd is 187 He wrote also classizzzzzz.

Peace from Warsaw Praga Po³udnie Grochów side Even in Poland Spice 1 have got some tru fans 
 I agree that this book is indeed over-written and reads at time like a class assignment; the author simply ticking off facts without much coherent thesis.  However, this recital does bring off a charming story interesting enough to hold the attention of the casual historian with only a passing interest in wildlife.  For anyone wishing to immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the American wilderness and the struggles of the early settlers, it is a pleasure.  Just skip over the boring bits 
   3 women entering a new phase in their lives decide to leave the extended care home they've been living in and move to a new place in the foot hills of North Carolina. This is the story of how they take a chance and learn to live the lives they choose, instead of letting husbands, children or fate decide for them.    The Covington Novels are well written yet easy to read. I would recommend this series of books, especially to women of middle age 
 A classical music buff, & up until August had never heard of IZ.  In an airport in Botswana, awaiting a plane to Johannesburg (delayed for several hours), I observed a distinguished-looking man, sitting completely relaxed, with a smile on his face, listing to his iPod.  Finally, out of boredom I commented about how un-stressed he seemed to be; he promptly passed over his earphones.  WOW!  It was Iz singing "Over the Rainbow" (a song I am completely and thoroughly sick of!) Of course, his version was familiar and for the first time in years, I loved the song.  Unfortunately, I then forgot the artist's name. Thank goodness it came back to me.  Bought this CD at probably the last Tower Music Store in the nation, along with 15 others (all classical) and can't stop playing it. Right now I'm in the process of buying this album for a friend, along with all the rest of his collection.    So long, Beethoven!  (Not really, but this is a whole new wonderful addition to my listening life.) I think IZ belongs in every top-notch music portfolio 
 I have read most of Conroy's books, and I have highly enjoyed his style of writing in each of his works.  "The Lords of Discipline" is simply a masterpiece.  The story takes place at the Citadel in Charleston, SC. Will McLean, is a basketball player who, despite having mixed feelings about the institute, has established three extremely close friends and has found a niche as the Captain of the basketball team his senior year. Things start going astray when he is asked by "The Bear", the disciplinary Dean, to watch out for the first Black cadet to be allowed to enroll in the school (in the mid 1960s). In trying to protect the young man from unjust hazing and torture, Will comes upon a secret organization known as "The Ten". His knowledge of the organization puts him and his roomates in great danger, as Will faces challenges that nearly break him. This book is not only beautifully written, but is Conroy's most intense.  It is certainly one of the best books I have ever read 
 I first read this book many years ago.  It has since remained my most favorite story of all time.  Gabriel Garcia Marquez's story-telling is magnetic.  In this book, he brilliantly chronicles South America's riches, struggles and history, and so genuinely captures the many forms of love.    While many episodes and many characters sweep through this novel; Fermina and Florentino's relationship is the most memorable.  Theirs isn't the perfect love story.  In fact, it is anything but.  Florentino's love for Fermina is tortured and desperate and heart-achingly futile.  But this raw honesty is what captures you.  It is an immortal and unchanging love that is self-deprecating and masochistic yet so pure.  Florentino Ariza's acts of love are so bizarre yet his loyalty is so endearing.    This is a love story for the annals.  Unchanging, unwavering and real.  Loyalty like this is the stuff of fairytales.  A must-read for hopeless romantics and a literary piece of hope for those who desperately want to believe.  
 I loved this book!  I liked how the chapters were short, so I could read it in snippets.  Elizabeth Gaskell is amazing.  I loved the characters and how well written the plot is 
 An extremeely useful book, in fact, just what I was looking fo 
 I really liked how the airport came with all the stuff that came in a real airport was in it, like the jetway, baggage claim, and the control tower was much better than I could make. The plane is pretty durable, and with the City Passenger Plane, you get two planes 
 An invaluable resource to homeschooling families to use with studies on coinage.  This delightful and moving story could easily be joined hand in hand with a study on the coins of America.  The content fully supports the  type of family values normally found in the homes were homeschooling is a  must 
 The 3 jam bands named Moe dispact and phish all have unique sounds yet they are all under the same title a jam band. If you have never listened to any of these bands i strongly recomend u try out some of there music go to kzzaa and search for these bnds. You will be happy with the search results. If i were u i would get 3 good freinds together before u download these and purchase a dank bag of some chronic. i recomend a quarter. THe pot helps u realize how good these bands really are!! 
 Creator Michael Moore's Adventures in a TV Nation chronicles the best episodes of this most radical experiment in mainstream television broadcasting. The Gay Men's Chorus serenades the home of Senator Jesse Helms from his front lawn. Janeane Garafolo and a small army of riffraff storm the public-yet-exclusive beach of Greenwich, Connecticut. A benefit concert is staged to raise funds for corporate welfare. An Emmy-nominated black actor and a convicted white felon see who can catch a cab faster in New York City. A red 18-wheeler emblazoned with the Soviet hammer and sickle freights Communist paraphenalia across the country, stopping at church socials, PTA functions, and Jerry Falwell's church en route. If you're a Michael Moore fan... I highly recommend this one 
 That's what this first book in the Father John O'Malley series is about.  This is an excellent mystery with a wonderful storyline as well.  Ms. Coel's characters are believable and she keeps the plot moving along at a really nice pace.  I really enjoyed this look at the life of the Native American on the Indian Reserve and also it gave me a chance to learn a little more about the Arapaho history.  Father John is a wonderful character, and I look forward to reading more of his adventures in future books.  And he and his sidekick Vicky have lots of motives to follow up on when an Indian tribal chief is found knifed in his tipi 
 Jen just spoke at my church this morning.  I have not read the book yet,  though and intend on doing so shortly.  Jen spoke about how she dealt with the pain and how her it is important for parents to understand that divorce is not a closed subject.  It effects children for years and decades to come.  She touched on the subject about how important it is for those children to see healthy marriage models as their own view may be broken and distorted.  Jen was a wonderful speaker and her growth as a christian showed as she spoke about her parents divorce at the age of 6 and her parents remarriages.  Definently recomende 
 This is an absolute must-read for anyone who rides dressage horses. It's like a basic textbook. For the earthbound, or for the rent-a-pony crowd, it will be a crashing bore. Podhajsky is not an easy-reading "how to ride" book. This is a very technical manual for serious riders, and it is engrossing. Podhajsky's attitude toward positive reinforcement as a training aid is right on, as is his discussion of how the training of horses was often misdirected in the past. My only complaint is that I wish there were more illustrations 
 I was so happy to know that truth. Massey tells us the truth on the racial origin of the humanity, when he told to the pagge 29-30, that the white was a creation of the black people so-called egyptians.  Now, I'am free of all  complex, I'am free because Massey with the book of the beginnings, gave me  the freedom. Thank you Massey, one black people of the louisiane.  (01/02/2000) timec@caramail.co 
 I am a fan of Cube, if it wasn't for Cube & Cypress Hill I wouldn't be into any Classic Gangsta Rap, I personally think Lethal Injection is much better than Amerikkka's Most Wanted or Death Certificate, though if it weren't for 1992's The Predator, I wouldn't be in to Cube!  The song Down 4 Whatever has the nice Gangsta Beat thats real slow, but What Can I Do? (Westside-mix) has the hardest beat off the Album!  But I don't care who you are, if your a West Coaster like me, the song You Know How We Do It has the best flow, and probably is 1 of Cube's best hits!  Cave Bitch is a pretty Funny ass song 2!  Overall, 2 me 1994 release Lethal Injection is 2nd to The Predator, here we go..... best songs are  3, *4, 5, 7, 8, 9, *10, 12, *13, 14, *15 & 16 
 My 3 yo loves this book, has since I bought it almost a year ago.  He LOVES tractors, and can just about quote this book word for word.  He LOVES to touch the pages, we have to read this almost EVERY night.  
 Our mattress is only 5 years old, but for the last year, my husband and I haven't been sleeping well and our bodies were aching every morning.  When we received this mattress pad as an early Christmas gift, we were thrilled!  Once he got it unpacked and laid flat, it took very little time to fluff up.  I slept better the very first night and when I wake in the morning, I'm not stiff and sore all over.  It has made a huge difference in just the last week.  I was concerned that it wouldn't fit under our sheets, but we've had no problems with that either.  It simply squishes down on the corners for us to fit the sheets over it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone 
 A really splendid package of menu's to suit all tastes and personalities. Our grandchildren refer to Pumpkin soups as Grandma's special soups and are always on the look out for variations, so this book has served as a wonderful insight to all the variations that are now possible. The fact that this book also includes a miriad of other recipes, not normally found in the UK, has proved a treasure and it looks as if we shall continue to grow a regular crop of these wonderful vegetables for many years to come 
  This book is much needed.  Stormie Omartian has tackled a low point in many Christian women's prayer life - praying for themselves.  She explains that it is not selfish to pray for yourself.  It is essential!  Praying for yourself invites God to improve and protect you.  When it comes time to give of yourself to others - you will have more to give.  Like her other "Power of a praying" books, she carefully pairs scripture with topics to pray about.  If praying prayers she has written word for word seems false to you, take the content and scripture and pray your own words.  From what I've read in the Bible, God doesn't care what words we use to pray, He looks at our heart.  I highly recommend this book.  It is a great tool for any woman 
 In his impressive body of work, Baudrillard seems to take an infinite amount of paths leading to a small set of concepts, or vectors upon which he observes society. One of those essential concepts dominating Baudrillard's work is that we can no longer make representations of the world we live in, because by now representation precedes reality, and as such is no longer a representation, but a model. Hence the end of the principle of reality, and the birth of the hyperreal, reality as nothing more than the simulation of a model. With this book, Baudrillard allows those concepts to come forward, very much like nerve cells, connecting and connected to his previous works, clarifying many of his obscure observations. Each word/theme works as a model throught which the world is, for lack of better word, simulated.  In many ways, those are the models upon which Baudrillard's work is generated, but I doubt it will be of much use to those who are not familiar with his work

 We love to listen to Christmas music at our house. This is a wonderful mixture of instrumental music. We liked it much more than the Windham Hill Christmas collection, which I bought at the same time 
 John Bradshaw does a beautiful job showing how we all carry a historical "inner child," the child we really were.  When that child did not get the love and nurturance that it needed, it will either act out or act in later in our adult years.  Bradshaw brilliantly shows the many ways in which the inner child got hurt and how it continues to contaminate our adult lives, unless and until we take steps to heal it.  This book does not dwell on self-pity or blame; rather it focuses on understanding what happened, why it happened, and then dedicates the majority of the pages to a constructive approach to healing the inner child so that we can live a full, happy life 
 This is a great film for kids and big kids! Its just simple humour but had me in stitches more than once, good characters and story. Good family viewing 
 Raymond Scott was an innovator of high order, bringing something a little wacky to the controlled world of written musical composition. This stuff is Amazingly hard to play, say the Musicians, and this recording shows the intricacy and skill of the arrangements in a way the original recordings could never do because of the limited recording techniques of the day. Although not as energetic or frantic as some of the originals, repeated listenings don't seem to wear you out like so many other novelty Jazz recordings. Try listening to an hour of Spike Jones for instance. Instead this stuff grows on you, leaving you wanting more 
 At least with a psychologist who is licensed one has a recourse. Often in therapy people who work with a counsellor whose values conflict with their own may find themselves confused and distorted. The reason why Christian or pastoral counselling works for some is that it as a discipline is designed to heal mind and soul. Same can be said for Buddhist and Jewish pastoral care. Secular psychology has gotten way too far out as the New Age movement influences many approaches to counselling. Then there is the business model of needing clients for income. Both factors play into the creation of dependance to keep one employed. When the soul heals it is incredible what happens. Besides ... if prayer turned around St. Augustine of Hippo ... it can turn around probably alot more people 
 I did this book for my literature class and I thought it was vey interesting. It reminded me somewhat of Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man". This book is vey interesting and is written by a man who is basically a minority where he is from due to his religion and up bringing. The book's main character is Makak who is ashamed of his identity as a black man and idealizes the moon because it is white. Eventually he learns to accept himself as he is 
 The collaboration of academicians Herman Daly (University of Maryland, School of Public Affairs) and Joshua Farley (Gund Institute of Ecological Economics, University of Vermont), Ecological Economics: Principles And Applications is a scholarly economics textbook that also incorporates the critical importance of such factors as clean air and water, species diversity, and social and generational equity. An introductory-level resource ideal for both students and non-specialist general readers with an interest in economics and ecology, Ecological Economics revolutionizes the traditional approach to a social science while retaining a tight grasp upon core driving principles of macroeconomics and microeconomics alike. A seamlessly integrated, holistic approach to understanding and appreciating the tangled complexities of the modern world 
 Jill hits the target on the mark with her hilarious take on both weddings and divorces.  Anyone who has sat through a truly awful wedding or divorce (or worse, been a direct participant!) will find themselves cracking up over the stories within.  I found myself chuckling the next day at work while retelling these tales within my head!  This is the perfect gift for your girlfriends that 'get it'!  
 No solo para los RPG Fans  --------------------------  Se que hay muchos que no gustan de los RPG's, de hecho yo mismo no soy fan de estos. Asi que al empezar a jugar Oblivion lo hice solo por curiosidad, por probar que tan buenas eran las graficas y el gameplay. Al principio no me pareciï¿½ gran cosa... pero cuando sales la primera vez a campo abierto... Increï¿½ble! te quita el aliento. Una vez empiezas a recorrer todo el reino de Tamriel el juego te atrapa y crï¿½anme no puedes esperar el momento de regresar y seguir explorando este gigantesco mundo lleno de secretos y maravillas.  Cuando pienses en Oblivion, no imagines un juego tipo las Final Fantasy, o los tï¿½picos RPG's japoneses, este es un RPG que apela a un publico mucho mï¿½s amplio. Aquellos que gustan de juegos como zelda, o aventuras como Enclave, e incluso los fans de los juegos de sigilo como Splinter Cell, encontraran aquï¿½ algo para ellos.   Camino a la gloria  ----------------------  ES4: Oblivion te coloca en el Rol de un prisionero, que por alguna razï¿½n, fuiste parte de un sueï¿½o del Emperador Uriel Septim en el cual tu eras el elegido para salvar a Tamriel de un oscuro grupo Daedra conocido como Mythic Dawn. De esta forma empiezas a vagar por las catacumbas ayudando a los guardias a proteger al emperador, sin embargo el emperador es asesinado y tu eres la unica esperanza de detener a este culto y cerrar las puertas de Oblivion y asï¿½ detener la invasiï¿½n de los Daedra a Tamriel. Es en esta parte donde empiezas la personalizaciï¿½n de tu personaje, que habilidades deseas, cuales serï¿½n tus fortalezas y debilidades.  Dependiendo te tus elecciones, podrï¿½s ser un guerrero, un mago, un sigiloso ladron asi como pertenecer a cualquier raza que desees. Conforme avanza el juego debes ir haciendo crecer tus habilidades para poder ganar experiencia. ï¿½Como hacerlo? eso depende del tipo de personaje que escogiste, hay toda una gama de habilidades a desarrollar.   Empaca tus cosas  ---------------------  Oblivion posee infinidad de misiones a realizar (aproximadamente 500 horas de juego), claro esta, hay una misiï¿½n principal que es encontrar al heredero del emperador y cerrar la puertas de oblivion, sin embargo, si asï¿½ lo deseas, puedes ignorarla y tomar otras bï¿½squedas como unirte a la Hermandad de los magos ï¿½ a la de los Luchadores, pelear en la arena, ganar fama y fortuna o simplemente explorar y ayudar a los diferentes habitantes de Tamriel en sus vidas diarias. Cuando hablamos de juegos donde puedes hacer lo que quieras, ahora estaremos hablando de Oblivion.  El reino de Tamriel es enorme, hay muchas ciudades que visitar cada una tan diferente de la otra, los personajes parecen tener vida propia, sus problemas, discusiones, mitos, etc. Ademas de los pueblos encontraras infinidad de aldeas y mazmorras donde, explorï¿½ndolas, descubrirï¿½s toda clase de Items que te ayudarï¿½n completar las tareas que hayas escogido.   Lo bueno, lo malo y lo caro  -----------------------  En el apartado grafico Oblivion realmente te quita el aliento, los paisajes, las montaï¿½as los bosques son simplemente impresionantes. Los ï¿½rboles se mueven con el viento, igual que el follaje. Los atardeceres y amaneceres son simplemente espectaculares, esto agregado a que puedes explorar cualquier parte de este gigantesco mundo es lo que hace a Oblivion ser una experiencia sobrecogedora de principio a fin (si es que hay fin...).  Sin embargo un juego tan gigantesco como este no esta libre de problemas, de vez en cuento encontraras ciertos bugs, como tu caballo flotando misteriosamente sobre una roca, etc. sin embargo son nada ante lo que le juego ofrece.  Y lo caro, todo tiene un precio, si realmente quieres apreciar este juego en toda su magnificencia necesitas una PC relativamente potente. Aunque hay un parche para PC's no muy potentes.   Shut the Jaws of Oblivion!  ---------------------------  Oblivion es uno de los principales contendientes para juego del aï¿½o, asi que no te lo pierdas es un juego fantï¿½stico. Si estas pensando que hacer estas vacaciones te recomiendo un viaje a Tamriel y crï¿½anme serï¿½n unas vacaciones que nunca olvidaras...  
 QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS by Cassandra King is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It is poignant, uplifting, tear-jerking and insightful.  When I opened the book to the first page, my heart plummeted. First person point of view--not my favorite. I'd just finished another review book in first person that I most definitely did not like. Not only was this one in first person, but present tense--a double whammy. To say I started reading with a negative attitude in place would be a truism.  Then the story took over and I forgot about the point of view. While the present tense did occasionally intrude, the story was so well written that I couldn't count that against it. Like STEEL MAGNOLIAS and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, this is a story of the deep South, but it touches on themes that affect us all.  The story is set in a small Alabama coastal town and centers around Clare, a therapist who has her own problems. Clare, a widow, runs group sessions and retreats for women going through divorce. Her work is everything to her, even taking precedence over the two men who want her as more than just a friend. She can dish out advice, but when it comes to taking it herself, Clare has more than a few problems.  Full of quirky characters, QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS  will make you laugh and cry, cheer and boo, but most of all, it will make you keep reading to the very end. The story has a touch of romance and all the angst you can handle as you get a peek at the lives of the inhabitants of Fairhope. This one is definitely a keeper.

 These laminated maps are great.  They're durable and survive being toted around from pocket to bag to car to wherever.  I always get one for my travel destinations and wouldn't be without it.  This DC map has well-marked Metro stops and places of interest.  It packs as much as it can into its size 
 Richard Preston's The Cobra Event is a scary outlook on the possibility of biotechnological warfare. Though the book concludes without mass destruction, the issue it raises does not die as simply as with the spraying of bleach. It is quite easy ot believe that a book like this could scare President Clinton into forcing analysis on how plausible the issue is: in the current day, corporations and terrorism are extremely relevant.  I had some problems with the writing style in terms of the fact that it is a bit disjointed, but it gradually improved. Otherwise, it is descriptive and excellent 
 i loved..loved melissa's version of vampires. it comppletly blew my mind... she is a remarkable writer and this story was incredible. i am loooking forward to the sequel 
 Despite the complaints this is still a great album.  I have never listened to a soundtrack as much as this one.  Definitely see this show and buy this soundtrack.   
 In the era of Avian Flu, the First Horseman is a chilling tale. The reappearance of the 1918 Spanish Flu near a North Korean bioweapons facility causes alarms to go off in Washington. The hunt for a potential vaccine leads to an unlikely venue: an Arctic mining town where victims of the flu were buried in permafrost in 1918. These victims, provided they never thawed, would still have virus material in their lungs. These material could be harvested for use in a vaccine.  When American scientists finally reach the frozen town, they're startled to find an unsavory surprise awaits them. And things go downhill from there as an investigative journalist, the intelligence community, and other parties all race to get the vaccine before a biological attack is launched.  Yes, you've got predictable plot twists and the conventional, whoa-is-that-guy-psychotic criminal mastermind. And, true, you know how everything will turn out in the end. But in between, a fair amount of excellent research detail and some chilling analogs to today's world of H5N1-brand Avian Flu make Case's book both highly relevant and truly ominous 
 Okay, I am no expert on country music, but I do know is that country music is FULL of "recording artists".  By this I mean people who sing songs created by others and who are glammed up.  Travis Tritt, mullett and all, is a true artist.  He wrote the majority of the songs on this cd.  His performances in each selection bears his soul and his fun side.  This cd has the drinkin' songs and the ballads.  His other cds are quite good as well.  The remark from the Brit's review was far too abrasive.  How about saying something about content.  Let's not bring up british acts- like the Spice Girls 
 Excellent, dark Tricky and more rewarding than the solipsistic "Almost God."  If you really want to hear Tricky at his rawest and most intense, however, see if you can find a copy of "Live at the Paradiso" (in Amsterdam).  It has a bar code so it's not a bootleg, and if you like Tricky (and Martina) it will have your lower jaw sitting in your lap.  I've seen three copies at various places in my town, all used and selling at new-import prices.  Worth every penny, though, as is the staggeringly good "lost" Portishead album "Trip Hop Reconstruction" on the--surprise--Australian Trip Hop Reconstruction label.  I've got the only copy I've ever seen, but check the rare records sites, and pay whatever it takes 
 This book is fantastic - its illustrations are haunting and lovely, and the story is magical and historical at the same time.  Faith Ringgold's approach makes the history simpler for children to understand while not undermining the depth and horror of slavery in America.  I highly recommend it to any parent 
 I am completely knocked out by this DVD. There isn't much more I can cay about it - see the other reviews - except to say that if you're a fan of Baroque music and opera, you must have a look at this!  The cast is first rate and it would be hard to imagine better a better one. I have the old Gardiner / English Baroque Soloists / The Monteverdi Choir CD recording on ARCHIV, and whilst I enjoyed it, it never captivated me. I bought this DVD recording and expected to be entertained, but I am surprised how good this work is in the hands of William Christie and his Les Arts Florissants ensemble. The DVD is a revelation.  The cast is excellent, as I previously mentioned. William Shimell is a very manly and effective Hercules. Joyce Didonato is very beautiful as his wife Dejanira. She is also too sexy, in fact. Toby Spence just knocks me out. He was superb as Calisis in Rameau's Les Boréades, and he is great as Hyllus in this recording. So young, so talented! I hate him! ;-))  The choir and orchestra are in top form.   This is a wonderful and moving work.  
 Yet again, another solid release from what i consider to be one of the best labels (Naked Music)out there. The combination of Aya, Lisa Shaw and Jay Denes make this album a must have!  
 I have two Bohemes I cherish very highly: This one and the set with Bjrling and de los Angeles. Both are essential 
 Very good history of Earth First! before they got taken over by politically correct left coast weenies. Earth First! was very cool back in the day. They were very radical redneck hippies that drank beer, got laid, ate meat, smoked dope, in general they weren't opposed to hunting, were very politically incorrect and they got things done without compromise when mainstream conservation groups couldn't or wouldn't. Lots of interesting stuff on Dave Foreman and other well known Earth Firsters as well as other environmental groups and activists, plus info on the Judi Barr bombing as well as the FBI's methods of infiltration when they targetted Dave Foreman in their failed attempt to put him away. 
 Morality weighs on this album. Peter Tosh is the black equivalent of Michael Moore. Move over Tupac, Biggie Smalls, Marcus Garvey, Fred Hampton, and any other black leader (except for maybe Malcolm X) Peter Tosh had the most current and staunch and relevant voice for the scattered people of Afirca. I'd say that this album has a jazz feel to it. The photos in the remastered edition booklet are worth the price alone. Peter Tosh was all powerful. The influence of the album Mystic Man inspired me to quit drinking soda. Listen to this man, and see if he grows on you.   
 I bought this book, Essential Energy Balancing, unaware of the other books that Diane Stein had written.  As the author claimed, 'this is a book that changed my life'.  Diane Stein takes the reader, step by step, into a world  of understanding the forces involved in our present and past lives.  She  explains simply yet thoroughly how previous negative events and karma can  affect our present day consciousness, then she shows how to release the  negativity and 'balance' the energy processes of one's being.  Completely  enhancing.  She has a style that assumes nothing, and shows that she truly  is on a mission to help her readers heal 
 I really liked this book. Great characters and great descriptions of Lisboa, which is really an oft over-looked city. Sometimes, I admit, I had to keep at reading since he does, sometimes, get carried away but it was definitely worth keeping at it despite those small lapses leading to some excessive length. Personally I read quickly and like a longer novel versus something I can read in one airplane trip. A gripping tale and very interesting for the machinations and psychology involved in the complicated scenario. A really good writer and his other books are equally worthwhile 
 As others have said, some of the ideas in this book are very basic.  However, I see this book as more of a reference library addition than a means of learning out to run a retail store.    I can see a day when I open this book for a marketing idea and use it.    I purchased this book knowing full-well it hadn't gotten great reviews here.  
 This is a book that is a good starting place for those who want to know about Latin, but don't really have the need to master the language thoroughly.  There are many ways in which a familiarity with and appreciation of Latin can enhance one's facility with English as well as other languages, and this book by Richard Prior (not the comedian, whose name is spelled Pryor, but rather the professor from Furman University) provides an easy and engaging text to gain such.  That said, this is not a book for those who want to master the language.  This book could serve as a good secondary text for that purpose, but there are insufficient exercises, drills, and translation problems for this to be a stand-alone text for learning Latin beyond the very elementary level.  There are good vocabulary lists and a good glossary, and Prior's explanation of the different aspects of language (tense, mood, conjugation, declension, etc.) is worthwhile and helpful, but again, these are probably best used in connection with another text.    This book will probably be best for those who have already studied Latin in the past and are seeking a refresher course.  I think this is particularly true of the way that the verb conjugations are presented - for those who are not familiar with inflected languages, Prior's explanation will be helpful but not comprehensive; for those who have studied the multiple conjugation forms of Latin, it seems like a very small amount of coverage.  I freely confess a bias toward an arrangement that will have separate chapters and/or sections for different conjugations, which does not happen here (and the same is true for the different declensions of nouns), but I suspect this is more a product of my prior training (as opposed to Prior training) than any particular shortcoming of this text.  Particularly for those who intend to go into legal and medical professions (not just doctors and lawyers, but nurses, aides, paralegals, secretaries, and others who must master the terminology to work in and around such professions), this book would be a good, brief, accessible introduction to Latin.  For those who are going to become Latin scholars, this book will serve as a good secondary text along the way.

 This book preaches very good concepts that are good guidelines to follow if you plan on conducting a multi-developer PHP project.  It touches on many things such as coding standards, revision control with cvs, seperation of business and display logic using a template engine (smarty used as example), a brief discussion on object-oriented methodologies, and other useful development areas.  He cites many "futher readings" in context which I found extremely helpful.  All the examples in the book are very easy to understand and somewhat pertain to "real-world" situations (I found this a big plus since I don't like real abstract examples).   I have two complaints with the book (these are not THAT important and you should not buy this book just because of these two reasons.  The book is VERY good for most PHP developers).  1 - I don't consider this that "advanced" of a book.  I have been using this type of stuff for years now at my current work place -- although this would advanced for most "non-enterprise" developers (where teams are more than 5 or so).  2 - The lack of coding standard being used in the examples (something that he preaches about in one of the first chapters).  Other than those two complaints, this is great book for PHP developers looking to do stuff in a more "enterprise" way 
 Asks the interviewer, "What place would you give Shoot the Piano Player in relation to your other films?" Answers director François Truffaut, "No place. Simply the second film I made." Considering his first feature film was The Four Hundred Blows and his third was Jules et Jim, Truffaut's matter-of-factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile.   Shoot the Piano Player is worth smiles, too. It's a clever film, playful at times, even funny. More than anything, however, it defies categorization. The movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy, suspense and inevitability, tragedy and love, and gangsters, girl friends and violence. It's the story of Charlie Koller (Charles Aznavour), a piano player in a Paris dive, who used to be Eduoard Saroyan, a famous pianist, whose wife committed suicide. Truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man. Charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants. He can't go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing. He thinks about what he should do, but can't do it, and then circumstances take over. Charlie, thanks to his brothers, finds himself in a gangland underworld where double-crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow. Some say Shoot the Piano Player is an homage to American gangster films. Perhaps it is, but I challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie. The film is original, funny, moving and sad. It's the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about. All I know is that I was moved by Charlie. We leave him where we met him, playing piano in a Paris dive.  Charles Aznavour, a diminutive man with a hangdog look, plays Charlie perfectly. Aznavour is probably better known in the U. S. as a singer, but in France he's seen as both an actor and a singer. He's a minimalist, he says about himself. Charlie thinks too much and does too little. Aznavour lets us see into Charlie's soul with few words. It's a marvelous performance that left me saddened by Charlie, but liking him.  The Criterion DVD transfer is first-rate. Criterion gives us two discs. The first has the movie and a commentary track. The second disc contains interviews by Aznavour and Marie Dubois, who played Charlie's girlfriend, Lena, plus excerpts from documentaries featuring Truffaut, and other extras. The Criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and Truffaut 
 The absolute best book I've ever read. This book is easy to read and it's hard to set down. I've read a lot of self-help books but none have motovated me as much as this book 
 I haven't had this for about 3 years. It is such a great scent and the bottle is larger then I thought! Love it 
 This is one of the best, no-nonsense books on raising a son on the market today. I should know--I've tried alot of them! It's easy to read, thoughful and insightful 
 This was the break through record for Pink Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel 'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption. Now don't get me wrong I think this is a magnificent record but is it really Pink Floyd's greatest album, I tend to think not. Is it the greatest record of all time? Most certainly not. Because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great. Because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great, does not necessarily make it great. The problem with this record is that it sounds of its time, not that that's a bad thing, its just that it does not transcend time. The real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it. I can't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive. Some records released at the same time: Can's "Future Days"(1973); Nue!'s "2"(1973); King Crimson's "Larks' Tongues In Aspic"(1973); Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom"(1974); Tangerine Dream's "Phaedra"(1974) are by far more influential and enduring than Dark Side. If you don't own Dark Side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars, but make sure you buy 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' also. 'Piper' is Floyds greatest, most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time. Besides, how many people who think 'Dark Side' is Floyd's best have actually heard 'Piper'. 
 After the unrepeatable "Live in the Still of the Night" DVD, I thought that it would be hard to get another live album of the same quality.  But, I was wrong.  Whitesnake surprised us again with this double live CD that include most of the Whitesnake's hits.  I was glad to see that songs like "Slide it in", "Slow and Easy", and "Walking in the Shadow of Blues" were on a song list.  The reason I am rating this CD with 4 stars is that the sound quality was not as good as on the DVD, but it is still better than in the most live albums that are being produced.  I was curious to see how the new songs will sound.  Whitesnake fans were waiting new songs for a long time and I think that it was worth waiting that long.  Ready to Rock, If You want me and Dog are classic hard rocker tunes, while the All I want is You is a typical Coverdale's powerful balad. I think that Whitesnake gave us a small taste of what we should expect from their full studion album announced for this year. It tastes great...  If you are a fan of live rock albums then trust me - buy this one 
 i remember my older sister giving me this album when i was about three or four years old...a couple years after it came out and it has stayed with me ever since..i think we can all relate to the songs young or old..i remember singing along with linda ronstadt to i want a horse...or dancing with my sister to bluebery pie..these are great singers...this isnt barney or teletubbies...i wish more kids music was like this album..and i dont care if im 5, 25 or 65...ill cherish this album for the rest of my life..so that my children can experience it as well. 
 I love everything Chuck writes and this book is no exception.  I've been reading from other people's reviews that they think this novel is dull or boring.  I couldn't disagree with them more.    I felt that Chuck did a fine job of creating a reasonable eerieness and suspicion early on in the novel that he continued throughout.  This book seemed to be his frirst real 'mystery' novel.  It was a GREAT story.  So great a story in fact that I was considering trying my hand at a screenplay for the novel.  Anyone who says this wasn't one of his better novels needs to read other authors to realize that he is indeed one of the best novelists of our time. So even his 'bad' is better than MAAANY others' 'good' 
 ... as it is pointed in page 5, but with this book, you learn quicky AND easily. Although I do not own the whole "ridiculously simple"  series, I recomend the use of these books in the educative process 
 This is a good back up for any fan who has everything. Discs 1-3 has everything from Unknown Pleasures, Closer, Substance, Still and every demo inbetween that could be found. Disc 4 is collection of unreleased live tracks, which are probably some of the best live version ever done IMHO 
 this is a fun CD to listen to.  Not a lot of "serious" salsa here, quite a few novelty tunes, but they get your feet moving and your toes tapping.  You will enjoy listening to this CD 
 It gets a bit tiresome proclaiming each Super Furry Animals album their latest masterpiece that exceeds anything previous.  Many of their long time fans know full well that this band reached a new level of excellence with the album Rings Around The World and quite frankly, they haven't come down from that level one bit.  Phantom Power and now Love Kraft just further cement their place as one of the most consistently entertaining, creative and melodic bands on the planet.  Albums that came before Rings were outstanding as well but none of those previous works were as completely satisfying as their more recent works have been.    Love Kraft blends so many divergent sounds into one album that its hard to pinpoint any statement or word that sums up the album adequately.  They are true musical chameleons who smash up every influence they've ever had musically yet come out with something so utterly original and of their own that comparisons seem mute.  The one aspect of this album that comes across as refreshing is how each song winds up being different from one another while still adding up to a cohesive and satisfying album on whole.  From harmonica to strings, every form of sound possible in Pop Rock music is present for the listener and yet nothing is wasted.  Every instrument has its place and purpose among this musical soundscape.  Love Kraft will not win over many in the States, however, you have to give them credit for making an album that stays completely true to their roots while giving it a healthy go at appealing to the masses.  Most bands either lose the sound that made them what they are in trying to achieve this or continue to become more obscure in their approach forgetting that you still need to write songs.  The Horn, Ohio Heat, Frequency and Cloudberries definitely stand out so far as my favorites though that will surely change as I become more entrenched in it.  In fact, Frequency may just be one of the most beautiful tunes they've ever penned.  If your a fan who is familiar with their works this album will satisfy you completely, however, if your new to them you may be thrown off by the sound at first glance.  I would almost recommend a new listener get a copy of their singles collection Songbook, Vol.1 before diving into this one if only to sample everything they've done to this point.  It will make this album seem like the continuation of a linear creative process that it certainly is.  But, if your adventourous then I doubt you will be disappointed.  In the end Love Kraft may just be SFA's most uplifting album to date and the world neeeds as many albums like that as it can get.  Any year that a Super Furry Animals album comes out is a good one in my book and this one has already brightened my day just as their music has brightened my life ever since I first got Furry many years ago!  Do yourself a favor and get Furry too 
 I read this book because someone gave it to my mother while she was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. It changed my life. It is really not limited to breast cancer, it teaches women's health in general. There are lists of everyday foods in the back of the book as well as receipes that have really helped my physical symptoms. I would recommend it to ALL women 
 Stop your searching, grab your car keys, and head towards your local bookstore, or for you new high tech types head for amazon.com, because you must read James Howe's coolest book yet called The Misfits. The Misfits is defiantly one of those books you just absolutely have to classify as a classic. The story follows the seventh grade years of Bobby Goodspeed who is the all about lovable "fat kid" that everyone teases. Along with some of Bobby's close friends, he sets out on a quest, under the guidance of a some what pushy friend named Addie, to add a third party to the student council elections that will stand up for the so called, "minorities." After being called a very wide range of names about his "fat" Bobby dares to take the elections by storm, but as all you readers should know the unpopular kids don't always get the votes. No matter how good their campaign may be to win this election Bobby and his team will have to really give the students something to say wow about.  	Readers this book is a must read for gossip fans. Any one who was once a little kid in school always trying to stay on the "in" of who was doing what with whom. From the begging this book explodes into your mind with a very interesting twist of a start, not what you would expect for a book talking about a school election. The book keeps its potential as it adds a few unexpected little twist with characters personalities and emotions, but don't worry readers, Howe, who has written many children's books, keeps the story easy to follow. Everyone will love this story! After all I don't know how many people can resist a story about a fat kid, a tall smart kid, a 70's gagster kid, and the infamous misfit of the time, a gay kid.  	Readers Howe has really captured the troubles of being a teenager. Even if the characters are in the seventh grade, with the present times it won't be long until these problems really do hit home for the seventh grade era. When I was reading this book I really could relate it to the life of a high school freshmen, so don't be surprised, readers, if you too find yourself connecting to the plot. Readers over all I give James Howe's The Misfits four stars out of five. "Sticks and stones will break our bones, but names will break our spirits. 
 When Ace of Base burst onto the scene, the ABBA comparisons were obvious.  2 guys (mostly the creative force) and 2 girls (one blonde and one brunette who provide most of the vocals) from Sweden.  However, times had changed since ABBA.  ABBA's music was often either spanish-influenced (Fernando, Chiquitita), disco-oriented (Dancing Queen, Does Your Mother Know), or heavily dramatic (The Winner Takes it All, When All is Said and Done).  Ace of Base often fused reggae with the euro-dance sound of the early 90's.  Fusing these genres created an Ace of Base sound that was all their own and really nothing like what ABBA had done at all.  I owned both of Ace of Base's first 2 albums (The Sign and The Bridge) and enjoyed them immensely.  However, with over 1000 CD's in my collection, I started to thin out the heard where possible.  When this Greatest Hits collection was issued, I bought it to replace my other 2 CD's.  However, much to my chagrin, it did not include "Living in Danger" or "Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry".  I HATE it when record companies leave key tracks off of a Greatest Hits compilation.  I love the songs here, but if you are looking for a comprehensive collection that includes all of Ace of Base's US hits, this is not it.  You might try looking for the import version that does include those songs 
 I never really thought I would get into this book.  I just nonchalantly picked it up off of the bookshelf in the library.  I began to read it.  I was pulled in by the very real display of emotion, and the dialog was also  very realistic.  The characters were described so well, I could almost see  them.  The story line was also something that actually does happen.  Dogs  do get taken away because of destructive habits. As I read the story, It  felt like it was really winter outside, and I imagined myself sitting in  front of a warm fireplace, listening to it crackle, and drinking hot  chocolate.  Just like Fanny. I read the whole book in less than a day.  I  couldn't disconnect myself from it.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone 
 Detectives Duncan Kincaid of Scotland Yard and Gemma James of the Notting Hill Metropolitan Police are back in this eleventh outstanding entry in the series. Duncan and his live-in lover Gemma, and their respective sons take Christmas holiday with Duncan's family in Cheshire. It's a pretty little village with canals, cottage, and tragedy. On the eve of their arrival, Duncan's sister Juliet, who is a builder, finds a mummified body of an infant interred in the wall of the old diary barn that she is renovating. The story revolves around retired social worker, Annie Lebow, who after being burned out on one too many child service cases left her marriage to become one of the boat people that roam the waterways of England. Annie's past life as a social worker intersects with her new life with a dose of bad karma for Annie. In a parallel storyline, Duncan's sister's marriage is not only falling apart, but she has to deal with her trouble teenage daughter, and her husband's crooked business partner.   Duncan and Gemma take a bit of a back seat investigating the crime, but they are very much in the forefront on domestic issues in the story. This book has continued to flesh out their characters beyond their professional lives. Duncan's son Kit was very much a main character, as is his niece Lally. We got to see more of a father/son dynamic between Duncan and Kit. The book was richly atmospheric set in the bleak midwinter which suited the boat people/canal storyline. There were also flashback scenes narrated by the psychotic personality. I figured out who was narrating those scenes almost right away, but it didn't detract from the story in the least. I really did have trouble putting this book down which is always the sign of a good book. It might be helpful if some of the previous books have been read since each book builds upon the other in bringing the characters forward, but it is not absolutely necessary. This book stands as a fine stand-alone novel. Highly Recommended 
 Great Movie. Can watch it again and again, and still cry at the end 
 The 24th day, directed by Tony PIccirillo, explores the lives of two men, Tom (Scott Speedman) and Dan (James Mardsen) and how their one night encounter changes all their lives. This script is so well written the dialogue alone keeps you tense and wanting more. Speedman plays a man one the edge, driven by anger, hate, desperation and James Mardsen gives a terrific performance as a sexy, charismic man that is charming and boyish. These qualities from both actors mix so well that the sparring between the two brings about some tremendously moral debating. Responsibility, truth, honor, do they exist? The choices we make are our own, yet how does one live with the consequences. How well do we know our partners, husbands, wives, how safe is monogamy?  Piccirillo brings a raw, fierce and honest look at the actions that impact not only our lives but others. This movie is powerful and one you will want to own 
 If imitation is the sincerest form of flatterly, that expertly executed imitation must certainly be the most...flattering.  In this way, excellent flattery is what this book both promises and delivers in a big way.  After having read the Edwin Abbott Abbott book Flatland in 1962, ideas germinated in Ian Stewart's head for three decades before he took pen in hand and created, Flatterland...a sequel just as good as the original.  For those who don't know, Flatland is the 1884 story of square living in a flat society, Flatland, who comes to learn about higher dimensions, with his friend the sphere.  Set one hundred years later, Flatterland picks up the story with Victoria the line segment, Mr. Square's grand daughter, who re-visits high dimensions given modern understanding of what those higher dimensions are.  And even though some discussions contain pretty academic mathematical theory, on the whole, the book manages that unique accessibility and magic that comes when true understanding is combined with a great ability to communicate.  If all Stewart managed was to create a modern tour of physics and math touching on such diverse topics as how the universe came to be, whether we really do live in a "uni"verse,contemporary M brane theory, string theory and how other dimensions relate to all these issues, the book would merit five stars.  However, and to Stewart's credit, the book actually also touches on higher dimensions as a metaphor for overturning two dimensional ways of looking at things...just like the original.  If Abbott was around to read this book one can't help but think that he and Mr. Square would be very pleased indeed 
 Jacob's Travels describes what happened to Jacob when he ran away to Haran and met the lovely Rachel. It is part of the EKS Publishing series of Bible stories.  The author states in her introduction that she omitted some sentences and shortened others, but did not change or add any Hebrew text. Each page offers a translation, not necessarily literal, of the Hebrew. For example, the words in the story read: "Your name will be Israel because you have struggled with God and won." The literal translation at the end of the book says, "You will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and prevailed."  The layout serves its purpose although it's not particularly imaginative (text/picture repeated in double page spreads). The words of the text--first Hebrew and then English underneath--are printed in a clear font that will help children read more easily. Carol Racklin-Siegel, a textile artist who paints on silk, has used this medium to effectively enhance and extend the meaning of the text. Greengard and Racklin-Siegel have previously published other Bible stories with EKS: The Tower of Babel, Rebecca, Noah's Ark, and Lech Lecha. Let's hope they continue this superb partnership. Ages 5-7.  Reviewed by Anne Dubli 
 The Berenstain Bears and the Messy room by Stan berenstain is an exciting and hilarious book. My favorite part of this book is when brother bear fell down with the mess in his room. This book is an exciting and hilarious book. Ihope you read this book 
 Although it is written with children in mind, I'm a mother of two with very long hair and not much time to fix it. The ideas were great and the instructions were very easy to follow. These designs look cute on little girls, but look very sophisticated on women. Great book for beginners, or anyone looking for a few fresh ideas for braids 
 This book tells you many ways to improve your speed....What plyometrics you should do.....and soooo many ways to imrove yourself..ways which YOU wouldn't have thought of 
 A Very heart felt, feel good Christmas story.  With good moral teaching for all year.  I loved it and had to add it to my favorite selections 
 This is one of the best books I've read in a long time - I couldn't put it down.  It was so enthralling that immediately after I finished it, I had to read it again.  It's like experiencing "Silence of the Lambs" by olfactory senses.  Mr. Suskind has woven a fantastic web of a story here, keeping you captured with each page, and tops it off with a totally mind-bending, ghastly ending.  I highly recommend this book.  It was thoroughly and fiendishly enjoyable.  I can only hope once I'm able to view the movie, they do it justice.  But I promise you - once, you read "Perfume," you'll wonder how on earth a movie could be made with this story line 
 This is my all time favorite version of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow tale.  The cast is wonderful and the storyline is never dull.  I highly recommend this movie 
 On rehearing this famous 1962 recording, I was struck that it lacks the polish and orchestral unity of performances from Karajan, Colin Davis, and Bernstein. The Royal Philharmonic wasn't first-class, yet in this case the roughness in their playing--e.g., squawky oboes and punchy brass--adds to the ruggedness of Barbirolli's interpretation, which speaks of raw Nordic landscapes rather than polite concert halls.   As usual with him, Baarbirolli favors a great deal of shaping as tempos and phrases are guided by his intincts.  As an instictive conductor he definitely tuned in to Sibleius's idiom--everything feels right, and the faster-than-usual tempos add to a sense of immediacy and thrust. As for the sound, the engineers went for transparency over impact; the strings sound thin and a bit shrill at loud volume above th stave. By today's standards this once-spectacular recording sounds fairly ordinary. Altogether, I would rate this a very good Sibelius Second that could be a top choice if you want Sibelius rough-cut and raw 
 I'm currently in rehearsals for a production of "The Threepenny Opera" based on the Donmar Warehouse production, so I bought this CD to get an idea of the original.  I've heard bits and pieces of other productions, and something about this one struck me as distinctive and "right", but I could not pinpoint what.  Finally I realized:  The Donmar version has a distinct tone of "Englishness" -- or even specifically "London-ness" -- that all others lack.  The play is about poverty and gangs in London, and frankly, in the theater world you can't get much closer to that than being an actor in London.  The films tend to have a feeling of German-ness, and American productions have a feel of American Musical Theater, but this production seems to be by people who honestly know, and are the real products of, the world and environment depicted in the play.  This adds an extra note of authenticity, in addition to the return to Brecht and Weill's original nastiness 
 I have been into gourmet cooking for years. We live in Germany and vegetables here are not the same as in the U.S. Hence, we usually stay away from cookbooks made by American writers.  But THIS COOKBOOK IS WORTH EVERY CENT AND IS A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL HEALTHY VEGETABLE COOKBOOK for the homemaker and for chefs as well. It avoids red meat though not entirely low-fat nor vegetarian. The flavors are never the same for each recipe.  They are uncomplicated, have easy to purchase ingredients, but the resulting flavors are complex and exotic and best of all, healthy.  The vegetables are arranged by name and all the recipes from all over the world follow after each vegetable (how convenient for someone in a rush or for leftovers in the fridge!) and gives foreign equivalents of the name, descriptions, seasons, important science information on how to keep it fresh, how to detect the good ones from the bad ones, etc. for each and every vegetable. The format is in outline form which is so convenient. No lengthy, time-consuming paragraphs which I really hate.  It is NOW A VERY IMPORTANT MEMBER of my cookbook library. No fancy recipes with hard to get ingredients. For cuisines - there's European, Indian, Mediterranean, American, Asian, etc.  Wonderful, wonderful cookbook for everyone all over the world !  Dont think twice. Just buy it. I wont make this review if I had doubts 
 I was also impressed with this work.  It ties together many aspects of meditation and spirituality that I previously saw as separate, and got me many steps further down my own path.  Young relates difficult concepts with amazing clarity and insight drawn from his own experiences.  Born American, studying Buddhism as theology and then exploring Zen practice later in life, he brings an open and expansive view to the theory and practice of meditation.  He also brings to light the role of meditation in Christianity and a number of other religious traditions.  This is a great place to start your journey, or a good stopping place if you feel you still need to locate yourself within the larger tradition.  
 Rather, it is about obsession to destroy all that is meaningful.  The central character here is not the Jeremy Irons character, who is really more of a pawn, it is Juliete Binoche's Anna. Her embodiment of the role allows her unworldly, captivating presence to anchor the storyline; one does not even need to know how she was damaged to intuit it.  The other main character here is Binoche's dead brother; the origin of the sibling's destructive relationship is displayed through the character of Binoche's mother, Leslie Caron, who gives a brilliant performance appearing addled and unaware, yet anything but...she is the original damaged goods in this film  There are so many layers driving the finality. Louis Malle's direction leaves every subtlety before the audience. This is an example of the best art has to offer 
 While I am an Evangelical Protestant, I have enjoyed this book tremendously.  Often, when reading various passages, I felt that this book should be re-named "The Christian Way" because of the orthodox truths presented.  While this book is not a systematic theology of the Orthodox Christian Faith, it does expound on a lot of the beliefs held in common by all Christians and by orthodox Christianity.  The author discusses various ways of looking at God or understanding God: 1. God as Mystery 2. God as Trinity 3. God as Creator 4. God as Man 5. God as Spirit 6. God as Prayer Epilogue: God as Eternity Each chapter has descriptive sub-chapter titles, plenty of references, and ends with a compilation of sayings and words of wisdom.  A complete and extensive bibliography, list of authors, and subjects reflect the depth of Bishop Kallistos Ware's writing.  For those of you who may be intimidated by the word "Orthodox" in the title, I would mention that the style of Kallistos Ware is non-polemical, but rather padagogical and inspirational.  A great companion to this book would be the "Orthodox Church" by Timothy Ware (name before becoming bishop) or Daniel B. Clendenin two books on Easter Orthodoxy 
 This is a touching, beautifully written tale of an unusual family and the 15-year-old daughter, Tamara, who is forced to hold it together while her mother battles TB in a sanitarium and her artist father fails to cope. As someone who also moved many times as a child, and was often forced to care for younger siblings, I can fully relate to Tamara's feelings. It wasn't until I became a mother myself that I was able to gain some perspective and understand that most parents do what they are able to do in often impossible circumstances. You'll love this book and all of its humor, wit, style, and yes, tragedy. Take the time to read it. This tale will be one thing that stays 
 esta antologia realmente hace honor al legado de un grupo muy especial que quizas no tuvo el reconocimiento merecido. completa seleccion de temas, buen sonido, booklet digno, quizas el valor de esta edicion fue desdibujado cuando se edito el increible box set (songs of yesterday)....pero para aquellos que no crean conveniente gastar mucho dinero esta antologia es MUY BUENA y muestra suficiente de la inspiracion y crudeza de esta banda inolvidable 
 This is a must read for anyone who wants more out of life.  Wealth without a Job is one of the most financially beneficial books I have read in a long time.  It takes your psychology and puts it in a money building mindset.  The way I look at things now is more from a perspective of financial prosperity and gain instead of worrying about paying the bills or just catching up.  In fact since reading this book my business has picked up tons of steam and I have been on a roll ever since.  I would just like to thank Andy and Phil for writing this book.  This should have come out years ago.  Who knows where I would be now if I had it sooner.  
 Mrs.Piggle wiggle is  a very fantastic book.  They are naughty children.  For example, not taking baths and not sharing with people.  It's a good book because it shows how hard life is and how to make them listen to their parents.  The next reason us because they are a lot nicer. People will have a bunch more amazing friends.  Mrs.Piggle Wiggle also helps make them friendlier.  In conclusion these are some of the most spectacularly book there are 
 Wow, this CD is really worth the listen. It's typical Fiona, but the title track is truly amazing. I was totally feeling the "Judy Garland"-like channeling that Fiona musters with all of her mellow alto goodness! Good Times!! Some of the songs aren't really up to Fiona Apple's usual speed, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone with an appetite for something other than the boring mainstream hooplah.    
 I recently saw this movie on Lifetime movie network.  WOW!  This is one of the best movies that have ever seen.  This movie shows just what it would be like for a teen if they were to be a parent.  I was really surprised about the outcome, and I would explain more, but then you would not have any reason to watch it.  This movie showed how to be responsible for your actions, and that you need to think about what you are doing before you do it.  If you have ever had this type of situation happen in the family, or are expierencing it right now, I would suggest that you watch this film 
 Larry and I went to school together. We were close in Junior high, but drifted apart when he went into the military. He had mentioned the Bentwaters thing, but never went into too much detail. I knew a lot of guys  who went in the military relatively sane and came out messed up. After  reading his book, I was left with a fascinating insight as to what he went  through these past years. Regardless of how you feel about UFO's or the  government, you should read this book. Have patience, read the whole thing.  Then try to figure out why the rest of us just sit around and let things  like this happen while a certain very few contend with all the whacko's out  there to attempt to open the public's eyes. Sorry Larry, the rest of the  world prefers to stay sleeping 
 This book was impossible to put down.  Each chapter was like being given a puzzle piece to a beautiful painting. Well written and great research. A Classic 
 This book was very fascinating and fun to read. The book is very informative and interesting about the development of "the Bomb", and beyond. The book goes into vast detail about Ernest Lawrence, Robert Oppenheimer, and Edward Teller; especially Ernest Lawrence. The book starts in about 1939 with Ernest's invention of the cyclotron, and ends in the early 1960's with the Limited Test-Ban treaty. Besides talking about the relationships between the three physicists, which is very interesting, the book also talks about a lot of the small people involved in the production of the first fission weapon. What I think is cool, is the information given on Robert Oppenheimer from the FBI. The book also sends a lot of time discussing Edward Teller's interest and development of the Hydrogen Bomb. Although it does give some information about the nuclear testing we have done, it would be better if the Author discussed this more. Overall, I enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history and development of nuclear weapons 
 I bought this book because of the good name of the author at first.  He used great and clear Mathematics and diagrams to explain the theory and applications of the wavelet.  It is easy for graduate student to follow, I  feel.  And I kept this book as my faviour book in my bookself 
 Being my favorite book in the series, I have to say that it's absolutely amazing. Philip Pullman does a great job with putting a whole new character with his own past and personality into the sequel, and yet somehow connecting it with the original plot. What a clever guy! Besides, I really liked Will and his story, especially when he meets Lyra. The two go through so much together, exploring and traveling to other worlds with a new device, the SUBTLE KNIFE! Read how Lyra's and Will's relationship changes, and the adventures and obstacles they encounter while they go on a quest to find what they're looking for. You will love this book 
 One day we are told that fats are bad and that we must avoid them at all costs.  Next we are told that carbs are the enemy.  The experts cannot seem to make up their minds on which individual foods are good for you and which are bad.  If all else fails, they fall back on the need for "moderation".  Wouldn't it be nice if there were some really rock-solid nutritional research one could rely upon?  Wouldn't it be comforting if we had research more compelling than "Food X just might raise your blood cholesterol a bit, and if that happens you just might be at a slightly higher risk for getting heart disease?"  Unbeknownst to practically everyone, there is a body of nutritional research in which we can have great confidence.  Researchers can never carry out large-scaled controlled experiments on people but Weston Price did the next best thing and served as an eyewitness and recorder of nutritional experiments that tribes throughout the world had decided to undertake on their own.  Side by side were groups that maintained their traditional diets with those that adopted the modern commercial diet of the 1930's.  Price meticulously documented the results of these experiments and pinpointed the factors necessary for optimal health that were common to the successful traditional diets.  And how did Price judge the efficiency of the alternate approaches to nutrition, by use of weak biological markers?  No way, he focused on the incontrovertible results of dietary regimens, such as whether or not they supported the proper development of the dental arches (as opposed to causing crowded, crooked teeth or problems with one's bite), whether the diet conferred resistance to dental infection (or left one susceptible to the ravages of dental caries), and various other direct and significant measures of health and vitality.  And he documented all of this with photographs as well.  If this were the extent of his research, it would be astonishing and compelling, but Price went beyond this series of studies to find corroborating evidence in a great variety of other studies performed by scientists of his day.  He also verified his findings in studies of his own patients.  When taken in aggregate, one cannot help but be in awe of what he accomplished, a series of undertakings which come across as heroic and superhuman to this mortal.  Read this book and be a witness to a scientific study of unparalleled significance and scope 
 I howled reading this painfully accurate story of a wedding-band musician trying to maintain his rock and roll dreams when he's entering the age of Relaxed Fit. I give it a 9 only because I found the ending disappointing, but I have to say the description of the JFK assassination musical is worth the price of the book alone 
 James Patterson is one of my favorite writers and I greatly enjoyed this book. I highly recommend reading it 
 "8 Weeks to Optimum Health" is an excellent informative book with sensible ideas.  One of the points that he brings up is keeping the body at homeostasis, the purest and most healthiest period of one's life.  It is hard to believe that in eight weeks one can bring his body back to a healthy state.  And with Weil's suggestions for mental and physical well being you can continue to improve.  Though going through your pantry or fridge and throwing out probably most of what is in it may be hard, it is the first and hardest step to achieving good health.  It is also shocking to learn how bad oils and fats are for you.  Another very surprising part of the book is about the ways water is bad for you.  Clean water is essential for healthy living.  One adjustment that may be very hard to make is replacing meat with soy foods, which Weil claims to be healthier.  There are many healthy atlernatives to everyday diets and the book is filled with useful information.  The most useful, and probably easiest to adjust to is the customized plans that Weil lays out for different genders and age groups.  Weil also doesn't just preach healthy living but he gives excellent recipes at the end of the book to help one adjust and start being healthy.  It is a good read and a good resource to refer to when your health is in question 
 This book melded two things I never thought I'd see in one book.  The Salem Witch Trials and modern drug research.  Sounds a little weird at first, but Robin Cook makes it work.  Alot of mystery as well as some insight into the past of 17th century Salem, Ma make this a very engaging read.    As with other books by Robin Cook, none of the characters is perfect which always makes his creations easier to relate to, no matter how rich, smart, etc, they may be.  Great read! Very exciting endin 
 It's even on my wishlist. ;)  This is a fantastic book.  After I read my friend's hardback copy, I made him promise to leave it to me in his will since he wouldn't give it to me.  :D  "Golden Age" sci-fi at its best, with a little weird fantasy too 
 I bought this book of poetry because of a recommendation from a close author friend of mine. Since I bought "A shropshire lad," I have read it three times, highlighted my favorites and enjoyed every verse.  The great thing about Housman is that his rhyme scheme seems effortless. Whereas other poets seem to struggle and adjust a story to fit the rhyme, Housman's poems flow naturally and are lyrical. The subjects of his poems are very royal and I enjoy them a great deal.  If you are looking to enjoy some poetry that isn't hard to understand and is among the best ever written, I hihgly recommend "A Shropshire Lad." 
 "The moth don't care if the flame is real 'coz flame and moth got a sweetheart deal,  and nothing fuels a good flirtation  like need and anger and desperation." ~The Moth  Aimee Mann gives a great feel good concert with cool creative appeal. She gets you into a relaxing rhythmic groove and keeps you addicted right to the last song, then she gives you more.   The DVD reveals how Aimee Mann keeps her connection with the audience on a human level. She never seems distant and even defends her love of boxing. As we can now see, she gave her the next album she talks about twice, a different name.   Songs: The Moth, Calling It Quits, Sugarcoated, Going Through the Motions, Humpty Dumpty, Amateur, Wise Up, Save Me, Stupid Thing, Pavlov's Bell, Long Shot, 4th of July, Red Vines, Invisible Ink...and more. The DVD features interviews with the band and a slide show set to music.   I first heard "The Moth" on her Lost in Space album and loved seeing this song performed live. Her lyrics appeal to my analytical side and the moods are rich with atmospherics to leave me feeling dreamy. As she sings on a stage awash in a moonlight glow, you can't help wishing you had attended this concert.   ~The Rebecca Review  
 U.S. Diplomatic Security Agent Maggie Spencer receives an e-mail from an unknown addressee. One of the US' most wanted Nicholas Janssen can be caught if Maggie can get there soon enough. She has her doubts, but Maggie goes to the rendezvous point anyway, and makes the arrest.   U.S. Marshal Rob Dunnemore finds Maggie to learn more about the anonymous tip she received as the man she arrested almost killed him and several other agents in an ambush a few months ago. During his visit a diplomat is murdered, and Maggie and Rob join forces.   This is a novel written as only Carla Neggers could do.  It is intense to say the least.  It is a fast paced novel that starts rather quickly and never slows down until the dramatic conclusion. Mrs. Neggars' likeable characters struggle with the task of coping with their personals lives and trying to keep them seperate from work in a way any reader can relate to.  Her characters exhibit extrodinary personsalitites we all wish we had while being able to do a difficult job.  She is an amazing writer and her talents are obvious in this novel.  A must read 
 As a novice gardener I've perused a lot of books and usually they're either really wordy, use terms that a college professor might, or just don't quite have what I need.  This book is a really nice overview of everything related to indoor gardening, with lots of photos to explain what they're talking about or doing.  I especially love a photographic section on plant problems, diseases and bugs - a lot of the books out there 'explain' what to look for while this one actually shows an afflicted plant.  I recommend this book for anyone who's looking to get further into the indoor plants (without actually looking for a degree...) 
 I was born in 1984; I didn't even know who Oliver North was before I read this book.  But Dave Barry is so funny it's worth doing not-required-for-school research on public figures of the 80's simply for the payoff of getting his jokes about them.  And, of course, there are plenty of timeless inter-generational jokes about etch-a-sketches and boogers, too.  One reviewer said that this isn't really a "greatest hits" because it isn't excerpts from his other books.  That's because it's the "greatest hits" of his humorous newspaper column he wrote for the Miami Herald 
 Recently, I saw this brilliant show by the name of...Cabaret! Though it has been around for many years, I had no knowledge of it until a couple of months ago. Honestly, I went in fully expecting to be disappointed, but was I ever wrong!! I LOVED it! I went straight home after that and looked for the album. That's when I discovered that Alan Cumming was in a version of the play as my favorite character, the Emcee. EVEN BETTER! I love Alan Cumming--he is such a talented guy! I highly recommend this album! 
 This book, despite being written for children, is probably the world's most touching, sensitive, and well-written story about the loss of a pet.    When a little boy's cat dies, he struggles to come to terms with it and leans on his family and best friend for support.    By paying attention to the strory and its characters, a child can learn many important things about life.  The characters talk a little bit about what happens physically with death and how nobody really knows what happens after it, but that some people believe in an afterlife and others do not. Also, the characters speak about some of the good things surounding death......how the kitty being buried will help to make the flowers grow (again, it doesn't go into any gorey details with it), for example. The book ends with the little boy listing off ten of the good things which he will always reember about the kitty he lost, leaving the reader with the sense that he will never really be 'lost' at all. 
 This is a great book!  After having read it cover to cover a few times now, I feel very comfortable to tackle most of the plumbing work I am doing as I remodel my house.  It explains everything not only step by step, but also explains why, when and where different materials out perform eachother 
 Written over 20 years ago, "Space Station Seventh Grade" was author Jerry Spinelli's first published book.  Oddly, he had not originally envisioned it as being written for juveniles, but instead submitted it to publishers as being written for adults.  (The remnants of its adult's oriented writing can still be seen by the rather harsh language used throughout the book).  It was rejected by all adult publishers, however, almost by chance juvenile publishers embraced it.  Thus started the career of one finest authors of children's/young adult fiction.  "Space Station Seventh Grade" follows the first year of middle school for Jason Herkimer- a suburban Pennsylvanian everykid.  The book follows Jason from the sad end of summer to the terrors of middle school where 9th grade monsters prey upon 7th graders, where one has to take a shower after gym, where Home Economics is a subject, and where his teenage hormones start to wreak havoc upon him- creating pimples, making him act up and become a discipline problem, and making him go ga-ga for cheerleader Debbie Breen.  We are also introduced to Jason's homelife- he lives with his mother, his stepfather- Ham (who lives up to his name), his younger sister Mary, whom he can't stand, and his annoying young half-brother, Timmy.  Meanwhile, his father lives alone in a big city where he indulges in his passion for kosher food.  Jason also has an ecletic group of friends- fellow WASP Richie, Korean American Peter, African American Calvin, and Irish American Dugan.  Jason is also an avid, but not particularly gifted athlete, and his interests revolve around dinosaurs and space travel which has led him to build a giant model space station.  "Space Station Seventh Grade" contains many themes that have popped up again and again in Spinelli's other books- a love of athletics, interest in space, sibling antagonism, snow days, unrequited crushes, and the importance of individuality represented here by the character of Marceline McAllister.  Overall, "Space Station Seventh Grade" is an entertaining depiction of middle school life.  It's told with Spinelli's trademark humor which is one of the big reasons he has became such a success, and this book has some very funny parts.  However, it does contain a shocking "Bridge to Terabithia" moment with a supporting character meeting a tragic death.  It's aged fairly well- granted kids today may not know what a pocket football game looks like, but Spinelli wisely avoided references to pop culture which would have immediately dated his book.  However, if there is one criticism I have with Spinelli's portrayal of seventh grade is that he doesn't really touch upon the overwhelming peer pressure to conform and bullying that results when one doesn't that exists at that age.  When I look back on my school days, I now like to remember grade school as a halcyon time and high school as a lot of laughs, but I do not have any rose-colored views of my middle school years which I remember as just a horror show of kids viciously picking on each other over the stupidiest stuff!  Although Marceline is something of an outcast for her individualism, Jason seems remarkably untouched by any pressure to dress or act a certain way which is not how I remember middle school.         
 We have always heard about angels.  They are seen in churches, you find them in many homes and you especially see them as decorations around Christmas time. Angels 101 is an excellent tool for anyone who wants to know more about angels and how to work with them.  Angels certainly want to work with you, all we have to do is ask 
 Dostoevsky wrote that the true measure of a civilization can be found in the state of its prisons. Joseph Hallinan has unwittingly confirmed this, in his highly readable and excellently written travelogue of a self-confessed prison buff. We can perceive a country obsessed with material prosperity, technology, job-creation of any sort, and security. It matters not that we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world or that we have relinquished the goal of inmate rehabilitation in favor of simple warehousing. Hallinan points out that, after all, most inmates never had a loving home, decent education, or religious faith in the first place. Hallinan leaves us with the conclusion that he can offer us "no magic cures." This is obvious.  What is less obvious or excusable is his failure to employ his abundant familiarity with the problem to explore some areas for greater endeavor or, if not that, at least to provide chapter headings and an end of volume index to guide the reader as to his less ambitious thinking. 
 Background	 	I read Isaac's Storm, by Erik Larson, around 1998. Recently I had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review. Larson covered three killer hurricanes, two killer blizzards and one flash flood. 		 Galveston and related Hurricanes 	My first impression was that anyone who had read this book, about a major hurricane, would never consider riding out such a storm. Larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters.  Isaac Cline was the U. S. Weather Service Chief at Galveston at this time. This book gives much detail on the Galveston storm. This hit the island in September 1900, with very little warning. Indeed it was the arrogance of the U. S. Weather Service in general, and Issac Cline, their station chief for this area, in particular, that essentially preempted any warning. "Cline was one of the 'new men', a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms." First, the U. S. Weather Service refused to pay any attention to any inputs from Cuba. The U. S. Weather Service had men stationed in Cuba who "said the storm was nothing to worry about." Cuban's "own weather observers, who had pioneered hurricane detection, disagreed." Secondly the U. S. Weather Service insisted that, any storm warning had to come from the Washington office, with absolutely no exceptions. Finally Isaac had the conviction, and public position, that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. With such a position Cline had no motivation to try and influence headquarters.  	Larson cited two older hurricanes in his book.  * September 16, 1875 - "The storm raised an immense dome of water and shoved it through Indianola, pushing the waters of the Gulf and Matagorda Bay inland until for 20 miles the back country prairie was an open sea." This storm took 176 lives. * August 20, 1886 - This storm completed the destruction of Indianola. So many residents were killed that the survivors abandoned the town completely. 	In 1891, "in the wake of a tropical storm that Galveston weathered handily" Cline  was asked to appraise the city's vulnerability to extreme weather. Isaac wrote: "The opinion held by some - - - that Galveston at some time will be seriously damaged by some such disturbance is simply an absurd delusion." He made this statement in spite of the fact that the maximum elevation of Galveston Island, at that time, was an almost trivial 8.7 feet above sea level. He made it also in spite of the two killer hurricanes hitting and destroying the town of Indianola, about 150 miles southwest of Galveston on Matagorda Bay. 	Cline had a "model" of Gulf hurricanes, namely that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. His "model" of these storms was clearly fatally flawed, or politically influenced, and it resulted in 6,000 to 10,000 deaths.  	Larson suggests there was a "scent of boosterism" behind this article, and that he was writing an article that Galveston promoters would be happy to see. Could this have been a harbinger of things to come? Could Cline have been the first government weather scientist to prostitute himself by writing favorable papers on the weather for his sponsors? 	Then the storm hit. Both the U. S. Weather Service and Isaac Cline looked very arrogant before the storm, and also in defending their overall performance, after the storm.  Other extreme weather events  	Larson also covered two blizzards and one flash flood in his book in this book. * Hail and flash flood, August 1885 - "a severe downpour near San Angelo, including hailstones the size of ostrich eggs, killed hundreds of cattle and created a flash flood with An escarpment of water that Isaac estimated to be 15 or 20 feet high." * Blizzard, November 1888 - this surprise blizzard destroyed 150 vessels off New England, and caused the death of 450. * Blizzard, January 1899 - "this blizzard swept much of the South. Icebergs 10 feet high flowed down the Mississippi past New Orleans." This storm even hit Galveston and piled snow on it's beaches and drove water out of the Bay into the Gulf exposing portions of the bay bottom.  Conclusion 	Isaac's Storm shows the incredoble wrath of hurricanes, 105 to 125  years ago. It also depicts the incredible spectrum of extreme weather events, also of the same vintage. All in all a most interesting and rewarding book, one that I would recommend highly. 
 The remake of the 1975 horror classic was one of the best comedy/horror films to date. Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Bette Midler, etc. was great in their respective roles. For those who need a laugh and at the same time get scared half to death, I recommend this film 
 I used this as one of my required texts for my microbiology class in med school.  It had very good sections on parasitology, viruses, etc.  It was fun learning the what parasites are endemic to certain regions of the world and what symptoms they cause.  I was used the following: Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick Leonardi.  This second book was great because it was thorough in the aspects of test preparation in these various ways: it helped me prepare for the type of questions asked by my microbiology professor.  In this way when I was studying I knew which facts to study harder and to know better.  I easily got in the top 1% of my medical microbiology in grades with the help of these two books.  I give each book five stars 
 I have to say reading the comment above made me pretty sad. This book was not sending mixed messages and it is definately NOT telling you to be popular and that your parents will only love you more if you get good grades. This book is simply about helping yourself become more of what you want and getting more out of the life you were delt with. It makes me so sad to hear bad things about this book becuase that review probably stopped someone from buying this amazing book.   This book helped me through the toughest times in my life, it works with you and helps you see what is behind the "my life is perfect" mask that so many teens have. Amazing book, it changed who I am and how I act. For instance, in one chapter it talks about how in arguments if you just talk even if someone is yelling at you, you are not being passive, but in turn arguments turn into talks a lot more often. So as a test i followed this advice becuase i had just moved in with a step-sister my own age and we were not getting along very well. Now, that we stopped fighting (and i give all credit to this book) we are able to talk about what is bothering us and not fight. We couldnt be closer now. And that is exactally the reason i would recommend this book to ANYONE, it helps with topics like that without barking orders or telling you what you need to do or you suck as was stated above. This is an EXCELLENT book. BEST BOOK I EVER READ!!!! 
 I love this story. Echo lodge was great. It was about the last book where Anne is in Avonlea and a little girl. Very excellent book 
 This is the third autobiographic novel of the life of McCourt, and because it deals with the mind and attitudes and language of the young adult, it succeeds in many of the ways which earned "Angela's Ashes" the Pulitzer Prize.  In the life of McCourt, "Teacher Man" follows "`Tis"  which follows "Angela's Ashes."  All were written after he retired as a teacher.  "Angela's Ashes" was exemplary in its ability to look at things in the perspective of a young man. McCourt's ability to show impressionable insight amid the squander and pallor of the Irish slum was both bitter sweet and amazing.  Delivering such childlike tales literally 40 or more years after the actual incidents, and after having his own mind calloused with age and cynicism, was the wonder of his first novel.  "`Tis" was not as wonderful as it dealt with adult minds, with adult issues and missed that wanderlust perspective which adorned "Angela's Ashes." But, "Teacher Man" returns to the child - young adult at least - and provides us with the perspective of a young teacher amid young students in a very rough New York school. Truthfully, it was a match made only in America - McCourt never attended high school - let alone an American high school - and was placed in charge of an American high school class within moments of finishing university.  The book can be described as a calling out by teachers.  It could be recommended reading for teachers.  It could be an instructional book for teachers.  "Those who can't do, teach." "Those who can't teach, teach teachers."  Unfortunately, university professors have probably never encountered the shenanigans within a high school classroom, and their curriculum reflects such ignorance as they do not specify precisely how to discipline the chaos which so often arises within the schools' walls. McCourt's "Teacher Man" may be a response to such an academic vacuum.  In the meantime, he will tour America and Europe, and may even be invited as a guest on a late night talk show. Imagine that - a teacher on a talk show 
 Great up until the end. Even the end, indeed was very good, huge twist, massive climax; but the writers were blinded by their own prejudices, and wrote it wrong.   Basically, the script was fine, except for who had the lines. If you have the last fifteen minutes of the film, with Derrick and Beau reading each other's lines; the film makes moral and physical sense. It sticks to the point, that gossip is dangerous, and also, bad. And also, you'd have an ironic enlightening enlightenment at the end, what with Cathy and Travis being forced to come forward, and fight through an image of hypocracy that would be forced upon them, due to their actions.   The writers could then have ended the film with a whole righting of wrongs, especially the wrongs of the past. Seeing as the film was largely about digging up the secret past, to discover the truth that is affecting the present, it would have been fitting that the past could have been laid to rest. As the ending currently stands, Cathy and Travis seem to get off scot free, appearing to be angels, while the Truth of the past is still uncertain, as is that of the present, Derrick takes the fall for the second time, although it's not clear if this is or not, simply his second victimisation, and Beau, and Joshua Jackson go unchecked to the finale, maintaining the victim status that, at the outset of the film, is set up to be questioned, due to the character of their characters.   All in all, fantastic characters, fantastic direction, fantastic locations, shots, music, art, fan-bloody-tastic.   But the writers ballsed up the script!!!   Meh, no matter, whenever I watch the film, I just pretend that all the emotion is the same, but that it's all the other way round.   Sort of like watching Cruel Intentions, which is all about INTENTIONS, and feeling cheated when Sebastian gets hit by a car. HIT BY A CAR. WHY OH WHY wasn't he MURDERED? THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE. Murdered by anyone, Kathryn, the black dude, the mother of Cecile. Hit by a car is bloody lame, and pointless, completely devoid of INTENTION of any kind. And that's the way Gossip went.   Anyway, for those of you who don't mind having to stop watching cruel intentions just before Sebastian is killed, you won't mind having to imagine the ending to Gossip in a different way.   
 Peterson's book is illustrated with high quality color photograhs that show the reader exactly how to prepare a wide variety of meals using basic methods that professional chefs routinely use. This is not a cookbook per se; rather an excellent technique of cooking book for meats, fish and vegetables. Great book for a new or experienced cook 
 I bought the yoga booty ballet complete set and absolutely love it. It is fun, motivating and gives you a good workout. 
 Nice appetizer for those looking for an intro to the Beat.  Fun to listen to, just wish it had a few more tracks 
 This book is a collection of newspaper columns and journal entries that Friedman wrote before and after the September 11th attacks.  Friedman is very familiar with the Middle East, having been a news correspondent in Beirut and Jerusalem for ten years before becoming foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times.  Although he himself had stressed that one consequence of globalization has been the creation of super-empowered individuals with a grudge against the United States, and that bin Laden was just such an individual (The Lexus and the Olive Tree), even Friedman did not see it coming on September 11th, 2001.  This book features reprints of Friedman's columns analyzing the reasons why the September 11th attacks happened, and the reaction in the following months throughout the Islamic world.  The book also includes a short journal section, in which Friedman describes his travels in the Middle East while he was collecting material for his columns.  The events of September 11th 2001 found me and my husband in a Lebanese restaurant in the Dubai neighborhood where we had been living for four years.  The waiters were listening to the radio, and from all the cheers and excitement, we thought some Arab country was winning a World Cup soccer match against a European powerhouse.  But the waiters wouldn't look at us.  Finally one came over and with a face that alternated between embarrassment, concern, and glee, told us something big had happened in the U.S.  We went home immediately to check the news on CNN.  The following day, Western-educated Arab colleagues would give us their condolences, but not long afterwards, every one of them told us they believed the CIA and Mossad were behind the attacks, and that no Arabs were involved.  Bin Laden's face appeared on the wallpaper of my Emirati students' computers and cell phones-for them he was clearly a hero, not a demon.  In seeking to understand the events, I read the newspaper daily, and was amazed that Friedman, with a New York byline, could be so well informed about what we were seeing all around us.  While I don't agree with everything that Friedman espouses in this book, I think his analysis of the Muslim world following September 11th is about as accurate as any Western journalist could develop.  Friedman is a fierce patriot, for all the right reasons.  He lived overseas long enough to appreciate the qualities that make America great.  He reminds us that "American power and wealth flow directly from a deep spiritual source-a spirit of respect for the individual, a spirit of tolerance for differences of faith or politics, a respect for freedom of thought as the necessary foundation for all creativity, and a spirit of unity that encompasses all kinds of differences...Lord knows, ours is hardly a perfect country.  Many times we have deviated from the American spirit or applied it selfishly. But it is because we come back to this spirit more times than not, in more communities than not, that our country remains both strong and renewable." Friedman notes, "It will be a tragedy if Arabs and Muslims adopt the position that there is no conceivable reason why Americans might be upset with them today and that any criticism they face in the U.S. media is entirely the result of some Jewish campaign of vilification....Whenever a people reduces all its problems to a conspiracy by someone else, it absolves itself and its leaders of any responsibility for its predicament-and any need for self-examination...  No civilization has ever prospered with that approach...Only in a society that embraces self-criticism can the political process produce real facts to cope with real problems....The standard view of America in the Arab-Muslim world is that America is rich and powerful because it is crass and materialistic...The truth is exactly the opposite.  America is successful and wealthy because of its values, not despite them.  It is prosperous because of the way it respects freedom, individualism, and women's rights and the way it nurtures creativity and experimentation."  According to Friedman, although Arabs will point to US support for Israel as the reason behind the anger against the US, the real reasons for Arab anger come down to stagnating domestic Arab economies and hard-line autocratic governments which permit anger to be expressed only about the occupation of Palestine.  He notes how governments support hate-mongering imams, and how the Arabic media presents images of Israeli violence unceasingly on television. Thus, even those who are not drawn to religious institutions are kept perpetually angry, but their anger is safely diverted from domestic issues.  In an October, 2001 column, Friedman points out "Since September 11, the President of the United States has given several speeches about how Islam is a tolerant religion, with no core hostility to the West.  But the leader of Saudi Arabia, the keeper of the Muslim holy places, hasn't given one."    In trying to understand the deeper message of 9/11, Friedman writes "while the world is being globalized, shrunk, and tied together ever more closely in technological terms, this has not been accompanied by a better mutual understanding between cultures, countries and civilizations. There is a mismatch.  We are technologically closer-and culturally and politically as far apart as ever, at least among certain communities."  In one of my favorite columns of the book, "Changing the Channel," Friedman presents a tongue-in-cheek analysis of why watching the Golf Channel is a lot more fun than watching the news from the Middle East.  When I returned home from the Middle East myself, my first inclination was to wall myself off from news about the region because it made me angry.  But Friedman argues this is counter-productive.  "In the long term, the only answer is to figure out ways to change the attitudes and intentions of the people on the other side of the wall, or at least narrow the gap between differing cultures and political traditions so we can share this shrinking planet." That's a challenging undertaking 
 Very entertaining but alittle scary for little ones.  I would view with your child and explain certain situations.  My 7 year old son enjoyed it 
 My kids love Highlights! It's applicable to both of their age ranges (6 and 9) and is a valuable investment for any parent. I don't know what I would do without this magazine; it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car. Not to mention, it's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months.  
 I would recommend this as a reference source and buying it. It contains very useful information in many areas, such as endocrine problems and yeast etc. I have a few reservations. It only dedicates 5 lines to toxicity and detoxification, which more or less tell you to buy someone else's book. For one of the major contributary factors of Chronic Fatigue in many people, this is not really acceptable. If you are going to write a book about CFS, you can't just leave out key factors. My other reservations about the book are that it tends to mention many rather severe treatments and pharmaceutical drugs where these should only really be used as a last resort if at all, as many natural equivalents are just as effective (e.g. candida control etc). Lastly, the book doesn't clearly differentiate enough between what the reader should do by themselves, and what they should leave to a specialist to really prescribe the right treatment for them. It reads like a list of supplements. Apart from that, it is quite good. A useful overview of CFS, including toxicity, can be found at health-spy dot com 
 Dining with Friends is an impressive offering from Friends of Animals, a vegan activist organization. The book begins with a forward from John Robbins, and while it's written and edited by the president and legal director of the organization, there are contributions from chefs around the country.   The book is divided by courses. It includes a section on "Raw Delights" as well as remakes of classic animal-flesh meals (The Tempeh London-Broil is savory and delicious). The soup section is robust and includes The Creamy Lima Bean Soup by Chef Ron Pickarski--which has an unusual fresh flavor highlighted by the ground coriander.   Throughout the book, there are short essays about ingredients and techniques that make it a fun read for folks like me who read cookbooks like novels (cover to cover) before ever trying out a recipe. There's a glossary and a key to ingredients, nutrients which make the book accessible to new cooks as well as more experienced vegetarians.   The layout is glossy and clean and includes lots of enticing full-color pictures. The recipes are short and easy to follow. There's no nutritional information included with the recipes, and (ack!) no index. Despite these technical issures, I think this book would make a great gift to a new or long-time vegetarian. It's full of new and delicious recipes that are easy to make and easier to enjoy. --Amy O'Neill Houck  
 i gotta give this gun 5 stars because for 100$ its a remarkable gun. It definitely doesn't shoot 330 fps, more like 270-280 which is pretty impressive for the price. if you do buy the gun i would reccomend getting a classic army clip because the one it comes with is cheap and made out of plastic. Its got a nice rate of fire and great accuracy, just don't try to snipe anybody out. I don't think it can be compared to classic Army, but definitely as good as tokyo marui (better than utg).  
   My journey of self discovery has come in bits and pieces. A puzzle. I've been trying to make some sense of it all and Refuse to Chose has helped me do that. Thank you, Barbara Sher. I thought I was crazy. But reading your book has me believing that I'm some kind of genius. This makes my Afro curl even tighter! I knew it! I knew that there was something wired in me that was different but a good different not a bad different that others would had me believing. I will add RTC to my collection of other treasured "bread crumbs" that will lead me to doorsteps of the place I'll call home-My Best Work. 
 I singled out this book as I felt I'd come to a fork in the road of my life. I could choose to be bitter after the premature birth and death of my son or I could try to seek out better ways to live my now very different life. I started this book dubious of its content. I expected to be lectured. Instead I found myself reading with an open mouth; shocked at how accurately my loss was explained. It was as if this wonderfully gifted rabbi had invisibly witnessed the events of my life, the times when my relatives would say the dumbest and most cruel comments. Instead of being talked at, I found I was reading a book a kind friend had written just for me. I am not religious or spiritual, I guess you could say I'm confused, however his book has opened my eyes to a different, kinder religion than the one I had always felt was judgemental.   I have since purchased the anniversary edition and this book will be one of my most treasured possessions. If you feel life has let you down, if you feel every door that was once open has been slammed in your face, if you feel alone in your sorrow and have nowhere else to turn for relief, this book is for you. It won't make the pain go away, but it will make the pain and sorrow less personal. You will no longer feel `why me', you will just realize that it is what it is and that in itself will make your pain easier to cope with. This is certainly how I feel upon it's ending, I hope you experience the same comforts 
 This is my first review at Amazon ever, and that's just because i love this album. It's so trong and emotional, makes me laugh and cry. It's just so beautiful! The performance is very genuine, they seemed to have a good  time that evening in Japan. I like this recoding better then the studio  recordings 
 This is a great book that provides a solid supplemant to a college text book.  It is highly recommended by instructors but not considered a compulsory purchase in order to keep the price of textbook purchases down.  It's an invaluable resource that only gets better with each new edition.  If you want to get the edge in verb conjugation, this is the book that will provide you with the upper hand 
 I gave this book to my parents several years ago and still leaf slowly through its pages whenever visiting their home in northern Minnesota. For amateurs and professionals alike, his is a fascinating photographic concept: your own property? a favorite park? your family?  or pet? a holiday 
 This book provides a tremendous amount of information on sketching in nature but don't let the title fool you- this is a terrific general sketching and drawing book. Johnson covers topics that are rarely covered in other books. The use of pens, watercolors, pencils and colored pencils (both water soluble and not) are covered. This is an invaluable book and is an asset to both the beginner and more advanced student. I'm on Amazon right now trying to find other books by Cathy Johnson- I'm that impressed 
 I just returned from driving thru Belize for 7 days and this map was indispensable.  We put over 400 miles on our car and never got lost.  It was pretty current with the highway system (such that it is) in Belize and it held up pretty good.  I would only question the use of the term "main road" vs "secondary road" and "seasonal road" as most other roads other than highway are dirt roads.  And all the dirt roads looked seasonal 
 A very  nice coverage of various  topics in C++ are  presented in this book. The  chapter on templates could  be best described  as a summary for Josuttis  and Vandervoorde book  on C++ Templates  and Aexanderscu Modern C++ design with enough practical examples. Templates could be a complicated topic in C++, but Eckle and Alison present the topic in an easy to understand manner.  The coverage  of design patterns  is also very interesting  and loaded with very useful examples. Of course not all patterns are covered, but those  which the authors  cover do  so excellently.   Covered patterns include   Command,   Strategy,   Visitory,  Singleton   (very   clever implementations), Observer, Visitor, Proxy, and perhaps more.  No C++ programmer  should discard this book. It's  really very rich in examples,  unusual  advanced techniques,  and  plenty  of wisdom.  The advanced C++  programmer does not need  Volume 1 of the  book to enjoy this one 
 This book has some hidden jewels in it.  Col Hammes does an outstanding job of summarizing insurgent warfare history from Mao to OEF/OIF.  He writes a very good analysis of insurgent characteristics, and how, if done correctly, their messages will differ depending on their audience.  Unfortunately, this theory also applies very well to tyrants.  (The relationship between insurgency and tyranny is a great topic of discussion in its own right, by the way.)  He also makes valid points about the likelihood of future threats and some good ideas about restructuring the DoD.  Unfortunately, the present DoD is both a child of our political system (maintaining much of its DNA) and an organic growth out of wartime necessity (one of his favorite theories, "chaos theory," could be easily used to describe the DoD's evolution).  Such a huge change would require a group of incredibly strong leaders to find themselves at the highest positions of government at the same time, a proposition only slightly easier than getting the Founding Fathers together back in the late 1700s.  Hammes' weakest point is his main one:  his "generational" model of war has too many holes.  He tries too hard to make history fit into his mental model.  I prefer the concept of "levels" of warfare that forces can engage in, depending on their objectives/strengths/weaknesses and that of the enemy.  At the end of the book, he contradicts himself by saying that the generations speed up in their evolution, and then says that 4GW has been going on for several decades, so we must be entering 5GW.  Why not 6GW?  Why can't the interations vary in their intervals?  Maybe subnational insurgency was 4GW, while trans-national insurgency in the al-Qaeda mold is really 5GW.  The point is, it's not the model that's important here.  Hammes does makes a poweful case for the effectiveness of human-networked warfare (as opposed to computer-based or net-war), and he gives a good glimpse as to how to structure our national assets to counter this threat.  I would have liked to hear his thoughts on the possibility of a future sub-national insurgency inside the U.S. centering on the fast-growing hispanic population (both legal and illegal), but I'll take what I can get.  Overall, a great read with some real jems inside.  I highly recommend it.  Just don't swallow it hook, line and sinker 
 Some think Waiting for Godot is an argument for existentialism. Others believe it is about man's eternal struggle for the answer to the ultimate question. Neither seem correct.  In short, this is a play for those who prefer to strip everything down to the most basic form of language, to strip life down to a mere game of waiting. That is, in essence, what this is all about. We have two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who both wait for a man who may or may not ever show up. They don't know why. They don't know exactly when he will be there. Still they wait, eternally, by the tree, by wherever they think he said he would show.  This isn't an absurdist play, although it has been labeled as such. Absurdism, though, seems such an insulting way of labeling such a masterpiece. We oftentimes go thorugh our readings with the idea that everything has to be complex, that there has to be a theme placed deep within a convoluted story, but with Waiting for Godot, we have a simple theme: waiting.  The two characters symbolize nothing. They are, quite simply, not waiting to be analyzed. They become, in effect, victims of Samuel Beckett's own game: they are his quotation, and he only says what needed to be said at the time, and so he wrote it, whether people would catch on or not, whether they would label it absurdism or not.  If you were to take every line of this play and utter it aloud, very slowly, word by word like a robot in a very monotone fashion, you would probably capture the idea. If it's any indication, he wrote everything in French first--his second language--and then translated it in to English, just so it can be simple. I don't assume, of course, that this work should be cherished simply because it's an exercise in simplicity. But I submit that it should be cherished because it's a genuine, themeless--somehow--masterpiece about two people waiting for the most unimportant, unknown thing that may or may not ever come. It is frequently hilarious and constantly frivolous, but somehow, it manages to charm. It is like one of those songs that you can listen to over and over again, and it has no lyrics, and no meaning--as far as you know--but it still makes you feel good under glaring adversity 
 This poet changed my life. This poet had style, made his own breaks (luck), had great friends because he gave a damn about them, and loved art unconditionally in any form but with a special love for the city, for the life and art and noise (music) of the city. This poet wore a tie and jacket and swiveled out the door of the Museum of Modern Art with more hip in his pocket than you, Bro. This poet was gay and and every man considered him their best friend and every woman wanted to sleep with him. This poet grew up near Boston, went to the Navy and Hafvard and spent a year in Ann Arbor but was New York all the way, the very heart and soul of New York and the New York School of poets. This poet extends the line from Keats to Rimbaud into the American future 
 Keep in mind this is an atlas. There is no text explaining anything (the only text is labels on the pictures). The pictures are fabulous, and this is very useful for an anatomy course. I couldn't get through the class without it, it is very helpful. I highly recommend it. Just, make sure you take good notes in class if you're more of a text person than a picture person 
 the escalator and the man stand at the bottom summed up the album even before i had the pleasure of listening to such beauty and intelligence in my entire life time of listening to folk rock music this has affected me the most i can't tell how much..  i know it's an clinche but.it left me speechless i didn't know whether to cry jump up and down with merriment of..just sit quietly and seep in the beauty i had just been laid next too me.  all them emotions from a voice guitar and a trumpet at the end of broken arrows   how do you say can that happen? because this guy has talent. to transmit an beauty and vibrance over to the listeners ears  in my mind you have to be in tune with yourself to fully appreciate the album.    we all have these emotions in us to appreciate this album  on another level and i have and i won't be turning back it changed my life this afternoon.. the escalator only goes up..     
 This book has been a great tool in my genealogy research materials 
 Back in around 97 or 98, I was crazy about these two guys in a movie and started setting up funny situations in a roleplay where one guy would use idioms and the other would take them all literally. I was sooo happy to find this book to use as an idiom reference!!! I tried a couple of other idiom books, but this one is by far the best! ^_^ So warm and friendly, and I luv the cartoon kids who host the thing :) I am totally hooked on this book! ^_^ Buy it, BUY IT!! 
 My nieces (8, 2 and 1 y/o) and I watch this movie everytime we get together.  There are some moments in the movie that are meant for entertaining the adults who watch these movies with their children.  But the humor is just that...adult...and way over the children's heads.  If you are worried about the movie get it and watch it first.  Then decide if it is appropriate for your children.  We love it 
 I am a child abuse investigator and I am constantly seeking new information and also resources to share with clients and co-workers.  This book is great for teenagers to read as well as their parents.  It has given me more tools to use and reminded me of factors related to sexual abuse that help kids to recover.  I recommend that parents of child who are abused or even adults with past issues read this book.  I bought three of them!  Bonnie Sorli 
 "A Midnight Clear" is far more truthful and thought provoking than other movies that manipulate ("Saving Private Ryan") or outright lie ("Blackhawk Down") to make their point.  From Page 11 of the William Wharton novel on which the movie is based:  "When I say lost, I mean killed.  Nobody in the army ever admits someone on our side is killed.  They're either lost, like Christopher Robin; hit, as in a batter hit by a pitched ball, take your base, or they get 'it,' as in a hide-and-seek, or, maybe, 'get it,' as with an ambiguous joke."  These lines are just about identical to naration in the movie.    Will Wharton served in US Army Intelligence in WW II.  He moved to France after the horrors of WW II and he became disenchanted with American life.  "A Midnight Clear," while fiction, is also autobiographical.  To suggest that it is "unrealistic" is just false.  The man wrote (and the movie depicts) much of what the man experienced!  (His book "Franky Furbo" explores some of the same fiction and biographical themes but in a far more fantastical way.)  As a former US Army Intelligence Analyst myself (1980s) I have to say that this is probably the best military movie I've ever seen.  It shows both how naive the young intel soldiers are and how brutal the Army can be when dealing with those who even remotely challenge the system.  In the end it shows the futility of it all - not just war, but also the actions of the intel unit that thought it could live a different life than what the Army wanted for them.  I can see why the rah-rah types might hate this movie.  It challenges the status quo, the idea of the "good war" and the whole "suck it up and deal with it" military attitude.  This doesn't make the movie and book unrealistic.  Rather, it is dangerous to those who want to paint a different kind of picture of what war is like 
 Harold and Maude is simply the most joyful movie I have ever seen. Not only is it laugh-out-loud funny, it is touching and moving and odd. If you haven't seen it in a while ... see it again 
 "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is the most cinematic martial arts movie yet, as good or better than some of Kurosowa's Japanese samurai movies. The book has the entire screenplay and some stunning color stills from the movie.  There are some brief, tantalizing sidebar vignettes about the cast, crew, and production. Like another reviewer, I would have liked more of this background information.  But hey, I'm greedy 
 My daughter is thrilled with the quality and heft of the knives 
 The film, "Fatal Attraction," features a dangerous woman - lethal, in fact. "The Maltese Falcon's" Brigid O'Shaughnessy is certainly a hazard. "What makes a woman dangerous?" Is she irresistible? Seductive? Does she wound with her eyes? Is she a femme fatale, "aware of her power, or utterly innocent of it?" Otto Penzler, editor, bookseller, and founder of Mysterious Press, asks this question in his Introduction to this short fiction anthology, "Dangerous Women." The answer is subjective - a matter of opinion. Seventeen outstanding authors, some of the best writers in the mystery/suspense genre, answer the question here, creatively, diabolically, deliciously. Lying, manipulation, seduction, horror, murder, secretiveness, suicide - they're all covered in these stories. "Dangerous Women" is an outstanding, wicked, absolutely amazing collection. Consistent excellence is what makes this book so special and sets it apart from the rest. Ed McBain, Michael Connelly, Joyce Carol Oates, Anne Perry, Elmore Leonard, Walter Mosley, Laura Lippman, Nelson DeMille, Thomas Cook, Andrew Klaven, John Connolly, Lorenzo Carcaterra, J. A.  Jance, Jay McInerey, S. J. Rozen, Jeffrey Deaver and Ian Ranki, are all at their best here.    In Ed McBain's "Improvisation," a man approaches a tall, willowy blonde at a bar and asks her - "So, what do we do for a little excitement tonight?" The woman, a stranger, suggests, "Why don't we kill somebody?" Their mating ritual lightens up, but only momentarily. Michael Connelly's Detective Harry Bosch, says, in "Cielo Azul," that his LAPD partner always believed "the most dangerous women are beautiful in life, heartbreaking in death." "A black and silver diamond-headed spider, the so-called 'happy spider,' " who spins her web with venom, is Joyce Carol Oates' kind of woman in "Give Me Your Heart." Talk about a woman scorned! Walter Mosley's "Karma" loved somebody so much she'd die for him. "Rendezvous," Nelson DeMille's first short story in twenty-five years, takes you into a sweltering Vietnamese jungle where the most lethal enemy is not a man at all. Ian Rankin writes about a prison warden fascinated by the steamy prison mail he censors in "Soft Spot." Jeffrey Deaver's "Born Bad" is chilling! Every one of these stories is a gem, along with those I have not mentioned.   This is the perfect book to take on a trip....or on the train to work...or for reading during lunch hour. You can read a short story as satisfying as any novel, and put the book down without feeling that you have left at a crucial moment in the narrative. You can read selectively, or read only one story at a time. They are all winners. "Dangerous Women" is probably the best and most exciting mystery anthology I have ever come across. Highly recommended! JAN 
 Excellent information on how to keep your bones healthy, with all the latest research, and easy-to-do exercises.  Or if you have already developed osteoporosis, the book has authoritative and complete information on what you and your doctor can do to prevent more problems.  Should be required reading for every woman 
 More tips for those in direct sales.  Awesome!  I can't begin to say how much I love the Build it Big Books.  This is the sequel to Build it Big and will help the novices in the field or the experts 
 without a doubt, art wolfe, one of our foremost photographers, has outstanding wildlife work showcased here in color plate after color plate. this book's true value, however, arrives in the discussion between wolfe and martha hill, former picture editor of audubon magazine. for all but those already well-versed in the magazine and book trade, this dialogue will provide deep insights into how to photograph for publication. hill's comments on what does and does not work for various layouts is invaluable. i highly recommend this title 
 "Original Sin" is probably Angelina Jolie's sexiest movie since "Gia."   The movie "Original Sin" is about an aristocrat seeking a wife from far away. With picture in hand Luis (played by Antonio Banderas) goes to claim the lovely Julia (played by Angelina Jolie) which whom he is supposed to make his wife.  From that time forward, his world is filled with secret, lies, deceit, and sex.    I personally loved this movie, despite the reviews some have given it.  It's full of twists and turns and surprises. Banderas and Jolie have great chemistry in it as well.    I'd only warn young viewers because of the strong sexual content in a particular scene, as well as some violence (some of a sexual nature).  Pick this one up; you won't be dissapointed. 
 This book has a lot of information that is great. It goes to the next step of cake decorating 
 Christopher Marlowe is awsone. What other Renaissance writer was a freakin' spy? I mean, I like Shakespeare's plays and all, but as a person he's boring unless he's being played by Joseph Fiennes. I often pit two historical figures against one another in my mind, and I wonder what would happen if these two fought.  If Shakespeare and Marlowe fought, Marlowe would bust out his super secret digital watch-that's secretly a laser-and he'd slice Shakespeare in half. Maybe `Speare would have a deadly quill like the Joker had in Batman, but a deadly quill versus a laser? I think we know who would win. I know the digital watch/laser is a bit silly because they didn't have digital watches back then, but at the very least he'd have an hourglass with a secret laser.  Reading Dr. Faustus I realize what a shame it is Marlowe died so early. Marlowe's ability to combine drama and comedy was light years ahead of Shakespeare's. It wasn't until the second half of Shakespeare's career that he started writing dark comedies, but Marlowe was interjecting his humor with a dark twist right away with plays like Dr. Faustus and The Jew of Malta. If Marlowe hadn't dies so early (in a fight over who was going to pay the bill no less-freakin' cool!) then maybe there would have been two playwriting giants in London competing against one another. Just imagine the masterpieces that would have ensued. I bet they would have made King Lear look like A Comedy of Errors.  This is the second time I've read Dr. Faustus, and I had forgotten how anti-Catholic it is. The story takes place mostly in Wittenberg, Germany where Martin Luther wrote his famous 95 theses. The location already sets up the tenuous relationship between Protestants and Catholics. This relationship, obviously biased against Catholics, is further represented in the good angel and bad angel that appear to Dr. Faustus several times. The good angel repeats over and over to Dr. Faustus that he can repent at any time and come back into good graces, while the bad angel keeps on telling him it's too late. The obvious analogy is that the good angel represents the Protestant idea of justification by faith. Not surprisingly, one of the groups of people who Marlowe is rumored to have spied on were Catholics intent on overthrowing what they saw as England's Protestant government. Furthermore, the first thing Dr. Faustus does when he makes his famous bargain is to play a practical joke on the Pope.  Please, if you're Catholic don't let this turn you away from reading this beautifully written play. At times the mixture of slapstick comedy and high brow allusions are a bit uneven, but that was the nature of the beast back then. Marlowe had to play to the peasants as well as royalty.  The trick Marlowe plays on the audience is even greater than the trick played on Faustus. Marlowe actually gets us to care about Faustus by the end of the play. This is either a trick to show us how close every one of us is to making a Faustian bargain, or it's a trick to show us how unfair these religious traditions were. After all, what did Faustus do that was so wrong? He goes into the deal with plans for making himself a despot, and ends up using all of his power to fetch grapes for debutants and summon Helen of Troy so that others may see her beauty. (Dr. Faustus has "phenominal cosmic power," and all he can manage is playing a few practical jokes and impressing people with out of season fruits.) He's never punished for his bad acts, but rather because of who he pledged his allegiance to. Over the course of twenty-four years Faustus has actually become a somewhat better person if only because he recognizes his sins. His greatest crimes are nothing more than playing practical jokes on peasants. He's not perfect, but he's also not deserving of eternal damnation.  I see Dr. Faustus as a critique of religion. Others may find that it only reinforces their beliefs, and that's what makes the text so good. The Faustian bargain finds its way into literature time and again, but it means something different to each author; likewise, Dr. Faustus means something different to each reader 
 ..but with Tom Waits, that's exactly how it should be. Frank's Wild Years was my first disc of his, and boy it had taken a while to reach the point where I got the courage to get it.   That has all changed.   The man is, as someone else said here: "...a genius, complete unto himself.." and even if you don't like his music, or try (and fail) to get it, I would still have to say the summation is right.  Tom Waits has created a musical universe all his own, and I personally still feel "Frank's Wild Years" is one of his greatest discs.  What underpin even his most way-out recordings are honesty, compassion, and, yes, innocence that bore right through the characters he embodies, and in turn, tear you apart when you play the disc. His beautifully broken voice, combined with the "don't mow the lawn' approach to recording give the songs a grubby yet epic quality hard to overstate or describe.  I feel "Tom's Wild Years", with its more "mainstream" (relatively speaking) approach, is a good entry point for newcomers. It also happens to be one of his masterpieces.    CC        
 I am shocked at some of the bad reviews below....  I guess the book was set up well for me because I can see how someone just picking this up at random could find it quite boring.  I was suggested to read this from a friend who told me it was one of the best books she has ever read in her life, but yet one of the worst stories.  I love the book, though.  Jubal makes a great comment that really relates how I view "Stranger in a Strange Land"  "Anybody can see a pretty girl.  An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become.  A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl she used to be.  A great artist can look at an old woman, portray her exactly as she is... and force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be... more than that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo see that this lovely young girl is still alive, prisoned inside her ruined body.  He can make you feel the quiet, endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who ever grew older than eighteen in her heart... no matter what the merciless hours have done."  The story and plot itself is, honestly, a boring old woman compared to other stories "meant" to excite you.  I feel I see so many of the points behind the actual story itself, though.  If you really analyze this book as you read (which isn't hard because Heinlein does a great job of almost forcing you to think and relate), you will see so many relevancies to so many things.  Beyond that, the concept, if read and understood from start to finish, is quite genius.  Buy this book and be prepared.  This is a trip and a work of art.  You must treat is as a work of art and give it the attention it deserves.  The more attention you put into it, the more you will get out of it at the end.  Enjoy 
 Two Kingdoms, Two Loyalties is an an extremely helpful book.  Well-researched and well-written, it sheds considerable light on the American state in the twentieth century and on the nature of  "conservative" Protestantism in the modern U.S 
 Baseball and the mystic.  Kinsella does a great job of satisfied the baseball addict's need for a good story with the game or its players as the focus.  I loved "Shoeless Joe" but was surprised to find these  short stories almost as enjoyable.  Some of the language is strong but I  recommended it to my adolescent son, none the less,and he fell in love in  it.  Such fun to read. It helped pass those long night between the end of  the World Series and the start of Spring trainin 
 Mr. Langford certainly deserves praise for his continued excellence in photographic writing. 'Basic Photography' is THE manual for photographers. It is clear, concise and entertaining to read. This book should be in every photographers library 
 good quality, only issue was delivery through UPS couldnt be delivered to my apt so quite a hassle and delay receiving 
 this book is excellent,like the reviewer below me said you can skip through and find an entry you want. or you can read it all the way through. i really enjoyed all the wonderful topics they had in here,history.  differents types of witchcraft. the people that helped the craft out. the  witchhunters. it explains alot of basics of the craft. this is a good book  for the beginner-advanced 
 Thank you dear Fabrizio for your last wonderul recor 
 Like all great Agatha Christie's books, this one is also a gem 
 Many games my kids have aren't actually geared towards kids.  This game is perfect for children.  It's fun without being too hard or easy.  My children are 6 and 8 years old and can be challenged and entertained.  I highly recommend this as a great family game.  Many games we can take turns playing 
 Patricia Arquette and Michael Madsen are amazingly wonderful in this film.  And I don't understand why this film is not on sale anymore. Is there any  way we could get it back. I'm dying to buy it. This is the best road movie  I've ever seen in years  
 No matter how lost I am Richard Bach always takes me back to my personal truth, to my own personal reality. He's always a sweetheart and he always makes me cry. This book is an incredibly simple reminder of an incredibly simple truth we forget most of the time. The watercolors that accompany it are magnificent and convey an uncanny visual feeling of how I feel when I read Richard's books. If you have any inkling of what Bach is all about---as far as that's anywhere near possible---then add this book to your heart. 
 If you are young, under 30, this is a good guide to help you figure out your path through the minefields of trying to understand the other sex.  If you are older, this is a good refresher course on things you may have already learned (or things that you missed) in the school of everyday life.  For both younger and older readers this is a very good tool to help you understand yourself and others. 
  I have the second part of this movie Major League Part II and knew that I had to get the first part to add to my DVD collection. 
 No real complaints, this is a handy reference as other reviewers have pointed out.  However I can't give it five stars because for me it just isn't deep enough.  I find using a study Bible more useful for this type of overview, and there is a plethora of reference material available for deeper studies.  Well done and useful, but just does not fill a need for me personally 
 I use this book in teaching field and studio production, and advanced  camera and lighting techniques. Great reference, sometimes a little  overwhelming for the beginner, but well worth the price of admission.  Topics treated with professionalism and humor -- a grip with a grin 
 This is one of the greatest classic in literature, the only downside is that it is a little long. You will really need some time to get through this one 
 Few modern novels have the emotional nor spiritual depth to delve so profoundly into the truth of the human person as this West classic. Rooted very much into the "Catholic" experience, yet going beyond just religious tradition, Morris West reaches into the struggle of being a whole person in a world that so seeks to fragment and manipulate us. From Msgr. Meredith, the priest in crisis, to the assorted characters that inhabit the impoverished Italian village where this story takes it's shape, "The Devil's Advocate" is a profoundly sympathetic and honest examination of what we all are born to seek: integrity, wisdom, compassion and the humilty to be open to the promptings of Divine grace. God loves His people, His beloved. This would be easier to believe if we could come to love ourselves more truly. This is a marvelously told parable for today. For all days 
 This, one of the few taped performances of Gelsey Kirkland live, is a must for balletomanes everywhere. This performance showcases both Misha and Gelsey at the height of their fame, the mid-1970's. The technique and refinement is evident in their Don Quixote varation. Gelsey's pointework is divine, and no one quite matches the height of Misha's tours en l'air. Their popularity touched off the dance craze that carried through much of the 80's and is a nice portrait of 2 of American Ballet Theater's finest artists. If you are a dance enthusiast, you will treasure this 
 Helpful book as well as enjoyable to read 
 This was a fantastic book! It had a little mystery, some fantasy, and some adventure. I couldn't stop reading it! You should definitely read this book because its the best. It gives the phrase "page-turner" a whole new meaning 
 It is a  good funny book. If you love to laugh hard this is your book!  There is a boy who is trying to save a baby dragon. The boy has to go through a lot of chaos to help the dragon! it is funny, and it will teach you a lot  about animals! This is one of the best books I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 When this came out it was a real revelation. OK I had the single with John Lydon (Open UP) that had come out a while earlier. However the rest is also very very strong such as the track Original with the singer from Curve. Excellent 
 Wouldn't you think a product whose title reads "with Dual Power Source" would actually include the AC adapter? Not in this case, although I can order one separately.   If you in fact want the AC adapter to arrive in the same package as your cassette recorder, be sure you order the Sony TCM-210DV, which I now understand is the model I should have ordered. The TCM-210DV appears to be identical to the TCM-200DV but includes the AC adapter.  Although I don't have the AC adapter I wanted as insurance for the occasions on which I record on tape, the recorder performs just fine on battery. I use it primarily to play audiobooks from the public library, because a Walkman or other play-only motor is not powerful enough for old, worn cassettes 
 This cookbook is kind of like "The Joy of Cooking" for vegetarians.  It has an amazing comprehensive section on different kinds of vegetables.  I really like that it actually lists recipes by vegetables so that you can try to find a recipe with what's on sale at the store, or just try one of those "weird" vegetables that seemed too intimidating before.  My only criticisms of the book is that it doesn't offer a lot of good lower fat substitutes in recipes (there's a lot of fattening stuff in here!), and somehow, it feels like it's missing some of the creativity normally found in vegetarian cookbooks.  Don't be fooled by the bland recipe titles, every single recipe I've made has tasted and LOOKED amazing 
  Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is a fun read for all ages.  The story is about Roy, the new kid at school, who is subjected to bullying by Dana, a notoriously mean, bad to the bone lout. That bullying leads Roy on an adventure he never anticipated where he finds an unlikely ally in a no nonsense girl named Beatrice, who is one tough cookie and more than a match for the dreadful Dana! Enjoy the satisfaction when the the tables are turned and Dana finally is on the receiving end and gets what's coming to him! Humor is a staple throughout Carl Hiassen's books and Hoot is no exception. Sometimes you just have to laugh out loud! Given as a Christmas gift along with Hiaasen's 'Flush' to our oldest granddaughter, she has told us she enjoyed both books enormously. It is going to make it hard this Christmas to find books this entertaining to give her! She is an avid reader. You know you did good when a fourteen year old says, 'you always give me the best gifts' and includes these books in her list! 
 I wasn't sure on the first listen but after the 2nd or 3rd time I really started to like it. I haven't seen Apocalypto yet so I don't know how well the music goes with the film but I found it an enjoyable listen on it's own. The music is quite original and not what I expected although you can hear bits of The New World in some of the slower tracks, which isn't a bad thing, I love that score. I enjoyed the action jungle music, some of it had a Skull Island sort of feel to it. 
 "Two orphans and a world of monsters await you--and even reluctant readers will enjoy this hilarious new series by the creator of the popular Zak Files books.  In Book One, nobody wants to adopt the Shluffmuffin twins. Wally's feet stink something awful and Cheyenne is allergic to everything--and then some. So why are the Mandible sisters so eager to take them home? And what sort of old maids would choose to live in a place called Dripping Fang Forest, where zombies and 10-foot-long slugs wander? Would it seem ungrateful of Wally to point out the Mandible sisters' extra arms? Or to venture into the cellar, where the twins have been told to NEVER, EVER, EVER go? Perhaps that last bit was a mistake. Now there's nothing left for the Shluffmuffins to do but run for their lives!" (summary from the publisher's website 
 Rick Dagwan's teaching opened my eyes and made me realize how a mass medium such as movies or television can be used to manipulate the beliefs, desires, and feelings of a great many people -- often to the point where an  expert at media manipulation can become rich, or powerful, or both. (Is it  just a coincidence that we end up electing the politicians who run the best  TV commercials?) Advertising is one of the most insidious tools of the  Conspiracy, in that it is so omnipresent ithat many of us don't even  realize just how much of an effect it has on us. This is where books like  Adcult USA come in. This book is a searing jolt of truth that wakes ups up  and shows us just how much of our culture is shaped through advertising  (the entire Christmas holiday season, for starters), while at the same time  reminding us that we like to be advertised to. Because we've been bombarded  with advertising for our entire lives, we've become used to it and this  makes us receptive to short messages that insinute themselves into our  culture. Adcult USA can be seen as a wake-up call or just a hell of an  entertaining read, but it's likely to make you think twice when you watch  TV or read 
 The Go-Gos had a sound,feel and mood that was all their own.Not one female group,has come even close to their sound.Bananarama and Bangles had a certain style too,but the Go-Gos were in a class all by themselves.Kinda the female version of the Beach Boys,if you will.I still find time to kick back,and listen to an era of music that has since bit the dust.With the garbage that has since taken their place.Come on Jane,Charlotte,Belinda and Cathylets do it again one more time!! 
 I grew up inspired by Science Fiction, and eventually had the privilege of working on the Space Shuttle program for several years.  Of all the many SF stories I have read, The Menace From Earth has always been one of my favorites.  There are other stories more technically inspiring, or with better drawn characters.  There is none that conveys the sense of humans fitting in to a non-earth environment and making it their home with such ease and inspiration.  When the flying starts, the story becomes simply lyrical 
 If you grew up watching the Twilight Zone in reruns on your local TV station, you've never seen these hour-long episodes. That's right there are 18 episodes of the Zone that were lost and now are found. Once only available on specialty cable channels, these hour episodes are collected here in a great set. Each episode has been remastered from the original film negatives for the best possible picture and sound. You should know, though, that these hour episodes don't quite flow as easy as the half hour ones. In many cases this is good because it provides for more character development and suspense. "The Thirty-Fathom Grave" builds nicely. "On Thursday We Leave For Home" is an unforgetable character study with an incredible performance by Richard Widmark. "Printer's Devil" features Burgess Meredith so that one could be 4 hours long and still be entertaining. But episode like "No Time Like The Past" and "In His Image" and "Jess-Belle" seem a little padded. Taken as a whole this is a great set and for a long-time fan of the show like myself, a real treat to see "new" episodes of one of the greatest shows in TV history. I recommend it 
 Kurt Cobain was a talented and tortured artist that had a tremendous impact on my life.  His songs, more specifically, his poems, really inspired me to write as well and publish my first book. So when I first heard about this book, I was immediately drawn to it.  I had strong feelings of interest beset by a sense of respect for him as a person.  I wondered if reading his personal journals would be kind of like trespassing, an invasion of privacy, something Kurt would be offended by. But Kurt invites all fans and critics to go ahead and probe around to try to figure him out.  So, with hesitation, I embarked on this journey, completely drawn into the mind of my favorite true artist. Anyone who can appreciate art might be intrigued by this book.  It's a lot of scattered thoughts, eloquent poems, random and bizzare drawings--just Kurt pouring his heart out on paper. Kurt's humor and sarcasm are embedded throughout this book.  Many people find so much meaning in every single statement, plus any depressing thought captured is viewed as foreshadowing.  C'mon people. Everything in this book encapsulates some emotion we all have felt.  People overanalyzing every single scribble of pencil or pen is a complete joke that I'm sure Kurt finds humorous. Anyways, this collection of journals just adds to the mysticism of Kurt's life and "suicide".  Some questions are better left unanswered.  
 Simply put, this book is the reason I enjoy cooking today.  Other reviewers have claimed, correctly, that the ingredients may be difficult to find for certain recipes, or that the instructions may occasionally be complicated, even confusing.  These claims are true, but I want to say as respectfully and humbly as I possibly can that these reviewers may be missing the point of Tyler's cooking, which is to create a child-like (and I mean that in a very positive way) curiosity and passion for food, and to make meals that are so delicious that you'll forget your own name while savoring the flavors.  Tyler cooks for excellence. He doesn't want to make just pork chops; he wants to make the best pork chops you've ever had in your life. And the recipe in this book, "Thick Pork Chops with Spiced Apples and Raisins," will make the best pork chops you've ever had in your life, guaranteed.  The recipes are hard but far from impossible; some of them are time-consuming, but over time they get easier and easier. I don't even need to look at the recipe for the pork chops any more, and considering how many ingredients there are, that's an accomplishment.  But that's the beauty of these recipes - they're so consistently excellent that you'll keep coming back for more, and as you do, you'll start picking up the little things that make up each flavor, and before you even realize it, you'll find yourself a better cook than you ever were before, excited about food rather than just stuffing something down your throat three times a day.  Before I read this book, I couldn't tell the difference between thyme and sage, or anything else leafy and green. Now I don't even have to look; my nose can tell the difference immediately.  Again, I don't mean any disrespect to the other reviewers who didn't care for this book, because it isn't for everybody. But if you want to be genuinely excited about dinner again, or if you want to inspire a really healthy love for food amongst your friends and family, then I recommend this book. Tyler loves food because he loves life, and it shows 
 This British diplomat is a total arrogant pig!  We know from the beginning that he is a dastardly murderer, but we read and find how Alex Cross, my favorite Patterson character, solves the crimes and gets the guy (harder than you think!).  This jerk pretends to be a normal family man, but hates his wife and kids.  He gets off by murdering young women and anyone who gets in his way.  He is sick enough to create a scene after the murder in many cases.    Alex comes to the rescue again, but has to really work to bring him down - he did, didn't he 
 The Anapanasati Sutra is the simplest of the several teachings of the Buddha on mindfulness and meditation. In many ways it is the very basis of the Vapassana tradition and the core of Insight Meditation. Mr. Rosenberg does not get carried away with this teaching, but approaches the sutra in a traditional manner. Of the many meditation books I have read, including better known Insight Meditation books, this is the easiest to understand and follow. Mr. Rosenberg is a very experienced teacher of this approach to meditation and the book shows it.  This was the only Dharma book I took on a self-guided meditation retreat last winter. I am now on my third reading of it and I am finding it as helpful now as the first time. If you are interested in a basic approach to Insight Meditation and a clear description of the Buddha's most elementary teaching on meditation, this is for you. I give this my highest recommendation 
 I did a LOT of research about digital cameras before making a purchase.  Probably 50 hours on [...] and [...] and price checks on 10 different websites and asked everyone I knew what they liked and didn't like about their cameras.  I AM SO HAPPY I PICKED THIS ONE.  It is very lightweight yet durable, sleek and attractive if that's what you want.  The large viewfinder is a great asset.  Great zoom capabilities although I will say the picture quality (on the screen, anyway) is somewhat compromised (gets a little grainy) on the max zoom.  I will probably only use 6 or 7 of the "Best Shot" modes on a regular basis but it's fun to experiment with them all.  VERY LONG battery life.  I took this camera on a 7-night cruise and didn't have to recharge it at all.  I have 2 friends who are ready to buy new cameras and they are going to get this one 
 There are an abundance of books that provide women and their partners an opportunity to learn about pregnancy.  "GETTING TO KNOW YOU" is also about learning but the learning occurs through self-reflection.  Each provides a "starter sentence" that inspires a stream of thoughts, feelings, and emotions to be captured in words, drawings, or mementos on each page.     Since this journal is created to be carried and written in, even when you are on the "go" or at any time during the pregnancy (see page ix), inviting the writer to quiet and focus themselves even amidst daily tasks, like a doctor's visit.  In essence, "GETTING TO KNOW YOU" is an opportunity for your child in later years (think teenager angst and disconnect)  to intimately get to know you from your act of preserving the "prequel" to their life - and what is lovelier than that!     My only criticism is that it refers to "mommy" and "daddy" throughout the book.  And we all know families can now publicly consist of two (or one) mommies, daddies, unrelated guardians, a grandma/pa and a mommy/daddy, etc...  This choice is understandable given the publishing company and the audience trying to be reached.  I just think the opportunity for a larger, more diverse audience, to benefit from this beautiful and thoughtful book is being missed.  Even so, I have purchased four of the books - two for friends (one single and one not) who are currently pregnant and two for those future mommies!  Highly recommended.   I would love to see a similar journal for people looking to adopt. 
 This is a really good album.  The song Loose Booty is a good song even though I don't understand it.  The names Shadrach,Meschach and Abednego were unfimilar but I looked them up and I was thinking they put people in the bible in their song.  I was amazed.  The song has a nice beat.  Overall it's a good album and it has a nice cover.  And you should go out and buy it.  Trust me I have a lot of the Family Stone's songs and they are the best 
 Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities" is justifiably a classic of political science and history. Its impact on the study of nationalism - which is arguably the ideology most resistant to academic study - can hardly be measured.  Anderson, a specialist in South-East Asian history, lets his scholarly instincts roam across the entire world as he seeks to explain just why it is that nationalism has become so prevalent in the world. What factors have meant that we take pride in someone dying "for our nation", while we don't take the same pride in someone dying "for our political beliefs"? The answer, somewhat surprisingly, begins with a description of the origins and impact of the printing press. Anderson's argument, particularly the section most well-known to his readers, is that the ability of those living in a particular place to read in their own language (as against Latin, Arabic, Sanskrit or Chinese) began this process. It was enhanced, he contends, with the production of newspapers, allowing people to "imagine" themselves as Peruvian or Chilean, rather than as Spanish colonials. Yes, the choices of nation were used advisedly above, as Anderson's second striking conclusion is that nationalism is a new-world (i.e. the Americas) phenomenon. The "Creole" intelligentsia, allowed to progress only so far by their colonial rulers, became the fertile ground necessary for nationalist ideals.  Anderson also discusses "official" nationalism in some depth, focusing on Europe and making some quite surprising comments regarding the penetration of the various vernacular languages into their respective empires. This analysis seems a little more forced at times, but the general point remains that a "nation" is essentially a modern and "imagined" community.  The revised edition of this work also goes into some detail about the roles of censuses, maps and museums in the creation of nationalism. Using his South-East Asian training, Anderson is able to explain such things as the importance of West Papua to Indonesia, despite the marked cultural differences between most Indonesians and citizens of that province. While this analysis is self-consciously global in scope, Anderson is modest enough to remind the reader that his training is in one region alone. This is a refreshing change from many scholars, who propound theories of global scope based only on observations of a limited series of events.  "Imagined Communities" is, as indicated above, a read of considerable intellectual robustness. It is not, however, a read for the casual history-reader. Anderson makes many demands on his readers, not the least of which is to follow his logic which is not always entirely apparent. With that in mind, the book can be recommended to all with an academic interest in history, but with considerable reservations to those without 
 This is high quality trance with beutiful vocals. A must for ANY dance fa 
 It's hard to outdo yourself when you're Gordon Wood, but he nevertheless proves himself yet again with this book.  So many books on the founding of America focus on the war itself or the political problems facing the writers of the Constitution( i.e. slavery, states' rights, etc).  Others, like Jack Greene in "Pursuits of Happiness", make further inroads by laying out the conditions and developments which led to the mindset of the 1776 American patriot.  But Wood goes even further, brilliantly outlining the development of the social thought of the day, the social thought which, in its time, was more revolutionary than any war of independence.    Perhaps Wood's greatest point in this book is that America's social revolution was natural, and occured over the space of decades.  He rightly lends creedence to the idea that this slow introdution and infusion of values and institutions was crucial to making them stick.  In contrast, we have the French Revolution, where an entire society was "re-moralized" head to toe, imposed from the top down, in the space of a few months.    Wood's title is a bit misleading.  We today think of the word "radical" in negative terms, the image of rabbles of unbathed psuedo-anarchists burning down fast food restaurants.  It is not Wood's intention to compare the mindset of 18th Century America with modern armchair revolutionaries.  But for its time, the mindset of 18th Century America was indeed quite radical in comparison with that of continental Europe.  The fact that this mindset arose peacefully and naturally, and not forced by elitist do-gooders, is perhaps what makes it so radical 
 After jumping on and then off this system's band wagon about 40 times in the last month, my wife and I finally decided to get this system.  When I decided that I was finally going to break down and get some speakers, cause the ones in my TV were going out, I originally saw this system in a infomercial and fell in love with it, just because of it's simplicity.  After reading the reviews online, I have to admit I was leery about it, since it didn't really shine to some people.  But after visiting a factory store this last weekend in Las Vegas and getting to hear this system, I realized for what it is, it is outstanding.    First of all, if you are wanting full 5.1 or 7.1 system, don't buy this.  If you want to run the wires to get the true surround sound, this system isn't what you are looking for.  Know what you are buying people.   But if you are looking for an adequate solution to better sounding TV, games and DVD's, then this is the system for you.  These little speakers and subwoofer are able to bounce sound off of walls to make you feel like you are surrounded in sound.  We have a big living room were this is set up, and it works great.  In a 15 X 25 room with vaulted ceilings, it still sounds great.  We watch Mission Impossible II as our first full length movie and it delivered like were were at a theater.  We then put in the grand daddy of tests for me.  Jurassic Park.  The T-Rex scene was clear and loud and scary as ever.    Set up was really easy too.  Took me about 2 hours, but that was because I was being really careful to keep my cords organized and also being really lazy by not pulling the TV out from the wall.  The DVD until runs well with my Direct TV and Xbox.  I can't wait to load up a game and see how the sound is on that.  As far as regular TV viewing, we watched the Grammy's last night, and you could hear the crowd noise like it was around you, not just coming at you.    All in all, this unit is exceptional.  For what it is, it is great.  True, it isn't the same as a true surround sound system, but I don't think it claims to be.  We bought this system as a starter, cause when we build a new house we are going to run the speaker wire to do a true system and them move this one to our master bedroom for future use.    We used this with a 10 year old TV too, and it's like the TV is brand new.  We plan on adding a 46 flat screen in the near future, so I can only imagine the experience will get better.    My recommendation, take these reviews (even mine) with a grain of salt.  Try to find a factory store where you can go and hear them in person, then come here to buy if you want.  They also have great deals on refurbished systems, which carry the same warranty that the new systems do.  You can save 300 bucks just to buy one that someone returned because they didn't like it and get the same warranty.   
 Bill Viola rules my dreams. The exhibition at the Whitney stunned me and it stayed with me for a long time. I wish there were more images from his notebooks in this collection since the display of notes/inspirations were  as fascinating as the installations themselves. You might have seen some of  his work featured in the recent Nine Inch Nails US tour. If you want to see  the zenith of video/installation art, you must spend some time with Bill  Viola's work. (He's also a delight to meet) 
 This is the best of the best.  Hands down this is one of the best broadway concerts you will EVER see.  Colm Wilkinson, Lea Salonga, Michael Ball are all amazing.  Fabulous talent, great singing 
 I bought this toy of my 2 grandchildren, ages 3 and 7.  So far they love it.  Granted, my 7 yr old is barely able to fit on it and it won't be long before he outgrows the toy (he wants to know why they can't make it bigger).  My three year old has a ball, especially with the "Simon Says" feature.  I do agree that it does not work a well on a carpet.  It tends to slow down the spinning, but all in all, both kids love it! 
 I find it suprising how so many people can not like this book? I read it immediatley after reading book 1 and still thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the details the author gives...it makes you feel like you are right there, and understand and see things as well as the characters do.  I can't wait for book 3, and hope everyone at least gives this book a chance and enjoys it as much as I did. Despite the reviews.. 
 Abel's Island started with a rich mouse named Abel.  He and his wife, Amanda, went on a picnic.  Abel went in the  woods and got a flower for Amanda.  When he returned, it started to rain.  They packed up and went in a cave.  A gust of wind blew Amanda's scarf away.  Abel went to get it.  He was blown into a stream.  He quickly built a raft.  He floated toward an island.  There, Abel carved family, found a log for a home, and even found a book!  After a couple months, an owl came into his life and attacked him.  After the attack, Abel put his pen knife on a long rod.  The next time the owl attacked, Abel was waiting.  Abel stabbed the owl.  Soon the owl went away.  Once when ABel was looking at the river, a frog named Gower came up.  They became friends.  When Gower went to swim across the river, he said he will send help.  Soon no help arrived.  Abel was going to try to swim across the river.  He somehow made it, then landed under a rock and slept.  When he woke, a cat was looking at him.  Abel ran up a tree.  The cat jumped at him, missed, and fell.  Abel finally made it home.  I recommend this book because it has some action and adventure.  It also has a great ending 
 The latest album by Carmen Rizzo "The Lost Art of the Idle Moment" is a terrific album for all fans of music to enjoy. Known for his amazing producing, co-writing, engineering, mixing, and musical skills for various artists, awarding him with two previous Grammy Nominations, Carmen Rizzo's work shines through the different tracks on his record. A musical style that can be known as electronic ambient pop, his music captures you in with his creativy to enjoy yourself and feel his work. It is an amazing album that deserves recognition 
 ian mcculloch and co. practically invented the british guitar rock later adopted by the likes of the smiths, the stone rose, et. al.  more melodic and accessible than the likes of joy division, echo and the bunnymen straddled the line between exquisite song crafting and experimentation.   ian mcculloch proved to be the perfect frontman -- the trademark haircut, the trenchcoat, the voice that threated to crack at any second, the enigmatic persona.  while not a truly gifted vocalist, he never had to be. his raspy voice is ideally suited to the music.  much of the bunnymen's charm lay in their working class roots, settling for less than perfect, slightly gritty production and focusing instead on quality beats and melodies. will sargeant single-handedly ushered in a new guitar movement. his playing was sometimes intrusive in the beginning, but always interesting melodically and sonically as he matured. (and coldplay oughta be paying him royalties for the riffs they've nicked from him.) add to that a more than capable rhythm section (r.i.p., pete), and the bunnymen became one of the most influential rock bands of the last 25 years.  some of the finest bunnymen songs are found here: the oft mentioned 'the killing moon,' 'never stop,' 'the cutter,' 'the rescue,' etc.  even now (2005), they sound fresh.  every time i play this cd in my car or at home, i'm blown away by how utterly *fantastic* a band they really are--inventive, unique, and ridiculously original; excellent arrangements, flawless melodies, superb musicianship. of course, it always helps to have ian broudie doing the knob-twiddling.  this collection is something of 'greatest hits' that chronicles one of the most important 'post-punk' bands to ever come out of the UK. a must have for any music afficionado 
 I like Isis but never heard of Aereogramme. I must say the combination works great. I listen to theis cd a lot. It's not heavy like Isis but more like Red sparrowes only better 
 I found Alex's encouragement to find you own style and a very insightful analysis of his style to be quite informative.  I enjoyed his descriptions of how his pictures were designed and more importantly what worked and didn't work. The principles that he discussed on simplicity, value, color, movement, paper-doll and silhouette relatioships, design approaches, etc. were very helpful in trying to understand and improve my own crude attempts at painting. Alex must be a very fine teacher, as his narrative was concise and very on topic through out the book 
 I must say that it would be impossible to fit the best songs of Commissioned on one CD.  I own all of the CDs that these songs were taken from and I must tell you that Commissioned has seen me through many days.   One of the things that I like about Commissioned is that their message  never changed with the changes in the Gospel industry.  Jesus has always  been the focal point of every song and praise that these brothers have  made.  I recommend that you hurry up and purchase this and all the rest of  the CDs that Commissioned has done.  Email me if you need a list of the  albums 
 "Undine was fiercely independent and yet passionately imitative.  She wanted to surprise every one by her dash and originality, but she could not help modeling herself on the last person she met, and the confusion of ideals thus produced caused her much perturbation when she had to choose between two courses." p.457  The characters in Custom of the Country were fabulous, especially Elmer Moffatt.  The story itself proved to be an almost inexhaustible weave of aspirations and setbacks.  The up-and-coming young New York socialite, Undine Spragg, with her country background and concealed past, pushes incessantly to better her personal station.  Whether it is compromising her parents financial stability to marry into New York's society, crushing her first husband in favor of a richer more social benefactor, or finding her way into a scandalous second marriage with one of France's oldest families, Undine never stops aspiring for more.  She ultimately concludes (seemingly so) with her very first love, Elmer Moffatt.  Wharton leaves the reader with an unpredictable and winding path, to an inevitable conclusion 
 What really sets this book apart from many others is the wonderful use of language and image. The evocative idea of "Low Men in Yellow Coats"...by itself is almost silly and certainly not scary, but as it is repeated with added bits of observation, it becomes ominous.  King has always excelled at taking the everyday and spinning it just slightly to where it takes on more meaning than it should have. He achieves that agian with this collection 
 This book is a fascinating and invaluable tool for looking into the mindset of the London public while the JTR murders were taking place.  While I personally believe none of the letters came from the killer (save the possible exception of the Lusk letter), the letters themselves remain fascinating some grotesque and some being very eloquent.  At a time when I'm tired of the latest suspect theory being thrown about, this book is a welcome change.  
 i have reviewed many of these sets and have liked them all so i had no problem buying this set. i still can't get over the number of people who talk about the quailty of the pictures and sound. come on at 40 to 50 cents per movie what do you want. part of these old movies charm is the poor pictures and sound. the scrachs and audio pops are a part of the joy here. the ones i saw on saturday noon and late night t.v. did the same thing but i watched them anyway. as always some good some bad  and some that really can't be placed in a pigon hole movie wise.i will say my young sons sit and watch these westerns with me and love them. i has become a time to sit eat popcorn talk and cheer on the bad guys. really the fact that most of these movies are family friendly makes them an even better reason to buy this set. when was the last time your kids sat and watched a movie with you and said they liked these "old movies". get over it and enjoy the show 
 Ian McEwan's "The Cement Garden" is the ultimate perversion, a tale of four siblings whose lives decend into incest and other vices. The subject matter is shocking, but as I read the book I found the events becoming obvious.     Take the father, for instance. He's vile, stoic, and stubborn, and though there's no mention of his age, he comes across as a mean old man. The mother comes across as a weak-willed, emotionless middle-class British housewife, who gives her son the most inane warnins against masturbation and all the horrible things it does to you ("it takes a full pint of blood to replace it"). I knew from the get-go that both parents would die off quickly, since they are of such little consequence other than keeping up the apearance of a nuclear family. It came as no surprise that the children would hide the mother's body in the basement. Forget what she tells them about avoiding the orphanages; they seem to bury her in the basement as though they were casting her off. What do we dump in the basement? Here's some ideas; old furniture, old bikes, an old crib, the guitar you gave up, excess dishes, etc. The children dump the mother's corpse in the basement as though it were old furniture!     With the parents dead, the children do the usual kid stuff; they go to school, read, watch TV. But they don't seem to have any friends, and no adults inhabit the landscape. We don't see the friendly old grocer, the wise old newsagent, the milkman, or any of the adults or businesses that inhabit the world. It seems as though their home is alone in a vast prairie of concrete.      Left alone, the children engage in sexualized play that doesn't seem healthy. Julie, the oldest, indulges her 6 year old brother's infantilism and takes an older man as a boyfriend. Jack, the teenage boy, fantasizes (and eventualy has sex with) his older sister. Tom, the youngest boy, "experiments" with transvestism and degresses to infantilism. But there's another child, a 13 year old named Sue. She rarely figures in the book, spending most of her time alone. I wonder what she's thinking.     Why does Tom want to dress like a girl and be treated as an infant? Does he want attention? His older sisters don't just give him girl's clothes; they actively dress him in them. Is he looking for the attention his mother never showed? Julie eventualy tires of Tom's demands for attention, but after all, she indulged it in the first place.     I will not reveal the three events that take place at the end. But I will make the observation of the parents' influence (before they're quickly killed off). The mother tells Jack that masturbation can damage your health, but he learns from a teacher that it's natural. Has a burden been lifted off his head, or has he learned that vices have no drawbacks? If so, does he believe that other "perversions" are safe as well?     
 In the 20th (now 21st) century, there lies before us a truly tremendous and difficult problem, that is, if we have had direct spiritual experience in a world that does not officially recognize such. But that is only half of the problem. Are we to also conversely and in turn deny the truths disclosed to us by science and rational human knowledge?  This is the problem; how to bridge these two aspects of reality if we KNOW that they are BOTH real? For these are no longer simple times that we live in. There is simply too much legitimate "smarts" out there in science, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, physics, etc., etc. to simply deny them and still be honest with yourself. Yet again, to the contrary of that, what to do if you KNOW there is more?  Tortured with this problem and trying to wrestle out even some sliver of a solution myself, I finally came to the conclusion that the world of the 21st century needed something very unique and special; not just another scientist and not just another mystic. It needed an absolute, super high IQ brainiac genius with a super-compute mind who ALSO had legitimate spiritual experiences. Only such a person could ever solve the problem.  And then I remembered Ken Wilber.   I happened upon this book some ten years ago and the result was nothing less than sheer joy. I highly recommend it to all who might be interested and perhaps tortured by all of the same ideas I mentioned above. This is indeed a wonderful introduction to Ken Wilber's work. 
 I purchased the IH6 white.  Everything about it is fine, except that it won't dock with my Ipod.  I'm not sure what generation Ipod it is - it's about 3 years old - 20GB - click wheel - 4 horizonal buttons on top of click wheel.  Can someone offer me some advice?  Thanks 
 I recently purchased this cd again. I once owned it on cassette. Keith is a real smooth old school type singer and his music and sound has sustained very well since it was released in the early 90's. If you are building an old school collection with great singers this is a good one to have. It's great for romance or with that special lady.

 This is yet another great album by Sam. I was hoping for more originals, but yet he puts the Bush stamp on all these tunes. The only track I could do without is the Leon Russel tune Ballad of a Soldier. If you dig Sam other albums, you'll like like this one, all of his mandolin breaks are superb. Just saw him live in Chi-Town, and these songs sound even better in the live setting. Sam Bush For President 
 Most of the reviews above are political diatribes against Keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes. The key to understanding Keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle, an economy can become over-productive (or under-consumptive) and thus, a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand. Thus, full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria. If an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium, something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment. This something COULD be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions, it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment. Keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't. expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment. Borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick, direct way to restore full employment while at the same time, redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over-production in the first place. Although difficult to read, this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics. Far from being destructive, it alone has been responsible for nearly 60 years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the 1930's. I recommend you read this book 
 after reading Iovine's The Girlfriends' Guide to Surviving the First Year of Motherhood, I HAD to get her toddler book. I've never been so amused while reading a truthful book before! My parents have even read it and love it. It's a must have for all toddler moms 
 I am on the tail-end of treatment for breast cancer (surgery, chemo, and now radiation.) I have been sitting around doing almost nothing, and feeling out of breath just going up the stairs.  I already had Dr. Roizen's first RealAge book and loved it, so I decided to try this workout book to see if it could help me get moving again.  I immediately read the 59 pages for Phase 1, walking, and went for my first walk in months.  I have been doing it now for 2 weeks, and feel so much better already; can hardly wait to do Phase 2! Many thanks to both Dr. Roizen and Tracy Hafen for getting me moving again.  I not only feel better physically, but mentally also. 
 Awesome CD, one of my favourites, would recomend to anyone who likes cuban, latin music. Thomas's piano playing is great 
 To want to marry your best friend at age 6.  And the day you propose, your Dad has had too much to drink and drags you away from your friend's home kicking and screaming.  Then moves you away from her.  Not knowing why they can't see each other growing up, Dana fulfills her promise to Keri's mom (Moms) to always take care of Keri.  An accident brings them together again in their early 20s...Keri is such a spoiled bitch and it angers Dana so much, but still she can't let go.  Finally, another bad time brings them together for the final time to take their stand with each other against the evils in their world.  I enjoyed this book and found my eyes tearing many times 
 OK, I admit it.  I'm a huge fan of the Joe Grey series, and looked forward to the release of the next installment.  I was not disappointed.  It seems that there was more emphasis placed on the human characters in the story than some of the others.  But the feral cats put in another appearance, and a lot of attention is given to the relationship between Joe and Dulcie and their human companions.  A great book 
 My husband passed away and I found comfort through this book. It made me understand that my husband is safe and happy. I was always afraid of death and dying until I read this book. Now I just can't wait to see my husband at Home 
 I've used many brands of CF card, and some others are slow and sketchy--seem to need reformatting way too often. These SanDisk Ultra cards, however, are blazingly quick when storing images or transferring data and have never given me any trouble at all with data loss or corruption 
 I just upgraded SD v4 to SD5 and could not be happier. Release 5 has had a very rocky start to say the least. I do believe they released it a bit early. Fortunately I read the SD forums daily and only downloaded version 5 when it seemed the big bugs had been dealt with. I have always found this product to be the best in it's class. Best detection and moreover removal. Easy to use. I've also had the product that is typically rated number 1 and for me it is no contest which I will stick with. This is my main, real time anti spyware product.  I think one big plus is their customer service availability. This is important.  They are very responsive. Their forums on their website are also extremely helpful. Customer service is also free.  This application is fast and is not a resource hog. I have a lot of confidence in it. Also recently just downloaded their PC Tools Plus firewall...it's another great product and it is free! Basically a good company to deal with.  I believe when the dust settles from this new (albeit too early) release of version 5, you will see Spyware Doctor attain 1st place on many tech lists 
 A collection of first-person recollections of encounters between Texas settlers and Indians.  Historic accounts as told to the author of by those who lived at the time 
 This book looks dauntingly thick when you pick it up, but some brief exploration will show that including the interviews only 311 pages are the Jack Welch story-- the rest of the book is Afterword, GE Timeline, GE Shareholder Reports, Bibliography and finally a section meant to be applied to your own business. I suppose that there are readers out there who wanted that level of completeness in their history of GE. I did not. I stopped reading after the afterword.  The book covers GE during the period of Jack Welch's reign. Specifically, it charts his efforts in five major initiatives: Services, Six Sigma, Digitization, Succession, and the Honeywell acquisition.   I found it interesting and readable, although I was left with the feeling (despite the author's best efforts) that these were very difficult achievements to duplicate if you did not happen to be Jack Welch. Although ostensibly a business biography, I still had much more of a feel of personality than facts when I was done. I would have been pleased to have a less broad-ranging treatment which delved a little bit more deeply into some specific numbers and consequences. Although this information might have been contained in the investor reports, I had no patience to page through it and find the information 
 This text provides a thorough treatment of the time and frequency domain theory for time series data. It provides a rigorous and theoretical treatment. This is a graduate level text for statistics majors. It provides good coverage of ARIMA models. There are also a number of other good texts on time series analysis both theoretical and applied. Some like Koopmans' text and Bloomfield's emphasize the frequency domain and others like Box, Jenkins and Reinsel the time domain. Another excellent recent text is the one by Shumway and Stoffer. Chatfield's monograph provides a concise elementary introduction 
 This may be a brilliant and insightful book, but as an audio CD it is impossible to listen to.  I wish I had paid attention to the PW review, because it is all too apt. ("The Canadian author's bizarre, somewhat hypnotic reading style--with its randomly elongated vowels--is a cross between Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man character and a classic Yiddish whine.")  Imagine what it would sound like if English were chanted like a Hebrew prayer by a computer generated voice .  I still plan to read this highly praised book, but for me the audio version has been a complete disaster.  I have given up on it.  
 This mystery debut was at the top of my "to be read" pile, and I was glad I waited until vacation to begin it so that I could savor every page.  This finely crafted mystery keeps you turning the pages until the satisfying conclusion.  Not knowing much about antiques, I particularly enjoyed learning more about that rarefied world; but more than that, I appreciated the author's approach to the subject, which is precise but not fussy or pretentious.  The New England setting is particularly well done, capturing everything I love about New Hampshire (a place I'd love to retire, if it weren't for the astronomical property taxes).  I also enjoyed the story and the somewhat traditional murder mystery, which makes fine use of Ms. Cleland's abundant plotting skills.  All that aside, the character of Josie Prescott is enough to make any reader come back for more, especially since it seems clear that sparks will continue to fly between her and the police chief.  Read and enjoy 
 So this past spring I decided, once and for all, that I wanted to start a garden.  I had no experience in this subject, and I searched for a good book at the library.  I found this book.  I ended up renewing it five times, and finally ordering it from Amazon.com.  It has truly been a life saver.  What I like best is the way the book is laid out, with sections on vegetables, fruits, and flowers, as well as special sections on pests and other problems.  The book is well organized and the index points the reader in the right directions, making it easy to find what I'm looking for down to the tiniest detail.  The charts make it clear which San Francisco Bay Area microclimates are suitable for which plants, and the book explains down to the tiniest detail how to start plants, transplant them, grow them, and harvest them.  At the same time that this book is informative beyond all my original expections, is also excels in not being condescending (one of my pet peeves).  I believe it is the perfect book for the seasoned gardener just moving into the area, the seasoned gardener in need of more detailed information, and someone like me, with no gardening experience whatsoever 
 This book clarifies many aspects of our personalities, helping us to understand why many mental disorders are just one extreme in a continuous range of types, and provides some hints as to why many of those types have advantages and disadvantages that would explain why such a range of personalities ought to exist. I especially enjoyed their theory about how a smaller cerebellum could explain a number of different symptoms of a nerdy (mildly autistic) personality. I suspect it isn't exactly right, but it explains a good deal more than any alternative I've seen. One warning - this isn't very valuable as a self-help book. It should be read mainly to improve your understanding of the human mind, not as a means of changing it 
 The best work I've seen on the subject yet. A must read 
 This book is essential for any beginner to slightly advanced programmer! Everything about it was good.  Don't Listen to others who say the code doesn't work, Yeah AFTER you add some gibberish to it it won't but  everything works and the book is GREA 
 Most people have heard of Vincent Van Gogh, the famous--or infamous--nineteenth-century artist. He's the one who painted Starry Night and various Sowers and Sunflowers, among a very few. But he is also notorious as the deranged artist who cut off his ear in 1888.  What lead to this act of self-mutilation, this event known as "the Crisis"? In the weeks leading up to the Crisis, Van Gogh shared a cramped studio with another renowned artist, Paul Gauguin. Located in the southern French town of Arles, the Yellow House became the setting for one of art history's oddest pairings.  In hopes of changing the future of art, Van Gogh and Gauguin agreed to a period of collaboration. Great things indeed happened. But with such disparate personalities, the idyll of the artists' dream didn't last.  Martin Gayford presents an intimate look into a critical period in art history. Dogged research not only into letters written by Van Gogh and Gauguin, but through public records and more, has allowed Gayford to surmise what daily life must have been like for the two artists that autumn.  Art enthusiasts interested in either artist's story will find THE YELLOW HOUSE a fascinating study. Casual purveyors, however, might find their attention wanders when Gayford gets into minute details that mean more to an artist than the average person, such as the weather on a given day. Overall, this accounting of "nine turbulent weeks in Arles" is well done. It is less dry than many biographies, and there is a real sense of the rise and fall of the Yellow House studio, and the enormous emotional impact on all those involved.  This is a definite recommendation for readers interested in Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and/or art from that period. Readers who are only interested in the Crisis may be surprised to learn a lot more than they expect, as well.  Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer 12/11/2006   4.5-Books on WUAT = S-Stars on Amazo 
 Veteran Hercule Pirot mystery reader Hugh Fraser once again lends his smooth and clear voice to another Agatha Christie mystery, CARDS ON THE TABLE.Dinner and bridge turns into a murder investigation for Hercule, whose host has suddenly died. Three other detectives at the table also investigate, so plenty of expertise abounds here. 
 The best buy I have done since long time.. a hands on tool for hospitality and restaurant professionals.. Packed of tips, hints and the Truth.. I have started using some examples while still reading this book. I think a must  for every manager and boss in this industry.. I learned a lot and opened my  eyes again, remembered things forgotten and implemented tricks from the  book.. this book is every cent worth spent.. And fun reading too 
  This film is an artfully crafted vision of the old west.    By any measure one of John Wayne's better movies.   I really can't feature this movie being made with anyone else in the lead.  He fits the character like a glove as a tough gnarled and aging rancher.  Roscoe Brown is another inspired piece of casting as the sagely cook.  His was a Oscar caliber performance.  In my book, this picture has Bruce Dern's best performance as an evil doer.  His psychopathic rustler is a flawless jewel.  And despite these excellent qualities what really makes this film so good and sets it apart is it's concept-    Cowboys herding cattle that are really boys, facing the harsh unforgiving environment of the old west and dealing with it as best they can.  Casting the cowboys they used a mix of Hollywood child actors and kids that grew up on ranches and had riding and roping skills.  This worked out incredibly well.  The script is tight and the movie does not have one flabby moment.  To top it off- the musical score is by John Williams.  All of these things converge to create a perfect gem of filmmaking. 
 I loved this album very much.. the first single is awesome, sounds very rockish. The rest of the album is also very nice, it's kinda similar to their last album which is also very well put together.. I think all the oreja fans will like it.. And for those of you just getting into them it's a great way to be introduced to this great band. Love 
 Stargate Atlantis is in my opinion, the best Scifi show out there.  The look and feel of the show is amazing, and the characters have depth and appeal.  Remember to watch the show LIVE in the U.S. too, that's the only way the ratings will count!  Remember, we have to keep the ratings up to get the show renewed for further seasons 
 Again, another spectacular season.  The pairing of comedy with heartfelt observations is quite a combination.  Having the whole season in one place is a great way to watch the characters develop and you can really see what the writers are trying to do here to tie the whole show together.  The cast is amazingly funny.  You can tell they have ridiculous amounts of fun filming this show.  Watching JD and Turk re-unite after Turk's been away on his honeymoon is nothing short of hysterical!  When Eliot goes on an interview for a fellowship position, I thought I was going to pull a muscle!  Funny, funny, funny, funny stuff. Highly recommended 
 This product is pretty much what I expected.  The latex is a little dusty looking--not a clean crisp red at all.  However, it gets the job done for those pilates exercises 
 I have always liked CKY. Although not as heavy as there first CD, this is more detailed and refined. It has great catchy tunes with awesome guitar punch lines. I think the lyrics are expertly crafted, the way they are thrown together is great. It's like watching a perfect movie where the plot never dulls, and the dialogue never gets cheesy. Nice hard hitting downstroking and throaty lead guitaring. Whatever. Rock on. 5 star 
 I always wondered what happened during winter - how does so much spring forth in springtime when its so quiet over the winter.  This book gives us a terrific foundation for understanding all that.  There are chapters on trees and what's going on inside them, "winter weeds," insects and how they overwinter in their different forms, and mammals and what they're doing to survive.  Its just so absolutely amazing.  There are activities throughout the book as well so it doesn't need to be just a nice winter read but a nice chance to get outside and explore too 
 Tom Peters does not only preach innovation, he lives it. This book is a prime example... its unique style and content make it a fast read, but the ideas presented stimulate many fresh thoughts that keep you thinking long after you finished reading the book.  Definitely worth reading... 
 Richard Cheese makes the kind of music that you'll want to enjoy once or twice, tap your foot along with, nod your head, then put it on the CD shelf to get dusty. "Hot for the Teacher," is a notable standout, with Dick really going to town with the whole big band.  On each song, Cheese's rich voice and crazy piano solos make them worthwhile.  Each note he sings is sustained with that powerful and suave lounge groove.  If this kind of satire has to be made, its good that it was made by Richard Cheese 
 David Fromkin's "A Peace to End All Peace" is a wondefully researched and well-written account that covers the political creation of the modern Middle East from the period starting during World War I and the years immediately subsequent to it.  Although Fromkin tackles the project in a somewhat predictable, chronological manner, his book is supremely researched and engaging thanks in part to the book's prescient subject matter.   Fromkin intertwines the events of World War I as they specifically related to the Ottoman Empire and the rest of the geographic Middle East with a more comprehensive War history.  Specifically, the author describes and explains the political machinations and intellectual movtivations on the part of the Allied leaders (specifically the British) who oversaw the prosecution of the War.  For example, the book contains a detailed account of how and why the Ottoman Empire ultimately became involved in the War on the side of Germany, thus leading to the Empire's overthrow and the subsequent contrived fracturing of the Middle East.  The book does a fantastic job of exposing the truth and debunking myths associated with controversial aspects of the war.  In doing so, Fromkin paints a panoramic picture and is equally contemptuous when describing the motivations of all parties involved.    Though the book is both intensely well researched and covers a topic concededly enormous, there were certain elements of the topic the book espouses to cover that could and should have garnered more attention.  For example, an obvious and extremely important movement related to the modern geo-politics of the region was the birth of Zionism in the late-1800's and its rise during World War I.  This topic was casually glossed over by Fromkin.  As is well known, British leaders during the period concluded that promoting Palestine as a homeland for the Jews scattered throughout the world, and especially in oppressive regions such as Russia, would generate support for the Allies thus hastening a more rapid conclusion to the War.  Furthermore, the British believed that if Palestine could effectively be established as the homeland for the Jews, British influence would form an unbroken chain between Eastern Africa and India.  While Fromkin repeatedly discusses this latter thesis, he fails to go into any depth regarding the more subtle motivations for promoting Zionism as espoused by Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, and others who steadfastly supported the cause of the Jews.    Overall, David Fromkin has written a fantastic account and has demonstrated both a supreme grasp of the subject and impeccably sharp analysis.  As stated above, however, the topic is much too expansive for each aspect of the book's subject to be appropriately covered in only 550+ pages.     
 Malphurs provides the experienced and emerging leader an excellent resource.  He combines the right mix of biblical advice & perspective, academic theory, and practical tools on which the Ministry leader may step up to the next level 
 I've tried all sorts of diets in my time (haven't we all?!?!), and for the first time ever I've found someone who really gets what a NORMAL person goes through to lose weight. And even more importantly - how to KEEP IT OFF!! I first picked up Karas's other book, The Business Plan for the Body, which was fantastic; the perfect nuts and bolts, no BS plan for getting yourself on the right track to lose weight. I lost 30 lbs in a little over two months and felt better than ever. But then I fell off course - you know how it goes - and started getting "busier" with work, home life, social life, and pretty much anything I could come up with as an excuse to not have the time to dedicate to staying healthy. I regained most, if not all, of the 30 pounds. But then I saw Karas on Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer talking about his new book. It has truly changed my life. The first time around, I was successful with weight loss b/c of the Business Plan, but Flip the Switch has really taught me how to make the little daily changes that, when you step back and look at them, add up to a comprehensive healthy lifestyle. Before I knew it, I re-lost the original 30 pounds, plus 15 more!! Thank you, Jim Karas, for changing my life and really teaching me how to do the little things that have changed my life forever! It's been almost a year and a half since I first started the Flip the Switch program, and I've lost a total of 45 pounds, and even more impressive, I've kept it off all this time! Thank you, Mr. Karas, you have empowered me to take control of my lifestyle, instead of just playing the victim. Thank you 
 I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN AVID READER UNTIL LAST YEAR, WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LUPUS AND ADD.  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO READ ANY FICTION BOOK WHAT-SO-EVER.

JANCE FOR A WONDERFUL READ AND A GREAT REMINDER OF HOW MUCH I LOVE SEATTLE 
 Being the author of several books on the martial arts and fighting, I am always looking for books of exceptional quality to add to my library. If I have a book in my library, it's definitely worth owning. One such book is David Kahn's, "Krav Maga."  After a brief introduction, David gives you a good basic overview of Krav Maga including some of its history. From here he goes right into a section on philosophy, which is very good, and one in which I would have to agree with about 90% of what he has to say.  The next section in the book gives a good overview on the proper mindset needed in order for you to prepare yourself for combat. Something a lot of books fail to do, but not this one. David also gives you a basic understanding of the vital/vulnerable points on the human body.  David's next section is rather brief to my liking, but still a good overview on the basic principles involved in striking correctly for maximum effect. This section covers such strikes as; punches, palm heel strikes, elbow strikes, and eye gouges. There is also a small section on blocks and parrying as it is called in boxing.  The following section covers various lower body strikes and kicks along with kick defenses, which include deflections, blocks and grabs. This next section was particularly interesting in that it discussed close combat fighting and techniques essential to this section. Such as; falling, crawling, clinching, takedowns, defenses against tackles, etc.  The escape section was very enlightening as David covered the basic principles of escape from basic grabs, chokes while standing, chokes while lying down, head locks, hair grabs, and bear hugs.  Like most books that try to cover too much in one volume, I feel that the sections themselves although very well done, tend to be too brief on the proper execution of each individual technique. However, having said that, this is to be expected as the scope of this book is intended as a basic overview of the complete system, not a single volume devoted to one particular technique.  The only fault that I have with this book is the fact that I would have preferred actual photographs for demonstrating the techniques, rather than illustrations. I felt that a lot of what David was trying to explain got lost with the use of illustrations compared to if he would have used actual photographs.  The book continues with a brief section on basic strategies, which I found to be very solid. It then finishes with a basic training section which covers stretching, training programs, a 12 week training routine, and sparring.  Overall, this is a very good basic overview on the art of Krav Maga, and one you definitely want to acquire, especially if you decide to join a Krav Maga class. And that is not a bad idea at all 
    This is by far the best single CD of '80s Heavy Metal EVER released!  It not only features the best bands of the '80s, it also features their best songs.  All of the top bands are here (Ratt, Poison, Quiet Riot, Scorpions) and these songs are the best they had to offer.  The only changes I would have made are instead of featuring Whitesnake's Give Me All Your Love I would have included Still Of The Night.  I love the fact that Big City Nights is on this instead of Rock You Like A Hurricane because Big City is a great, underrated tune.  The only negative comment I can make is this collection should have at least a couple of power ballads (maybe Heavan by Warrant or Poison's Every Rose Has Its Thorn) because power ballads were a big part of the reason why '80s metal bands were so popular and successful.  Also it is great that Black 'N Blue's Hold On To 18 is here because it is a great song, and they were a very underrated and talenetd band.  Overall a fantastic collection and a wonderful introduction to anyone who would like to find out more about '80s Heavy Metal.  Get This!!! 
 I liked this book because it was a very simple story, but one that kept me hoping for the best for these people. It was sweet and sad at times but kept my interest until the very last page. A good story, simply stated 
 I cranked through this book in about 4 days.  It was difficult to put down.  The author, on account of her family connections, obviously had a passion for telling this story and that passion came through in the pages of this book.  The thing I appreciated most about the book--aside from its riveting subject matter--was that the author presented a very balanced and objective account of the tragedy.  She did not try to blame the mining company, the mine bosses, the cage operators or the politicians for the tragedy.  I did not sense any underlying agenda except to tell the story of these men and their families.  That was refreshing.  She actually seemed somewhat sympathetic to all involved and seemed to give them all the benefit of the doubt.  Again, very refreshing.  The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because--for reasons that I cannot put my finger on--I was not quite as impressed with this book as I was two other disaster accounts I have read recently, Dark Tide (Great Molasses Flood in Boston) and Ship Ablaze (General Slocum disaster in East River), both of which I rated 5 stars (and highly recommend) 
 This book is exceptional and a must for anyone pursuing this area of interest. The only disappointment I had in purchasing this item is that it is supposed to come with a CD, and the CD was never shipped to me. What's up, Amazon? 
 This book helped me to give a talk to a Christian Youth Group of the spirituality of God and how it relates to the greatest Superhero of all, Superman. Its a fun and easy read and is recommended to anyone who is interested in seeing the ties between Superman and our christian value 
 This book has been a huge help in training my new puppy. It not only teaches you how to trian your dog but also how your dog's mind works, how to solve problems and how to "read your dog."  All in all, a great book for the beginning dog owner/trainer.  The only down side is that a large portion of the material later in the book is focused on training for a show or competition dog, not something the average dog owner really needs to know 
 This novel is almost a segue for Puzo.  It introduces a new story, with the help of well known plot lines and characters, namely Michael Corleone being "exiled" in Sicily.  Although the novel has very little to do with the Corleone family, it is a fantastic story, and very well written. Through a clever plot, the reader constantly wonders who the "bad guys" are.  The reader is likely to flip flop several times, which makes the novel excellent for group discussion.  In any case, I'd give the story 5-stars, and the writing 3 1/2 stars.  Although the story is fantastic, Puzo often relies on cliche terms and phrases, which drag on the story in my opinion.  However, it is a must read for any Puzo/Godfather fan, and a great stepping stone into his other novel 
 As Sam Fink tells the reader in his forward:  "For as long as I can remember, every Fourth of July The New York Times reproduced a copy of the original Declaration of Independence on the back page.  Each time it appeared, I would look it over with admiration and go out to celebrate..."  "A couple of years ago, I thought I would actually try to read it...  Reading it over several times, enjoying it more and more, I became very impressed with Thomas Jefferson's logic.  I liked his argument of how unfairly the colonies were being treated, how they couldn't stand it anymore, and they needed to break away from Great Britain.  So, I planned a project..."  And that project became this book, The Declaration of Independence:  The Words That Made America.  Mr Fink has taken the document apart, dividing it into short, more easily understood phrases.  Each two-page spread features one beautifully, hand lettered phrase, accompanied by a clever and engaging illustration of its meaning.  It's the captivating artwork, rich in historical detail and playful wit, that really brings the significance of these great words to life.  Mr Fink also includes the complete text of the Declaration, informative chronology "that transformed loyal subjects of Great Britain into rebellious, patriotic Americans," a comprehensive glossary, selected bibliography and resources, and index at the end, to further explain and enlighten.   Perfect for youngsters 10 and older, The Declaration Of Independence is a marvelously evocative experience that both inspires and captures the imagination, and is most definitely one of the best new books of 2002.  "The words that made America can now be shared with people of all ages;  and they can help us understand what the Founding Fathers created for all of us who have followed.  Freedom...oh, sweet freedom.&quot 
 This adventure and fantastic book is about a boy named Bud. He lived in a Foster home. After Bud went through cruel treatment at a home, he decides to runaway and go to who he thinks is his dad. This is an amazing story with a surprise twist in the end 
 As a radio host of a health talk show, I see many health books cross my desk.  This one is the best of the best in my opinion. Dr. Plasker gives a lot of great information in an easy to read format that can be utilized easily by the reader. I especially like the section of his book that talks about an individuals family risk factors, such as diabetes or heart disease and then goes on to give advice as to how someone with those risks can avoid becoming a statistic.   I really feel that anyone who wants to live a healthy life is doing themselves a service to utilize this book 
 I recently got a waffle iron, but the recipe included with the appliance was disappointing to say the least.  I borrowed this book from the library because I have been very pleased with German's bread machine books and  thought I would test some of the recipes to see if the book was worth  adding to my collection.  I shouldn't have worried!  I could have bought it  outright and saved myself a little time!  We have tried the Sweet Butter  Waffles (they are as heavenly as they sound) and the Peanut Butter Waffles  (also very yummy and popular with the kids as well).  In addition to the  fabulous recipes, German also gives detailed information on waffle making  in general (how much batter to use, how to tell when the waffle is done,  etc.) and how to adapt recipes if you want to make pancakes instead.  She  even gives you "permission" to just mix everything together at  once if you don't want to take the time to separate the egg (and I can tell  you from personal experience, the results are just as delicious!) If you  love waffles, or if you've always wanted to make them but were too chicken  to try, this is the book for you 
  A valuble source of information at your finger tips, with up to the date prices for all watches. I would have to say, "a Bible for the watch collector" 
 I came to the album after seeing a late night rock show (jet lag  just after returning to the States from many years in East Asia) in which Emmy was singing and Daniel Lanois was playing the guitar, performing live together somewhere.    Together on that show they really blew me away.  I remembered Emmy as a country standard from many years before.  Then she had brown hair, and now she had grey hair. And I did not know who Daniel Lanois was.  Since I had just come back from overseas I thought something big had happened in the music world that I had missed out on.  Later I came to realize to my regret that this was something of a one'fer.  Popular music is still junky.  The fusion of country heart and rock vibe is still mostly fake, and I have not seen either of these two artists play live alone or anywhere together again since that time.    And this album, which I bought in 2000, is the only record I have of their collaboration.  This realization is also part of my education as to how things are.   This should not be missed. Everyone in it is a big act, and doing something special and talking from the heart 
 No one in a design/manufacturing environment could operate and keep their job with the numbers that sales and marketing accept every day.  My team and I have been working on eliminating the waste in sales and marketing for over 15 years. We have used many of the six sigma approaches to dramatically improve the flow of product ( sales) from the raw materials (prospects/leads). What a treasure for Michael to have written this book. He is stating what really works.   If you buy one book on sales this year - make it this on 
 I just finished Midnight Sun and it was heart-breaking when I read the last page and knew that I would never know what further happened to Karl,Elsa, James, Kaatje, Tora and Trent.  I would have appreciated a  longer epilogue, maybe, and less time on Soren, but overall I thoroughly  enjoyed this trilogy 
 Last month, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment released the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD. This is not the first time the classic trilogy has been released to the DVD market. In 2004, released the Star Wars trilogy gift set, complete with commentary tracks for each movie and a bonus features disc. But there was a huge outcry from many "purists" among the Star Wars fans clamoring for the films on DVD. These films were not the original theatrical versions of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi released in 1977, 1980 and 1983, respectively. These weren't even the Special Edition versions released in 1997 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the original film. No, it seems that George Lucas ans his crew at Lucasfilm, Ltd. had further enhanced the films, both touching up on the special effects and bringing in actors from the prequel films to make these movies flow more smoothly with the newer films.   During the fall of 2005, Fox issued a three DVD set which contained the Star Wars films, minus the bonus features disc and with some different artwork for the slipcase. But that was not enough to placate the purists who continued to demand the release of the original theatrical versions of the films on DVD. Lucas had publically expressed his reluctance to do so, and stated repeatedly that the newer, enhanced versions were the definitive versions of the story.   Finally, in May of this year, Fox and Lucasfilm announced that the original versions of the films from the classic trilogy would be released to the DVD market on September 12th. Each movie has been released as a two-disc set, containing both the enhanced and original versions. The discs containing the enhanced version (Disc One) also contains the commentary tracks recorded for the original DVD set. The video and sound quality is not the same as the newer versions. Jim Ward, a spokesman for Lucasfilm commented "It is state of the art, as of 1993, and that's not as good as state of the art 2006." These DVD's are available only for a limited time before they are pulled off the market on December 31st.   So, do you prefer Han shooting first, or Greedo? Ian McDiarmid or Clive Revill as the Emperor? Temeura Morrison's voice or Jeremy Bulloch's for Boba Fett? Sebastian Shaw or Hayden Christiansen as the redeemed Anakin Skywalker? Do any of these things really matter? Does anyone with a life really care?   In all seriousness, it would been so much better for Fox and Lucasfilm to have just made the original theatrical versions availble by themselves rather than using this two-disc set to shove the newer versions down the throats of fans who just wanted to buy the originals. I would mainly recommend these DVD's for those purists absolutely have to have the original theatrical versions, or for someone who is such an avid Star Wars fan collector that he has to have anything and everything with Star Wars on it. Otherwise, I'm really not sure it's worth the $29.90 price tag on each DVD set.    
 The most atypical of Patrick Hamilton's novels (and perhaps the most beloved), THE SLAVES OF SOLITUDE takes place in a suburban boarding house in 1943 where the heroine Miss Roach--intelligent, lonely, and on the cusp of middle age--has moved to escape the dangers of the Blitz. Commuting from the publishing house where she reads manucsripts in London, she spends her nights wandering the deserted unlighted streets, necking in parks with American soldiers, and being bullied at dinner by the sly and pompous autocrat of the dining room, Mr. Thwaites, another lodger at the Rosamund Tearoom where most of the action is set. This beautifully constructed little novel perfectly captures the mood of its time. It also anticipates the fascination with the alienation common among shabby-genteel boarding houses and pension-hotels that emblematizes the dilapidated middle-class culture of the UK in the twenty-five years after the war (as in Terrence Rattigan's SEPARATE TABLES or Elizabeth Taylor's MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT). The novel is in many ways exploring the nature of war itself on a figurative level, but it also first and foremost a comedy. Miss Roach's boarding-house nemeses, the sinister and German-born Vicki Kugelmann and the splenetic Mr. Thwaites, are so memorably awful and unpleasant they win the reader's heart immediately; Mr. Thwaites, in particular, is so beautifully drawn as to equal the best comic secondary creations of Dickens or Austen. The novel touches upon all kinds of tricky ideas about paranoia and consciousness that a clever reader might be interested in teasing out further, but simply as a comedy of manners this novel is a pure tonic 
 I'm so psyched that BOB & TOM decided to release their Greatest Hits album in stores nationwide. This is just as funny as Adam Sandler and Cheech & Chong, fans of the show will recognize some classic comedy  tracks such as "Dear Penthouse," "Dicken's Cider," and  "Prisoner of Love!" You don't have to be a fan of the show to get  this, although it might help just a little 
 The author did a lot of work in writing this book.  His research was accurate but his findings were often off the mark because he just didn't understand some of the nuances.  He painstakingly went over all the data, included accurate quotes, and came to mostly accurate conclusions.  Unfortunately, some of his conclusions missed the mark.  A good effort.  He should be congratulated for his effort if not for his conclusions 
 Mr. Lawhon found the answers to the questions I have been asking.  What is a customer? What is the difference between a successful and less than successful salesperson?  It is  clear that he cares about retail selling and truly is there to help.  This book as well as the selling bible are a must read for everyone in the business of selling no matter what you sell!!!!!!! 
 After trying to learn clawhammer for 12 months and buying almost every book and video known to mankind, I saw an advert for this book and CD rom and bought both. How I wish that I`d bought this book first.I would have never needed another. It teaches from the very basics. It lets you learn one thing before it goes into the next and makes everything fun. You learn almost without knowing it. It not only teaches new tunes but makes the tunes you already know, come together. Even the cord shapes seem easier. I can`t thank them enough 
 This is the third in Simmons' hard-boiled series of Joe Kurtz books, and it's another winner.  It's a little more predictable than the first two (not surprising with later series entries), but still a good read-- and we now know who Kurtz's father is (or we do if we are fans of Richard Stark).   I'm used to noir heroes getting beat up and abused: Philip Marlowe and the Continental Op and Travis McGee and every two-bit gumshoe gets pummelled into unconsciousness or winged by a gat or tortured unmercifully on every other case.  But Simmons is REALLY cruel to Kurtz. In every book, he's so abused you just wanna tell him to sit down and have a beer and watch Oprah and recover a little.  Hell, I thought he was pretty much dead at the end of the second book.  Now, here he is, back again.  Ten pages in, though, he's pretty much dead again.  Simmons: Give Kurtz a break!  Simmons is always worth reading-- if you've read the first two Kurtzes, you'll want to read this one 
 Absorbing book! My concern is the very poor customer service of Amazon.com. So far I have been unable to reach anyone at Amazon.com, so will use any venue I can to express my disappointment. I tell everyone I meet about Amazon.com's poor customer service and suggest they shop elsewhere.  
 Since so many able reviewers have provided insightful and lengthy reviews of this book, I shall keep my comments short.  This book, to put it simply, should be THE starting point for any and all who question or wish to think about the doctrines of (primarily) Christianity, though the discussion of the Old Testament clearly has relevance to Judaism, too. Paine makes an assault on these religions, and utterly rejects their holy books and doctrines, because he sees them as horribly divergent from what a rational conception of God requires. Paine explicitly advocates Deism, but the arguments he makes are equally useful to atheists, agnostics, theists, and all others interested in religion.   These arguments may not be accepted as decisive by all, but they will indubitably cause any open-minded individual to seriously consider them. This is simply one of those books that anybody who seriously considers the philosophy of religion must read 
 I thought that this is supposed to be a forum for book reviews, not personal attacks! Suzy Q doesn't know what the heck she is talking about. I lived in Santa Fe and worked for Harry and Peyton for over a year and know that they treat all of their staff, hispanic and white, like family.  And the reason that I even found this cookbook was because I miss their food so much, that I have periodically done searches to see if they have a website yet to email Peyton and ask for recipes.  If the book is beautiful it is because they do things well and have good friends who do things well.  I anticipate it to be a reflection of the warm and quirky, yummy eating experience that Harry's is and I can't wait to recieve my copy in the mail.  Suzy Q wouldn't know something special if it hit her in the head.  
 My 2 1/2 year old can.  I personally don't see the attraction to any of the Bob the Builder videos, but we watch this one every Friday Night.  There is something about how Bob shouts "we won!" that really appeals to my son.  I'm glad the stories are now being released on DVD and this one is more enjoyable than Pets in the Pickle 
 My 2 year old son has all the Bob movies, and we got this one for him just before Christmas. Its good, but not as good at the three that came before this one. It seems a little bit of a knock off, as not all the segments have anything to do with Christmas, but my son loves it, so we watch it, and watch it, and watch it.. 
 I met Ms. Holt in ... (basis for her fictional town of Moon).  She is like her characters...down-to-earth, witty, and honest.  As a twenty-seven year old teacher, I read this novel for three reasons: its setting ... I've read her other novels and loved them, and to find new reading material for recommendation to my students.  I was not disappointed. Jaynell and her family are easy to identify with, easy to follow, and easy to love.  The story line is not difficult and the messages ring all too true!  Pick this one up, you won't stop 'till the end 
 A unique way of telling the story of the Holocaust. The volumes tell the story of a father who was in a camp, and a son who felt he must tell what it meant. The books mean a lot to me because the Holocaust is the most horrific event in Western history. Buy these books and weep over the story of the sin behind the horror for the sin still haunts the halls of Western history 
 I have not read this book, so I gave it the average rating (4 stars).   My only question is this: If the author is so patriotic, and uses it as a litmus test for evaluating the quality of citizenship of others (see her other writings), then how can she justify being married to a guy who, when it came time to put his life on the line for the cause of patriotism, avoided military service? Perhaps even more appalling is the fact that her family will reap millions from war profiteering through their affiliation with Halliburton, with no personal sacrfice of their own.  Cheney may know about American history and be an eloquent writer about patriotism, but when it comes time to walk the walk, she is a miserable failure. Based on their family's lack of patriotism and sacrifice, we can safely say that the Cheneys will be noticeably absent from future books about American patriotism 
 In This Life Together is a phenomenal CD. From the 1st song, Thru Love to the last song Bed Time Story. This CD could easily be used as a soundtrack of the lives many young married couples. As much as the media would like to portray that love and respect does not exsist in African American relationships, Aja and Fatin are here to prove them wrong! What an honest and refreshing exchange between the two of them about life,love and growth! Thank you so much Fatin and Aja for sharing your gift with the world and giving us music we can truly identify with, from Turn it up to Sneak a freak every song on this CD is Slamming! Buy It! Dont Burn it! Lets support our own!Trust me you will not be disappointed,It will be money well spent 
 My son and his friends love the Acceleracers and waited with bated breath to see the conclusion to this series and were not disappointed.  The Hot Wheels folks had a great product on their hands here, but it must not have made money because you cannot find the cars in stores anymore, nor any of the tracks.  Thats really too bad because the little guys loved all the characters and the colorful cars.  Guess they are all collector's items now 
 I didnt know this movie was about Norman Lindsay the Australian artist and brother of author Jack Lindsay.  I used to collect Norman Lindsay -- still have some of his printed pictures.  This is a lovely film with two of my favorite stars.  The nudity is attractive especially as there is no sex to speak of.  It is a confrontation between good and evil -- or perhaps a questioning of the meaning of "good" and "evil".  Look for the snake who precedes Taras goings about -- especially as it glides toward the ship of her and hubby Hughs voyage home.  
 This is a good webcam for a first timer (which i am)altough the camera sends the sound b4 the picture so its not excactly in sync all the time 
 In many ways, "Shutter Island" is a typical Dennis Lehane book, and in many other ways, it isn't. If you have read other books by this author, you'll notice the easy yet hard, dry style of narrative, the complex characters with lots of skeletons in their closets, the seemingly impossible investigation and the brilliant descriptions of places that come alive in the readers' minds.   On the other hand, this time nothing is what it seems. For example, in the Kenzie/Gennaro series, there are many plot twists, but all of them are based on reality, on characters' motivations and actions. But on Shutter Island anything can happen, because it's a prison for the most dangerous and crazy psycopaths in the country.   Sheriffs Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule arrive on Shutter Island on the eve of a tremendous hurricane storm, in order to find Rachel Solando, a woman who has murdered her three children. Rachel was able to get out of her locked cell, past a bunch of guards and has disappeared in the island. As Teddy and Chuck try to find out what happened to the lost woman, they get to know the doctors, servants, guards and even pacients of the place. With terrible secrets connecting their past lives with the present in Shutter Island, Teddy and Chuck don't know if, as the time passes and they unfold what's really happening at the island, they could get saner or crazier.   Dennis Lehane's departures from his famous Kenzie/Gennaro series - like "Mystic River" - are always welcome, as the author keeps writing in his usual dry, compelling style, creating interesting characters and a complex tale where nobody knows what the truth is.   Another good book by Lehane. 
 It's that simple. These two star-crossed 'Cosmic Mates' are among the most intriguing Rock couples of those long ago 1960's. I bought this book as a Doors fan. I would have enjoyed it anyhow. Patricia Butler adds some interesting previously unknown details about Pamela and Jim Morrison-especially Pam. She mentions in the book that she had received so much information-too much to include in the book. I was left wanting more and I hope she writes another one. I have to add that I would love to see that footage of Pam and Jim cavorting in a Moroccan (if memory serves) cemetery. I wish the executors of Jim and Pamela Morrison's estates would let their fans see it. As well as other footage. One day maybe. Anyway one thing is very clear to me. Jim loved Pam. Pam loved Jim. They were meant for each other and I like to think of them together forever in the 'ether' as Ray has phrased it. Heaven I mean. Peace and Love. : 
 The book includes explanations of why the photographer went with the approach they did (including the dead-honest "I only had five minutes to set up" in a couple cases).  It shows diagram layouts of what lights were used at what angles, which is excellent for learning what the basic layouts are, and giving you a leg up if you want to shoot a portrait and are thinking about how to approach it.    And best of all, it's not all HIS photographs.  Most books suffer badly under the weight of a single photographer trying to demonstrate something.  By definition, every photographer has a style, and in any "one photographer" book you're going to get a ton about shooting in THEIR style, but almost no diversity of approaches abd styles.  That diversity is important in learning the principles that let you develop YOUR OWN style.  That's great for booksellers, since you probably have to digest 10-15 books to get enough range to have a sense of what's possible.  (Assuming there are 10-15 books that are good - and my bookshelf suggests there aren't.)  As to "not useful for social photography portraits" - if you're looking to shoot school portraits, or families in front of the same backdrops, that's probably true.  But if you're looking to do creative portraits with some sizzle and style and snap to them, this book has many examples that you could go duplicate right away.  And it'll give you the raw material ideas to come up with 20 other approaches.  The best of the 10 "lighting for..." books on my shelf - more content than all the other 9 put together 
 I've been wanting to try Spirulina, the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by, and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so. The bar is a medium sized green rectangle. It smells interesting and is very moist and chewy. I'm not a big fan of sour foods, so I didn't like that it tasted a bit sour. My [...] brother however LOVED this bar more than all the others we tried. Has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats. VERY FILLING! Overall if you like sour and sweet, this bar is for you 
 Very informative book about the Teutuls. I am a big fan of OCC. I'm willing to pay that price. Even it's overpriced 
 IF YOU LIKE SEAGAL'S MARTIAL ARTS AND LOTS OF BAD GUY CRUNCHING, YOU'LL LIKE THIS MOVIE... MANY POOR REVIEWS, AND I WONDER WHY... THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST NIT PICKING.... IT'S A MOVIE, WHICH IS MEANT TO ENTERTAIN... DON'T DISSECT IT, JUST WATCH & ENJOY... WORTH THE DVD, DEFINITEL 
 Ward Just is a writer with few equals. He wrote for the Washington Post for many years, most notably as a Vietnam reporter in the seventies. Just successfully made the transition to fiction and hasn't turned back in some three decades.  An Unfinished Season is an exceedingly well crafted novel, set in Eisenhower era Chicago. The narrative is exact in the details it reveals, yet still spare enough to leave a reader guessing.  The reader is offered a rare inside glimpse of the North Shore W.A.S.P.s of Chicago, frozen in some ways like the cold midwest they inhabit. And frozen like the mysterious poor woman who appears throughout the book.  This is something of a coming of age novel, for both the main character, Wilson Ravan, and his father, Teddy Ravan. Wilson Ravan's unfinished season is the period after high school and before college - he's gotten a day job of sorts at a Chicago newspaper. It's here that he gleans the smutty stories he tells at the debutante balls he attends in the evenings. He experiences his first love and his first heartache.  Teddy Ravan's unfinished season is the end of his middle age years and possibly of his marriage - the reader never really finds out if the marriage is ending, or just settling in for the long haul to the twilight of the couple's years.  This novel is so tightly woven, it's difficult to dissect - and even after finishing it, one can't be sure of it. The reader is never completely let in, which is just as telling as what is learned. Just's prose is deeply symbolic without being corny.  This is a quiet, thoughtful book - highly recommended. A beautiful piece of work, and an affirmation of why I read fiction 
 Erle Stanley Gardner is best known for creating the archetype of the good lawyer in the series of novels starring his character Perry Mason, who was featured in a number of films in the 1930s played by Warren William and others, but was most famously portrayed by Raymond Burr in the popular television drama that ran for nine seasons on CBS and that thrives in syndication to this day. (Did you know that Gardner himself played a judge in the final episode?)   What most people don't know is that he also wrote another series of novels, under the pseudonym A.A. Fair, featuring the investigation team of Bertha Cool and Donald Lam. The Cool and Lam books numbered 29 and were published between 1939 and 1970, around the same time that Gardner was writing the Mason novels. Though Top of the Heap is the thirteenth in the series, it also serves as a fine introduction to the characters, though mostly Lam, as the legman, is featured.   When John Carver Billings ('"The Second," he amended.') enters the offices of Cool and Lam, asking for the "senior partner," Donald Lam sits back and waits for the sparks to fly, since that title refers to Bertha Cool and Billings doesn't appear to be the kind of guy who will accept a woman as a detective. But when Bertha calmly calls Donald into her office, sans explosion, he knows there must be a lot of money involved. Billings is looking for someone to corroborate his whereabouts of the previous Tuesday night and is willing to pay for the privilege, but what seems like a simple job -- with a five-hundred-dollar bonus attached -- turns into something entirely other when Donald actually does some investigation and discovers that Billings has other things on his mind besides his innocence.   Of course, the more Lam investigates, the more he uncovers, eventually angering both Billings and Bertha. Speaking of, extreme detective characters like Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe -- and now the foul-mouthed, greedy, ungrateful, jumping-to-conclusions charmer Bertha Cool -- are best taken in small doses. Some entries of the series are reported to focus more on her but Top of the Heap offers just enough for us to still find her amusing without crossing over into annoyance. It's the sidekick/legman character: Doctor Watson and Archie Goodwin -- and Donald Lam -- that we're supposed to identify with, anyway.   I was pleasantly surprised at how Gardner made the story intriguingly complicated but managed to keep it understandable. I never really got into his Perry Mason novels (I wanted them to be as tightly-written as the TV shows), but I'll definitely be on the lookout for more of the Cool and Lam series. (Maybe Hard Case Crime can issue more entries? Hint, hint.) The cover picture (and tagline, for that matter) doesn't have much at all to do with the story, but it's certainly beautiful work and in any case, this is another terrific offering from this new imprint. It's almost too much to ask that they keep up this level of quality, but I only expect more greatness to come. 
 These are great books for the 8-10 year old girl.  My daughter does not like to read and yet this series has captured her imagination and kept her engrossed for long periods.  Well meaning topics and fun reading for kids 
 This may well be the best album that no one knows about. Don't worry though, within a year, many people in the U.S. will have heard a song or two from these guys. Nine Black Alps are from Manchester, UK and have earned the nickname of the Nirvana of Europe. I do and don't agree with that comparison. You can tell that they draw from Nirvana's style but NBA has a distinct sound of their own.   1.  Get Your Guns- This one rocks out from the start. I really like the verses of this one, more so than the chorus which is rather plain. Nice opener. 7.5/10  2. Cosmopolitan- This one starts with an Interpol-ish sound and then transforms into a rocking out song. The lyrics are very interesting, "You're not pretty enough, you're not skinny enough, you're not healthy enough, you're not shaking at our touch." This is referring to the mass media and how they make everyone feel inadequate about themselves. A solid song. 8/10. 3. Not Everyone- One of my favorites. This one reminds me of a Sonic Youth song which is definitely a plus. This song really comes together and builds up to the awesome chorus. 9/10  4. Unsatisfied- Hands down my favorite song on the album. The opening guitar sends chills down my spine everytime I hear it. I can't say enough about this song. To me, this one stands out above the others on the track. As lead singer Sam Forrest sings, "Ten out of ten for a race already run.." Yea... this one is definitely 10/10.  5. Headlights- Good song. I never skip it when I listen but then again, I'm never really excited when it comes on either. 7/10  6. Behind Your Eyes- A really pretty acoustic song which is a nice way to change up the album. "If that's the way you feel, there's no easy way out." I really like this one. 8.5/10  7. Ironside- Definitely my second favorite track. The guitar is incredible in this one and the singer conveys how he just wants to be left alone after a relationship falls apart. 9.5/10  8. Shot Down- I've found out that this is a fan favorite. An older sounding song which I like quite a bit. 8/10  9. Just Friends- The lead singer Forrest singing about how he is always too late and never around to start a relationship with this girl. Short and Sweet. 8/10  10. Everybody Is- Pretty good. Somewhat of an angry song. Nothing spectacular, but again, I definitely don't skip it. 7.5/10  11. Intermission- The other acoustic song of the album. Not quites as good as Behind Your Eyes, but still a song that you want to hear. 8/10  12. Southern Cross- The closer for the album is a very good one. I like the singer's voice in this one as he changes keys a few times. Nice way to finish out a great debut. 8.5/10   These guys are not known now, but they will be. Just as UK bands such as Franz Ferdinand, Coldplay, Bloc Party, and Keane have swept through America, Nine Black Alps will soon be more than a band known only in Europe.  Overall, Everything Is = 8.3/10   
 This CD is a learning tool, not a concert.  It's an excellent way for both children and adults to learn the basic traditional songs that every Jew should know, as well as a few new ones, such as Hashkediya, "The Almond Tree," for Tu B'Shevat.  Most of the tunes will be familiar, although the version of "Hiney MaTov" on this CD is a more peppy, Israel-sounding tune, rather than the one we sang in summer camp years ago.  Frankly, I like this one better.   Bikel introduces each section with a short narrative, then sings the songs clearly, with simple guitar accompanyment.  Most of the songs have both Hebrew and English lyrics.  For people who don't speak Hebrew, this is a great help for getting the "feel" or "spirit" of a song.  There's even a Purim ballad entirely in English. (I know, I know -- all Jews SHOULD know Hebrew.  But a lot don't.  Then there are people who just aren't good at languages.  Our ancestors in Eastern Europe sang in Yiddish, which was their everyday language.  So nu?  Why can't American Jews sing in English?)  One minor annoyance is that the songs are not numbered on the cover of the CD.  This makes it hard to go directly to a  specific holiday if you are doing a class.  On the plus side, the CD comes with a very nice booklet (where the songs ARE numbered) that has all the Hebrew lyrics transliterated into English spelling, as well as the English lyrics.   
 I've read many of Vonnegut's books over the past few years and I have to say that this is easily his greatest work.  It contains a gripping tale about a protagonist that is stuck in a world that is almost certainly doomed to fail.  Along the way there are many interesting thoughts expressed and funny moments 
 Having worked for IMPAX for over six years, I've had a chance to learn and work around numerous sales training methodologies before and since.   Mark Shonka and Dan Kosch present a detailed step-by-step how to approach for understanding the customer's point of view, getting credit for what you know about them, and leveraging that knowledge to communicate your value in the customer's terms. Many other so-called "sales processes" from sales training companies fall short for several reasons, and this book fills many of those gaps:   1) Many so-called "sales processes" simply present ways of analyzing customer situations (such as Miller Heiman's 'Blue Sheet'). They do not show HOW to accomplish your objectives in an account situation as Kosch and Shonka do.   2) Other "sales processes" (such as Solution Selling or SPIN Selling) get tangled up in complex questioning processes that can be difficult to master in the field. I'm not saying there is no value in them (some of these offer techniques for prospecting or demonstrating that IMPAX does not address). What I'm saying is their complexity makes them somewhat unwieldy to implement by many salespeople so they can be less than totally effective.   3) Finally, many other sales processes from training companies make a dubious assumption: that everything the salesperson does should be calculated to close the deal. I hate it when salespeople do that to me, and you probably do too.   Some environments are more opportunity focused than relationship focused, but certainly building relationships is a critical component of any selling environment. IMPAX provides step-by-step approaches for doing that, so that when qualified opportunities arise you can leverage the relationships you have built. It provides the context in which you can be recognized for the value you truly offer, and close deals based on a wider context and on future value potential, rather than (inadvertently) forcing salespeople into "peddler mode," constantly conniving to close (perhaps when prospects are not yet ready).     4) One of the most valuable things about the IMPAX Process is that while speaking the language of practical tactics salespeople love, Shonka and Kosch are really teaching salespeople a powerful strategy that can be scaled from telesales to Global Account Management to talking to your five year old.   IMPAX may not be the only thing you'll need to make your sales organization more successful, because selling skills are just one of many factors at play. However, as far as selling skills go, especially for complex B2B environments, IMPAX has a lot to offer.   Michael Web 
 I got this CD last year at the Musicology Concert and it is well worth the $50 -- 
 Well, I first heard about this film while searching for a smallville season boxset and clicked on the link to films Michael Rosenbaum had starred in and thought it looked funny. (Also I am curoius as to why Rosenbaum seems to like dressing up as women as I recently discovered he also wore women's clothes in Sweet November! I think he must have a fetish! LOL) So when I was at my local DVD rental shop I decided to see if it was worth a look... well it was! I was literally rolling about the floor laughing my head off! In short it's about 3 guys who get kicked out of their house and the only way to get back in is to join the D.O.G house by dressing as women.  For ones who say it's sexist it isn't! I actually found that it taught a lesson to males out there to be much nicer to women and respect them but this film does it in a funny way which is good! I especially thought Michael Rosenbaum was very convincing as a women and infact found it hard to take him seriously as Lex when I next watched Smallville. Sure this film is full of crude male jokes but that's what makes this film so hilarious, I loved every minute of this fun, silly comedy that will have tears rolling down your cheeks! The fact that the boys realise they have been soo cruel and nasty to these poor 'ugly' girls is a good lesson for such males that take that attitude of 'judging a book by it's cover.' The boys then change their attitudes when they are subjected to the same torture as these girls and basically they see how it feels to be treated like that and don't like it, so they decide to start over and treat them with respect! It's a must see for Smallville fans who like Michael Rosenbaum as it is simply ridiculously funny. For those who like a good comedy or a good laugh it is a must have! 
 This is a wonderful guide to the places Dorothy Parker lived and worked, this is not the same old information recycled. This is a great addition to the library of any fan or new reader of Mrs. Parker's work 
 Oh My Goodness! This book is the best, most amazing, enthralling, page turner that I have ever read. It could not be any more perfect!  I had never read romance before this book and MAN did it open my eyes to the genre. I love this book and the sequel rocks too! I have read the book over thirteen times! I usually do not read, but this book convinced me to change my ways! Stephenie Meyer is an amazing author and is very descriptive. Her way of writing is so unique but not hard to understand. It all flows and is a great book for all ages and all types of readers. If you have half a mind, you will read this book! Thank you for your time 
 I have found this to be a very reliable resource to understanding the cultural background of the Old Testament.  For me it gives a new, deeper meaning to the events of the Bible.  It is clearly written, and a great  book to have to begin your OT study...if you can find it 
 Rather technical, with many lovely color illustrations of the subject and techniques. This is a shwank reference for all manner of questions about restoration and reconstruction of paintings. You could learn much just from the pictures and captions.   The text itself is top-notch. Explanations are clear and complete. A wealth of footnotes and bibliography 
 Probably the best photo book I have ever seen. Excellent quality and one to keep for life. In the Netherlands it would cost be 150. Bij Amazon just a little over 80 
 I bought this book when I realized I could save a lot of money shopping for beads in the wholesale district in NYC (Broadway in the 30's) and learning a few simple closures. This book explains it all, from the tools you need to the different kinds of beads to the wire and clasps to use. It also has a rudimentary design section (just my speed!) on basic patterns and the effects they create, from "I'm off to the opera in my little black dress" to "I'm a crazy artist." There are numerous clear color illustrations and simple explanations of how to do the basics. A great first book if you're doing beading just for fun 
 This is a book for those who like to think about religion.  Whether you are an atheist or a theist the book will challenge you.  Hume arranges powerful arguments on both side of the question, and it is still a matter of scholarly debate what he really believed, however what Hume really believed is less important than the training in critical thinking he offers.  This is the kind of book that can change your lif 
 This is a thorough, accurate accounting of the tragic events at Ruby Ridge. Now that an appeals court has decided that Lon Horiuchi, the FBI sniper who killed Randy Weaver's wife Vicki, can be charged and put on trial by local prosecutors, it is more important than ever to have the background information needed to put the trial in proper context. Alan Bock's fair-minded journalistic account is the best single source for Americans who want to know what really happened and what Mr. Horiuchi's role was. Highly recommended 
 With this book, Sylvia Baker wrote one of the best books on the subject of breast cancer. It takes away the fear from surgery for those women who need to go through the process and this book offers lots of hope for the recover process. Baker herself is a breast cancer survivor and has gone through the whole ordeal. She wrote the book from the heart with the purpose of edifying and encouraging the reader, while being objective regarding the issue. The author approaches the subject systematically, but always with the concern of the individual patient in mind. This book is highly recommended for everyone who was just been diagnosed with breast cancer or who is already in the recovery stage, and it's also a great and encouraging read for loved ones of breast cancer victims as it is a very helpful book -- one of the best books on the subject out there. Because of the excellent content, this book is just simply an encouraging read for everyone 
 I was visiting O'ahu in 1999 for my first visit back after moving away as a child.  While searching the CD rack at the Bishop Museum for music that would help me 'feel' Hawaii, I suddenly realized that the music playing over the speakers was exactly what I was looking for.  The young man at the counter showed me a CD by IZ (Isreal Kamakawiwo'ole), then suggested 'E Ala E', since it was his own favorite.  I bought it, and when I got back to Utah I couldn't stop listening to it.  I now have over 100 Hawaiian CD's - mostly purchased over the internet.  I rate the quality of the music by how strongly I feel Hawaii when I listen to it, and "IZ" is one of the best.  He may have passed on - but he will always live on in the hearts of his many fans (past, present and future!) through his music 
 If not for "The Blue Album" I would have probably never became a fan of The Beatles. Back in the day-day they had virtually no influence on me whatsoever. I knew many a song from the old days of Beatle-mania, I wanna hold your hand type of stuff. I wasn't terribly impressed. Than one day I was introduced to SGT. PEPPER and ABBEY ROAD thru a friend, and I realized that there actually was a reason why The Beatles are so legendary. In my book the years 1967-1970 are the better Beatle years. More experimental, less poppish, and more.... waaaaaaaavy maaaaaan. More ROCKIN' to say the least. The red and blue albums are perfect starter packs for The Beatles. Someone managed to pick just the right songs to put on both collections. (RED is for the Beatle-maniacs, and BLUE is for the acid eating Beatle-maniacs) both were mixed just right. Sure you don't get everything, but there is far too much to ask for. You get the full versions of the stuff that you are bound to know, and if not will take to quickly and both sets are quality hits packages.  I remember when I was around 14 and decided I was gonna get myself a Beatles record. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted at first.. but one look at the track list on here, and I knew I wanted this one. I chose correctly.  The best Beatles hits pack available. 
 This book was very good on how to understand dreams, also on how to try and make your own dreams- like if you want to see into your future with your dreams- you can. I wouldn't reccomend this to any wiccan or pagan. it's for anyone really who just wants to study their dreams 
 Great enginering, design and craftmanship; works great every day; but I had to throw away a travel size "Waterpick" after 18 months, because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else. It doesn't make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part, on an equipment designed to outlast it three times 
 Previous reviewers have gone into great detail about the care and respect put into these first two deluxe reissues, but one thing I was very excited about on this particular release I haven't seen mentioned: The mono mix of this album contains the longer mix of "(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone".   I own a copy of the original vinyl mono release of this album, and have been hoping for years that Rhino would release this intriguing variation of "Stepping Stone". It's similar to the mono single mix ( previously released on the Rhino greatest hits CD ) with deleted background vocals, but the ending of the song is longer before the final fade-out. This version was heard once on the television series (in the episode where the lads disguise themselves as the 'Purple Flower Gang' to defeat a mob boss ) and only released on the mono album. I'm thrilled to finally have it on CD 
 Snorkel Hawaii The Big Island Second Edition is the current, in print version of this book. From time to time, the Amazon search engine sends people to this older, out of print version. We have tried repeatedly to correct this, but Amazon seems unable to do it. Try clicking on the authors names, and look for Snorkel Hawai The Big Island Second Edition, which is more up to date 
 This is one of my favorite DVD's in my collection. I loved the show when it was on tv. It contains two episodes on it and is a nice tribute to those brothers lost on 9/11. Too bad they did not release the entire series on DVD. The title says it all.. 
 This is a wonderful collection of Carly Simon hits and the CD sound quality is fine 
 After having seen Naomi Wolf on the Oprah show defending her book, and listening to the mothers who strongly disagreed with her point of view, I was a little apprehensive about reading "Misconceptions". I'll admit that the beginning had me rolling my eyes, wondering if Wolf would ever get to the meat of her essay, but I was suprised by how much better the book got as I read on. I think she approaches the topic with a balanced view, and never claims that she regrets or despises any of her decisions during her journey to becoming a mother. She had a difficult time of it, to be sure, but I could tell that Wolf was trying to point out what is wrong with the 'factory' type setting of the average American hospital, as well as what the alternatives are. I also appreciate that she covered aspects of motherhood other than the physical ones, such as the effect that having a baby often has on one's marriage. I definitely got the sense that she was terrifically surprised by everything she experienced regarding pregnancy and birth, and it takes a pretty strong woman to admit that the feminist ideal we thought we had won doesn't exactly stand up to a real-life application. Overall, I believe this book is a good starting point for any thinking woman who wants to be as informed as possible in the process towards motherhood 
 At long last collectors of hand colored photos have a guide. This book is well organized, with photographers being listed alphabetically, making a particular artist easy to locate. The background and regionality of each artist is discussed, with representative works and titles of each listed as well. There are full chapters each for the discussion of unknown photographers, regionality, and the conservation and preservation of hand painted photos. Particularly helpful is the 15 step guide to cleaning and restoration.  This 1/2 inch thick book is crammed full of useful information, and would have earned 5 stars except for a couple of problems. The first is the exclusion of two Western photographers. Burton Frasher, of Pomona, California, and the McCulloch Brothers of Phoenix, Arizona. Frashers Photo is an important part of CA history, and his exclusion here is a serious one. His b&w postcards are well known, and while his painted photos are less numerous, they are beautifully done and deserve mention. The McCulloch Brothers likewise did outstanding artistic work with photos of the Arizona desert, rivaling even the best work of the Bear Studios. There are also some quality control issues. Some of the photo examples did not print correctly, appear out of focus and have little colored lines around them. The paper used seems poor quality, and I felt I needed to take care in turning pages to avoid undue wrinkling. Despite these problems, I still highly recommend this book.  Very useful for collectors 
 Jed Perl is a is a cultivated guide; no surprise given his critical credentials. Like any good critic Perl is concerned to evaluate his various subjects, and while we may disagree with his opinions, he does not avoid any of the well known, or many of the lesser known figures, in the mid-twentieth century New York art world. Indeed Fairfield Porter, for me at least, a lesser figure, receives as much attention as Warhol, and that much more sympathetic.  Perl never loses contact with his context, the city of New York, or with the insitutions and individuals that add to the total of the art scene. So we have the galleries and the museums, and the menand women that ran them, crtical writing by individuals ranging from the poet Frank O'Hara, to the artists themselves, to, of course, Greenberg and Rosenberg, finally shaping the discourse of the times. And grounding much of the discussion are the philosophical positions adopted by critics and artists. All of this is presented in well written, simple language. Perl is to be congratulated on producing a first-class survey of one of the most exciting periods in twentieth century culture. 
 *contains spoilers*  Initially Anne portrays herself, or her character, as an utter victim, the book an endless string of complaints and grievances, and it's adorable. The vulnerability, sensitivity and naivete, however self-indulgent, held an unwavering grasp on my sympathies, and yielded a bunch of "i know that feeling. i don't think i've ever seen it depicted in fiction before, but i know that feeling" moments, mainly based on a paranoia of being judged harshly. The first of which being where, upon her impending arrival, she wishes the house "were a mile or two further off", and second being her concern for offending her host with her table manners. Where her sister's Wuthering Heights thrived on extrapolating an insight into social humanity to emotional extremes, Anne's Agnes Grey explores the mundane with equal revelatory impact in those few key moments.  Unfortunately the initial sweetness and humility with which she presents herself quickly fades into entitlement. I flinched when she wished she could use corporal punishment to keep the children in line, and became increasingly alienated thenceforth, as she turned towards speculating of the increased power and responsibility she deemed she deserved, rather than illuminating the suffering she endured for want of fair treatment. She no longer feared being judged harshly, merely resented it, and resentment without action is something I can't admire, and in this case is less than interesting to read about. She begins more freely using derogatory adjectives, and while I'm sure the increasing contempt with which her pupils are portrayed is not undeserved, it betrays a lack of nurturing approach on her part which no doubt contributed to her pupils' contraryness toward her.  Eventually her focus turns from wallowing in the contempt she feels for her environment to seeking respite from the oppression, and in her interest in Mr Weston to that end is where my sympathies to her return. The lonely-girl-with-a-crush story, and the embarassment with which she gradually unveils her infatuation, is adorably heartwarming/breaking.  The informality of the portions where the author narrates her own thoughts about what she's writing with the reader in mind is refreshing, although she is perhaps more unreasonably harsh on herself for crushing on the man than anyone else ever otherwise is towards her character. Even in the romantic fantasy ending she allows herself (which is cheesy, yet still endearing), she remains coldly composed, not seeking to express the depth of her true feelings even under the impunity of a marriage proposal, making the ending equally happy and tragic in my perception, although I wonder whether the author intended tragedy to be implied. 
 It appears that there is consensus on this Amazon forum -- and in most other forums -- that TGPoT doesn't fall within the realm of PKD's greatest works.  But it's still a worthwhile read for the following reasons... 1) PDK employs some tricks, that he's finely honed, to make the reader feel as disconnected from reality as the characters are.  He is so good at this that I actually felt off balance at times -- it's as if he were able to translate his mental illness, through the main character, right onto the pages of this book 2) In addition to his mental illness, PKD also instills the book's protagonist, Pete Garden, with the other troubles from which PKD suffered: alcohol and drug dependency and a patheticaly poor ability to manage relationships.  I believe the very personal nature of PKD's experiences with the problems of the main character are what make the book so well paced and delivered 3) More than any other Sci-Fi writer, PKD is willing to have his soul reflected onto every page he writes; and true to his nature, in TGPoT, PKD provides us with yet another window into his very distrubed and talented mind -- for me, this title slams home the fact that PKD is truly the Van Gogh of Sci-Fi 4) In TGPoT, PKD empowers his characters with novel and unique precognitive and telekenetic powers that enables him drive the pace of the book.  I took away 1 star because... 1) True to the pulp nature of his writing style, you can literally  feel PKD furiously typing to get to the end of the book so that he can, in a mad rush, sprint to his publisher to, just under the wire, fling the manuscript onto his harried publishers desk, then with a quick but poorly executed pivot, tear away with his ridiculously small check, only to barely make the close of his bank in a hastening effort to convert it to cash, so that he can jump in his old peice of $%&^ car and speed to the nearest bar to plunge into a bottle of rot gut and eventually drink and whore away his money, so that he is forced to start the cycle all over again with his next flash of brilliance 2) The game itself is probably the most uninspired concept I have seen PKD put to page.  He does though, use it as an effective tool for railing against capitalism (another common theme of PKD's works).  Net/net: if you like sci-fi, read it 
 ...the fact that out of 19 reviews 17 are 5star says alot about this DVD. Im not going to go off on one about this as i dont have time to (i know i'd get carried away as theres so much to comment on this) but basically i thought the Morning View Sessions were a good demonstration of Incubus live, Volume 2 is great, especially the live Cali-accoustic tracks (awesome) but this concert is unbelievable, so so good! Highlights for me are for a start seeing alot of the Crow Left of the Murder tracks live as the album is brilliant & has grown on me so much over time, but also just seeing how well Incubus can improvise & adapt their songs to sound even better live. Theres a great version of "Drive" here, but the lengthened versions of "Sick, Sad Lille world" & "A certain shade of Green" are amazing. The guitar work on "S,S L W", "Priceless" & "Pistola" is brilliant. Other greatly performed trackes include "Wish you were here" (such an anthem nowadays), "Here in my room", "Made for TV movie" (a new favourite of mine) & "Talk shows on mute". also very cool to see "Pantomine" live, its also on the bonus CD, along with a couple live tracks & a couple of non-album tracks.  im hoping to get to the Leeds festival this summer (if i can blag a ticket somehow) so very much looking forward to seeing them even if it is only for an hour! Theyre the best band in the world in my opinion.  Basically buy this if you love incubus, its the best DVD you can get of them... 
 The best written fantasy series in ages. A dark hero, credible villains, magic with mysteries, and politics with purpose all seem to fit naturally in a weel-paced, exciting story 
 I learned about this book through a special education teacher.  I have used it for the last five years, and the truth is, it's a great way to get to those kids who just can't '"get it".  It is very flexible and adaptable to each student's needs 
 This movie tells part of the story, Hollywood style, of the Woburn contamination legal saga which took place in the eighties as a wave of toxic tort lawsuits were sweeping the nation. Trichloretylene (TCE), a common de-greaser, Toluene and some other chemicals were dumped after use or leaked through pipes and other sources into the public water supply including wells around Woburn, MA. A number of plaintiffs filed suit claiming an abnormal number of leukemia and other health related issues. This movie focuses on the hardships faced by the people and their lawyers as they fought against lying employees of large companies, crafty lawyers and insensitive judges. While some of the movie is true, as is often the case with a Hollywood dramatization of so-called true events, much has been left out of the story.  For one thing, the movie fails to mention the scientific controversy over whether in fact TCE is harmful at all. Indeed, TCE was once the decafinating agent of coffee and was used in dry cleaning processes. Other communities around the country faced similar exposure to TCE with no noted adverse health effects whatsoever. While Toluene, a nasty chemical with known adverse health effects, was also involved in Woburn, this movie focuses on TCE, a chemical sometimes compared by toxicologists to have similar health effects to peanut butter and red wine.  Robert Duvall, John Travolta and William H. Macy deliver outstanding performances in this movie. And while Hollywood may have over-dramaticized certain aspects of the case, Travolta's observations during narrative over dubs about trial processes in general are insightful and largely accurate. It's a good movie, even if one side is portrayed more sympathetically than the other. But then, that's Hollywood 
  *** This comment may contain spoilers ***  The plot of the film is simple: a woman (Monica Belucci) is brutally raped by a stranger; and her boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) and ex-boyfriend (Albert Dupontel) who are best friends set out for revenge. What is crucial, the story is told backward.   The most obvious success for this film is the directing by Noe. He has crafted a nightmare that is both original and horrifying. If the inferno exists somewhere, one of its circles definitely looks like the "The Rectum" bar, and the other - like the underpass where Alex (Monica Belucci) was brutally sodomized and beaten for long nine minutes that seemed as an eternity. The pulsing score that accompanies the film contains, for the first sixty minutes, a constant 27-hertz tone specifically designed by Noé to cause nausea in the audience. It felt like someone was constantly drilling the holes in my head. The director creates the scenes of such pain and violence that makes "Natural Born Killers" look and feel like a puppet show. One of these is a scene where a man gets his head bashed in with a fire extinguisher with the camera never turned away and the sound is amplified.   The movie shocks you, and then it goes and shocks you even more when there is no violence on the screen. I broke in tears during the bedroom scene - so much love, tenderness and desire Monica and Vincent had for each other. They did not know what was ahead; I did.   In the end, one cannot help questioning the very fragile, illusory nature of happiness, how easy it is to destroy everything. Is it a blessing or curse not to know what lies ahead and not be able to change the future?   Dostoevsky said almost hundred and fifty years ago that the Beauty will save the world. I don't know. Not this world. Not during my time.  "Irreversible" is a shocking anti-violence film; one has to decide whether he or she wants to see it. I personally think it is a must see but I would not be surprised if a lot of viewers refuse.  
 This is a wonderful casserole! It makes me happy just to look at this beautiful pot, let alone cook with it! I highly recommend Le Creuset to anyone who love's to cook. It's a pot you'll have for a lifetime 
 Just finished reading a borrowed copy of 'Come Spring'.  Ordered a copy for myself (something I've never done before).  When it arrives, will read it again (again, something I have never done before).  Full of good story, history, and earthy philosophies.  Ben Ames Williams has a way of putting it all together. It takes a few chapters to get into the mood of the book, but once there, watch out 
 Radical Chic is timeless and as relevant today as when Wolfe put his politically incorrect observations down in writing. Wolfe is like a mirror of inescapable truth to those blinded by their sense of personal wisdom and charity.   Mau-Mauing the Flack Catchers captures the tidal pond where government and neighborhood activists interact.   Wolfe has the eye of a reporter mixed with the sense of story to chronicle events in a way that needs little narration.    Both should be required reading in every school of journalism and  by every public official in the land.  
 Guapo, tu si que sabes cantar , me vuelve loca el tema de Dinamita , me gustara mucho que Christian hiciera una gira por Espaa para verle cantar , adems mi prima me regalo el disco y lo escucho siempre que puedo , si fuera por mi estara todo el da con su msica! 
   I once had this friend in high school, Suzy.  She was the quiet little queen bee of ninth grade.  Her parents had no idea that she snuck out of their home every night and returned every morning with her tousled, perfect curls still in order, undetected.  Eventually her father discovered these midnight trysts and punished her by taking away her makeup for a week. I guess when you are living in a stale household, you are beautiful (and know it), and in need of some stimulation, you can always use your beauty as a weapon - just don't get caught. I loved the Virgin Suicide's character of Lux.  Here is a girl, like "Suzy" who is bored with being gorgeous and decided to use it as a weapon to save herself from her 1970's life of "Not my Girls"- style parenting.  Lux has beautiful sisters as well, but they don't have developed personalities and are more of a character in whole that sympathize with her.  Lux is the queen bee and leader of this family pack of admired beauties. As a young teenager she is discovering the power of her own sexuality.  Her curiosities about boys and the outside world away from her parent-controlled, sterile environment lead her to rebellious behavior and experimentation with the opposite sex.  Lux is one of Sofia Coppola's more shallow female creatures discovering the thrills of her own charms.  She is reminiscent of Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" in her young innocence and ability to indulge in the occasional lack of constant supervision.  Lux and her sisters are desperate for some kind of change, a catalyst, someone to rescue them from their lives after losing one sister to suicide.  They are in dire need of escape before they lose themselves in an ordinary life.  I highly recommend this movie and also suggest: the new "Marie Antoinette" if you are interested in Sofia's continued progress on the exploitation of young , sexually blooming teenage minds allowed to run wild with self-abandon.  It's easy to see Sofia's point when watching both films back to back - Dunst, as Lux or Marie Antoinette is still the same teenager-they are still using their young powers of seduction to tantalize and get what they want.  One happens to be the queen bee of her high school, the other the queen of France - nonetheless, the same desperate girl in need of affection and attention.   
 This is an awesome book! Has beautiful patterns and wonderful wearables anyone can make. Newbies should not be intimidated by it, these are pretty basic stitches for the most part.. 
 On the Black Hill is an elegantly written homage to the inelegant life of  rural Wales, a life in which no one ever strays far from the farm--there  are few opportunities and little motivation to do so. Spartan lives are  enriched by stories and gossip,  slights are never forgotten,  feuds reach  epic intensity, and bottled-up frustrations simmer till they explode.   Through rich and vivid descriptions of the minutiae of daily existence, we  come to know twin brothers Lewis and Ben Jones as they grow up and are  shaped by their family and their small community.  The townspeople become  our own friends or enemies, depending on their behavior towards the twins,  and we empathize with them as they use their limited resources to struggle  with the Big Questions which concern us all--questions of life, love,  spirituality, death, cruelty, justice, and ultimately,  happiness.   By  paring life to the bone here, Chatwin gives us a classic example of the  adage, "Less is more.&quot 
 Trimble gives careful, in-depth and complete descriptions of each tribe of the Southwest (here defined as New Mexico, Arizona, southern Utah and Colorado and southeastern California). Each tribe is studied on its own grounds except to develop linguistic and other inter-tribal connections.  Even if you are familiar with major tribes such as the Navajo, Apache and the best-known Puebloan peoples, Trimble still has a wealth of information for you.  A decade of research and a number of photographs by Trimble himself underscore the interest, depth and care he brings to this book and the tribes of his study.  An invaluable bonus at the end is Trimble's calendar of major religious ceremonies of the various tribes, a helpful vacation planning assistant 
 I just got the book this past week, but so far I'm impressed with it. It's small enough to place in a ALICE type back pack( and in your BDU trouser pockets). The water-proof pages is of course a plus to have in the field.   Hoo-ah!  
 Fukuyama has produced one of the most thoughtful responses to current U.S. foreign policy that exists today.  America at the Crossroads is a wonderful collection of several different topics, woven together to give us an idea of what the U.S. is and should be doing in the world.  The first sections of the book deals with the idea of neoconservatives.  Fukuyama argues that the neocons in the Bush administration have moved far beyond what the ideology originally stood for.  Since this group's interpretation and behavior has overtaken the original intent, the word "neoconservative" is largely useless...at least to Fukuyama.  There have been many discussions of this topic as well as accounts of neoconservatism, but I found Fukuyama's to be the most thoughtful and well-written that I have come across.  The following sections of the book deal with issues such as preventive war, development (economic and political), international institutions, and American exceptionalism.  In each of these areas, Fukuyama discusses where the U.S. has made mistakes, and offers recommendations as to how the U.S. can alter its behavior in order to bring about a more peaceful and developed world that will benefit everyone.  He talks specifically about the Iraq war as well.  Personally, I don't think he should be faulted simply because his thinking about the war has evolved since the war was launched.  He's upfront about the fact he supported the original idea...is it an intellectual crime to alter your thinking as events change?  I would like to think it isn't.  Fukuyama has evaluated what happened since the war was launched and produced a very valuable critique of how the U.S. handled it.  I believe his approach to this issue is much more helpful than those that supported the war, but refuse to admit mistakes in its execution.  This book is a wonderful resource for students and scholars of U.S. foreign policy alike.  I feel that Fukuyama has presented a vision of what U.S. policy should be that deserves to be read and considered by all, regardless of your political ideologies.  I don't agree with everything in this book, but I feel as if I have a better grasp of the debate now that I've read it 
 "What are you lookin' at butthead? Say hello to your mom for me."   "If my calculations are correct, once this baby hits 88 miles per hour, your gonna see some serious sh*t."  "If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."  - M.I.L.F hunter, Biff Tannen likes big butts, while the sh*t hits the fan in overdrive, as Doc Brown gets "Temporal Experiment #1" underway, but, all Marty McFly wants is to concentrate real hard to get "Back To The Future"   Its been 20 years since "Back To The Future" was released in theaters on the Fourth of July weekend of 1985. The film that rocketed Michael J. Fox to stardom is still one of Director, Robert Zemeckis' best films is a modernday family classic.   Its October 25, 1985, & Marty McFly is the typical, average American teenager living in the small town of Hill Valley, California. He plays guitar, skateboards, has a girlfriend, (Jennifer Parker) & gets detention from the school discplinarian.   The one thing that annoys & embarasses Marty the most, is his family.  His dad, George, is a complete wimp & ultimate nerd, right down to the pocket protector. The senior McFly doesn't even stand up for himself when, his boss & former high school bully, Biff Tannen brings the family car home totalled & a complete wreck. What's worse is when Marty finds out that his dad is basically doing Tannen's job, typing up reports & handing them into his boss to make Tannen look good.  As for Marty's mom, Lorraine? After years of living & being married to George, that includes three kids, she's basically become a hardcore alcoholic. The family drunk. Marty's brother, Dave works the night shift at the local Burger King (the one next to Doc Brown's lab), while Marty's sister is still in high school.  The future doesn't look to bright for the McFly family. Or does it?  In the wee hours of October 26, 1985, Marty gets a phone call from his mad scientist friend, Doctor Brown, & travels by skateboard to the Twin Pines Mall. Once there, Marty experiences Doc Brown's latest invention, sitting in the parking lot - a time machine made out of a DeLeorean. Marty also finds out that the machine runs only on plutonium through the flux capacitor (that powers the time circuits) & the Doc has stolen a case from a group of terrorists.   Of course, Doc Brown tells Marty the whole story just in time for the terrorists to come screeching into the parking lot, machine guns blazing. Through the fire fight, Doc is hit & Marty has no choice but to get into the DeLeorean & try to escape.   Escape he does - 30 years into the past. Its the early hours of November 5, 1955 & Marty can't believe his eyes. The mall isn't there, his neighborhood, Lyon Estates, is in the early planning stages, & worse yet, Marty has no way of getting home (the case of plutonium was left behind in 1985 (or is it ahead?). Marty hides the car behind the Lyon Estates billboard & heads into town & his worst case of culture shock. The cruddy, almost deserted town square of 1985, is the spotless, busy town square of 1955.   Things go from bad to disasterous when Marty has a run in with his father and changes the course of future events that lead up to George meeting & falling in love with Lorraine. Marty, after some convincing, gets some serious help from a younger Doc Brown. The Doc explains to Marty that if George & Lorraine don't fall in love, they won't get married, if they don't get married, they won't have kids, & if they don't have kids..., Marty will not only erase himself from existence, but, will also erase his older brother & sister as well.   As for the problem of getting Marty back to the future & saving Doc Brown's life, thats going to be like catching lightning in a bottle. Then again, if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.  After the success of "Romancing The Stone" in the spring of 1984, Robert Zemeckis shopped his next project around. Basically, the story of a teenager who has to learn about the concept of time. After every major studio passed, "Universal" picked it up only under the condition that Steven Spielberg be executive producer for the project.   Zemeckis' first & only choice was Michael J. Fox for the role of Marty. But, when Fox wasn't available (he had commitments with the show "Family Ties") Zemeckis settled with Eric Stoltz. But, after Fox did some stern renagotiating at the 11th hour with "Ties" creator, Michael C. Gross, Fox jumped on board "Future" while Stoltz got a pink slip (this is a sore spot for Stoltz, even to this day).  Fox's schedule was so hectic, filming between "Back To The Future" & "Family Ties", that he only got roughly eight to twelve hours of sleep each week. Fox was so tired it got to a point where, while getting ready to go on stage to film a live scene of "Family Ties", Fox was looking for the JVC camcorder prop that was used during the previous nights' shoot for "Back To The Future"!   While the film was recieving great critical acclaim & box office, Michael J. didn't know exactly how big the film was. When "Future" first opened in the U.S., he was in Europe filming a "Family Ties" T.V. movie of the week. When Fox did come home he found people camped out on his front lawn waiting for him & his autograph!  Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc Brown & should have gotten an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. He's the best mad scientist since Dr. Frankenstein himself.  The comic timing & chemistry between Fox & Lloyd is classic.   20 years after its release, "Back To The Future" still looks bright enough to wear shades 
 According to me, the book has been done very nicely. Tthe chapters have been managed carefully and efficiently. Read it once and u will surely know the HOWs , WHATs,WHYs and etcs of Distributed Systems 
 Thanks for the fine actors for supporting this quirky, violent film.  Many of them play against type and Vince D. creates an original sadistic dealer.  Hopefully no one will try to emulate his sick torturing ways in real life.  Basically the story is a mystery and the layers unfold as the story moves along.  In many ways it is a conventional mystery but with highly original characters.  Kilmer does some of his best work and you have to wonder if his bad boy antics have affected his ability to get roles since he delivers such a great performance.  Too bad this is such a litlle known film.  It deserves better 
 My Classical History student point of view is as follows: This is a book for all that want to explore the ancient heresies. Some familiarity with the history of the subject should be required, but this book is not hard to grasp as far as reading comprehension of its ideas. If one has had bonehead English class then it is easy reading. The book contains great introductions. Its price and understanding of how these books came to us (modern man) is priceless! Kudos and deep thanks go to the members of the Coptic Gnostic Library project of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity. I enjoyed it very much, and continue to enjoy it! 
 the moving water fasinates her and she spends more time drinking.... it's great. And the extra capacity jar works great when we are away 
 From the first time I picked up the first book in the series, I can not wait for the next one to come out. This is truly a wonderfully written series and I enjoy every minute I am reading them 
 This is a great CD for the dance scene. Some of the songs remind me of JT's days with N'Sync - they have the N'Sync "sound", however, songs like Sexyback are unique and you can't help but want to dance to it. An essential for the dance collector's library 
 My India-born spouse once described the difference in how he and I had been taught, through subtle societal reward, to make and respond to assertions. "If you say, 'The sky is blue,'" he said, "I think, 'Ann thinks the sky is blue.' But if I say to you, 'The sky is blue,' you say, 'Oh, it is?' You're ready to believe, just because I stated it as fact. That's why you hedge your thoughts with the words, 'I think,' rather than just saying what you think."  I recall that conversation as I read Arundhati Roy's The Cost of Living, in particular, the essay "The Greater Common Good." Because her voice is clear and compelling, my first response is, "Fifty million people have been displaced by ineffective dam-building in India! Good god, what can be done?"  Then I slow down. Remember. "Arundhati Roy thinks that fifty million people have been displaced in India, by dams she thinks are ineffective. Does she make her case?"  She does.  "The Greater Common Good" means to persuade, but its reportage is separable, sentence by sentence, from the argument. Roy's research is compiled, not from debunkable interviews, but from government plans and records, World Bank reviews and estimates of economic benefit and capital cost, and from statistics such as river flow, reservoir levels, areas of irrigated land, numbers of malaria cases, and megawatts of power produced. More than careful, Roy gleefully points out that the Indian government has produced no studies to verify the difference from the lowest baseline calculation of displaced people, or to quantify agricultural benefits gained from completed dam projects.  To follow along, you'll need to work through numbers and a cast of characters, as with any story about accounting and the preservation of power. The payoff to your attentiveness is that once you gather who's done what and at what cost in India's dam-building plans, you are as fully armed as Roy herself to examine the rest of her assertions. You'll have enough facts to agree or disagree with her thesis, "Carelessness cannot account for fifty million disappeared people... Let's not delude ourselves. There is method here, precise, relentless, and 100 percent manmade."  Roy doesn't leave the American reader the familiar out: "I don't live there. I don't have the right to an opinion." Roy works in facts as well as narrative; you'll be hard pressed to evade responsibility for your assent or dissent from her conclusions. Like this one: "Resettling 200,000 people in order to take (or pretend to take) water to 40 million--there's something very wrong with the scale of operations here. This is Fascist math." You can agree or disagree... but reading "The Greater Common Good," you can't wheedle your way out of having a stance.  Two treasures are secreted away inside "The Greater Common Good." One is the story of modern Satyagraha--the practice of nonviolent resistance--how the villagers of the Narmada valley walked into the valley when it was to be flooded, willing to drown. They won a postponement and an independent review of the dam project. The other is a thin, brilliant thread through the narrative: Roy's support of her right as a citizen to research and respond to her government's decisions. It implies the reader has an obligation to respond as well.  In a single sentence, in the heart of the essay, Roy says, "The people whose lives were going to be devastated were neither informed nor consulted nor heard." Her challenge to the reader echoes, unstated: So what do you think of that? What do you think? 
 MOUNTAIN MAN continues to be a classic in American Western literature.  The major foundation for the movie, Jeremiah Johnson, MOUNTAIN MAN tells the story of Samuel John Minard, a mountain man known for his physical prowess and for his quick and educated intellect. A renaissance man who has chosen the life of the great American West.    In his adventures Sam meets up with Indians of various tribes, other mountain men and a crazy pilgrim woman.  HIs marriage to an Indian maiden leads him into a one-man war with sweeping consequences for himself and for his enemies.  MOUNTAIN MAN, as is the case with most books upon which movies are based, considerably outshines JEREMIAH JOHNSON in its story and characterizations.  But, hey, I love the movie as well.  I guess that says a lot about what I think of the book.  THE HORSEMA 
 Dorothy Allison is a amazing writer, she speaks the truth about her life.  She is telling all of us a story about what really has happened to her, we should all be very luck that this dosent happen to every women out there. She is not a "man hater" as someones review has said.  I also read this book in college and loved it, i went out and bought 2 more of her books.  Whoever did state that it was a horriable book... needs to go back to their college english class..try and just try to put yourself in her shoes.  Maybe then you'll get it 
 My name is Amanda Marsan. I am thirteen years of age. I am also homeschooled and my step mom teaches me. I read these wonderful books for part of My schooling and I find it very hard to put them down. I very much appreciate the Elsie books. They have inspired me to be a truely rightous person. When I first stared reading the books I thought that Elsie must have had some super powers, but as I went on Elsie enceraged me to read Gods word and now I know I can have the same powers as God gave her Even though these marvelous before I read these books I absolutely hated reading and I was slow at it but now I enjoy reading and I find myself getting faster and faster. I have never been in a situation similar to Elsie's but I can know that whatever situations I am in God will be with me and strengthen me 
 Reading "Hey Rube" is a bit of a disorienting experience.  Doc narrates his gambling-man take on parts of four different football seasons, and it all starts to run together long before the paperback concludes on page 243.  Honestly, by the end, I couldn't keep track of who had won which Super Bowl, and whether or not HST beat the point spread.  Are the Raiders still in the league?  Reading a collection of ESPN.com colums covering November 2000 through October 2003 in something far quicker than real time is perhaps not the way Hunter S. Thompson is meant to be read.  The columns that stuck in my memory, oddly enough, were not the Gonzo columns (except for the stories about Prince "Omar" running through the 2001 World Series).  The single column take on Dale Earnhardt's death at the Daytona was the first reprint in the book to grab me by the lapels of my T-shirt.  The discussion of the Honolulu Marathon raises a point so amazing I can't believe I hadn't read it elsewhere before -- in what other sport do professionals and amateurs compete on the same course and the same time?  I wish the editing of "Hey Rube" had been a bit tighter.  The back cover blurb promises "critics' favorites, and never-before-published columns"... without identifying inside the book which is which.  The first "Hey Rube", from November 2000, is printed out of sequence and highlighted on a gray background.... and that's the only column in the collection to be given special treatment.  Finally, the paperback ends in mid-October 2003, not compiling the balance of HST's columns through February 2005.  We thus miss his take on the 2004 Presidential election.  Did Kerry win?  Did Doc cover the 3-point popular vote spread?  ESPN.com still has these final columns archived.  Read more than a year after the release of the hardcover, the paperback edition of "Hey Rube" is a book without an ending 
 Even though it took me a while to get this book, the moment I did, I couldn't put it down. I really felt as though I was sitting down having a one on one conversation with Desi Arnaz. Its so real, tells of his early childhood and the hardships he overcame, his experiences in coming to America, and of course his life with Lucille Ball. A must have and a wonderful, wonderful book. Well done Desi 
 This book is essential for faculty who believe in libratory education.  When I got my first job as an instructor I read a few books on college teaching and they were fine for nuts and bolts like how to plan a syllabus.  However, hooks writes about heart-matters that really affect teaching and learning like engagement, multiculturalism, theory, feminism, community, class, and eroticism.  For example, she discusses teaching which engages the learner (why is this taken for granted preK-12 but abandoned at grade 13?) and being a diverse teacher with diverse classes in a predominantly white male academy (if you're female, or not white, or not straight, or 'political', this is you), and other topics essential to understanding the undercurrents which happen every day in lectures across the country.  I must say that I am struck by the strongly negative reactions of some reviewers.  For me this book was an oasis in the desert 
 This is one of my favorite Nora Roberts book. I have read it several times. Luke is a great hero (even if he is a thief) and I just fell in love with him 
    Oasis truly have a gift for producing good music. Many people dont like Oasis becuase the claim to better than the beatles..... well they are. I base music on the way it sounds and the way it makes me feel not what the lyrics are. Ill admit the beatles had much better lyrics than Oasis but Oasis just plain old sounds better than the beatles. I know many people are going to disagree and take offense to me saying that Oasis are better than the Beatles but its my opinion. Oasis just sounds great and this CD proves it. Rock n Roll at its finest. I didnt think so at first but Oasis has made me believe that they are the best bnad in the world. This is an amazing album and is filled with great songs. I especially love wonderwall in my opinion it is the best song ever written. Morning Glory is also amazing and so is champagne supernova. This song is packed with great tunes. Like I said earlier i base music on sound and the way it makes me feel. This album has an unbeatable sound and makes me feel great. Every time i hear Oasis i jump up and sing along because their sound gets in your head and reverberates through your body. It makes you feel good and at peace with the world  I tried listening to the beatles but they are painful to listen too. their music sounds forced and painful but Oasis has a swagger that the Beatles cant touch. I know this will upset die hard beatles fans but its my opinion. Many people dont realize how good Oasis are because they hate them for claiming to be better than the beatles and have a stereotype against them and refuse to listen to them. Give them a chance and listen and you will fall in love with them like I have.  Now back to the album; its Amazing. Probably the best album ever (maybe Oasis previous album Definitely maybe holds that honor)The three best songs on the album are: Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, and Morning Glory. Followed by Some might Say and the soft and beautiful Dont look backi in anger. There are other classics such as Hey now, shes electric and cast no shadow.  Buy this album its sounds amazing and it makes you feel great. Sorry if I offended any Beatles fans but give this album a chance.... you wont regret it  Long live Oasi 
 This will be the FIRST gift I give to my friends getting married for the second time!  Naylor brings every possible scenario to the forefront and discusses them with sensitivity and insight. Soup to nuts for the second-time bride and groom, this book takes ALL the guesswork out of the wedding plans.  A MUST-HAVE 
 We are fortunate to have Tim Mills-Groninger consulting with us at the Tai Sophia Institute; his chapter on staffing is excellent and the issues of enthusiasm, expertise, trainability, maximizing systems, etc. are good reminders between visits 
 OK (I imagine there's still drool over my "earlier" review...and my wife is none too pleased either...) TRUTH OR DARE time! I bought this CD out of none-too-scientifical curiousity, that, and "Let Me Blow Ya Mind" - and guess what?  I'm beginnin' to dig the entire CD.  As I mentioned, 99 & 44/100th% of "rap music" fully explains to me what Gregg Allman meant when he sang, "It's not my cross to bear." OK, that being said, Eve pulls no punches (although the "skits" on the thing about wet myself laughing), and she's not a lady whom'd I'd like to cross.  But "I bought the ticket, so I'm gonna take th' ride."  And enjoy myself mightily while doing so.. 
 Ms Davidson thank you for keeping me up till late hours of the night. I have enjoyed each and everyone of your Undead books. I can't wait to read the new one 
 Just when I got depressed about the direction of the social capital debate, this bookcame out. Orr, gets it right. Social capital explains a lot about how local politics unfold, but there are also other things going on, and social capital can applied in an intagroup or intergroup context. The social capital book to read this year. Forget Putnam, Read Orr 
 I have been a fan of Kraftwerk since I was in high school in the early 80's.  I  was still listening to them in college in the late 80's.  People used to think I was weird, but I would crank my "Computer World" in the dorms anyway.  I was so excited to see that many of my favorite songs were now available on DVD.  I just purchased this DVD and I really love it. The sound quality is great, the video quality is outstanding, and the songs are awesome!  If you are looking for a lot of action by the guys on stage, you will be disappointed.  This is not like a Devo concert!  You basically see them standing in front of keyboards, while there are different videos playing in the background.  It is well worth the money for the Kraftwerk fan 
 As funny as it is beautiful.  And its really really...both 
 I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I didn't love it. The idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one I found appealing, but the plot was, at times, predictable. The setting was well-drawn, but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional. The clincher, though, is that I'm not sure yet just how captivating Anna Pigeon is as a main character. I believe that this is her first story, so I don't want to make a snap judgement, but Anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple. That would be expecting a lot, I know, but frankly she isn't even as engaging as, say, Gideon Oliver or Sharon McCone or Brother Cadfael, and she lacks the depth and power of a Harry Bosch.  As I said, the jury is still out for me here. I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I wasn't wild about it. It's a solid first try, and I'll certainly read another Anna Pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series. I expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable. I recommend it, but my recommendation is a mild one 
 when the movie came out in the philippines in 1973, the "movie-in-the-making" special was replayed many times on afternoon tv. it showed the fifth dimension performing "living together," as well as burt bacharach conducting the orchestra, performing the title theme.  wish that "special" is available on dvd, it is as memorable---probably even more---than the movie.  the fifth dimension also performed songs not in the movie, such as the spiritual "nobody knows the trouble i've seen."  many outside the u.s. enjoyed the movie, as can be seen in the many customer's reviews.  at that time, at a young age, i couldn't understand why it was a flop in the u.s., when it created a lot of buzz in this part of the world. 
 The Late Grover Washington made a masterpiece with this classic track. The other tunes are good runner ups 
 I loved this book!  Then again I loved "Wonderful Town," and "Manhattan." I was born in New York, and remember sneaking away to take the subway from the Bronx at age 8 in 1950 to catch glimpses of the glittery awsomeness of Manhattan.  Leaving New York in 1954, I returned as an adult much later and made friends who had been part of the dizzying scene of the fifties ...intellectuals, bohemians.  Reading this book so vividly recreates an era that, as the cliche says, will be no more.  Perched between the Gotham of the 1930's, the art deco towers, the Met, the Frick, and the Space Age of the 1960's there was a post-war mecca for the arts and letters.  New York was the center of it all.  I have no idea how this book will be perceived by those who have not experienced this period, at least in some way.  Perhaps that is the story of some of the reviewers who didn't like it.  But for me, the book is like candy. 
 Paula's magazine is wonderful...unlike what one of the reviewers wrote about the recipes being bland. They are all from Paula's cookbooks, new recipes or from her friends.  NONE are bland...they are Pure Paula and all have the wonderful southern flare she is known for.  I have been fortunate enough to meet Paula in person and was at a recent taping of her new t.v. show Paula's Party...this magazine is just another wonderful extention of her many talents! 
 Wow being a gay male must be rough, so I can't go there. I found Edmund's so called "ramblings" as described by many reviewers to be beautifully written and real. Yes, the book was a bit hard to read and get through, but I found it poignant yet distressing. Most of his friends start dying, and his surrogate teenage children go back to Chicago. I found the chapter about Gabe and Ana rather interesting since it was retold again in The Boy With The Thorn In His Side (Gabe and Ana are Keith and Laura), in his version he describes all the love he feels for them as a mentor/parent. Not only is Edmund in the 70's, a gay cruiser, struggling writer, drug user, but he also has to struggle financially to parent two rambunctious teenagers that he rescues from horrid circumstances. Edmund writes from the heart, and is painfully honest as he writes about the many losses he goes through in this wonderful book.  
 Gang-raped five years previously, cute and plucky Chihiro had managed to overcome the trauma of that event and put her life back together.  She got a good job, even got a boyfriend.  But then her past reared its ugly head.  The three gangbangers decided to celebrate one's release from prison by calling on Chihiro.  The first one showed up alone-which turned out to be a big mistake.  He pushed his way through her apartment door, raped her, and proceeded to once again ruin her life.  He showed up at her job and started a big fight.  He chased off her boyfriend.  This storyline reminded me of "I Spit On Your Grave", with much less gore though.  Sorry, this was not your typical Japanese bloodfest.  No, this one was all about revenge, and the personal price the girl had to pay.  There was little to no suspense here, same with the gore.  Not very much was revealed about the characters.  And as for the sets, much of the story took place inside Chihiro's apartment.  Ironic vengeance was what drove this story.  The woman took back her life, at the cost of her heart and soul.  I liked the ending.  We don't know if she jumped from the terrace, or if she escaped to Europe.  And that's ok.  Either way the story of her being abused by those sex maniacs-including her boyfriend-ended on that terrace.  Freezing the rapist's dead bodies was a wonderful means of poetic justice.  All in all I thought this was a good film.  It's in a genre by itself.  It's not horror, nor mystery, and certainly not action.  It is what it is, an enjoyable and intriguing look at one woman's fall into insanity, and the desperate measures the cruelty of humanity can drive us to.   
 It has everything you need to know about screen printing.  also an extensive list of merchants to purchase through.  
 In the mid-1990s, a team of American science students took on the might of the Las Vegas casinos, and came home with millions of dollars. Hardworking engineering students during the week, they became high-rolling gamblers by the weekend and proved that, in one game at least, the house doesn't always win. The game was blackjack, and the students were from the world-renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Their audacious winnings marked the climax of an arms race between casino and player that began 40 years earlier with maths professor Edward Thorp. He realized that the one feature of blackjack that made it different from other casino games also made it possible to beat. The unique way blackjack was played, the odds were not always the same in every round. After each hand is played, the used cards are put to one side, and not shuffled back into the deck. They are effectively removed from the pool of available cards in the next round. So in any given hand, the odds of getting an ace will decrease if an ace has been played in previous rounds. Aces are beneficial to the player, so having a smaller proportion of aces in the deck shifts the odds further in favour of the house. Previous gamblers had realized this fact, but no one had the insight to come up with a practical system to take advantage of this phenomenon.   Thorp announced his strategy at the American Mathematical Society in 1960 and news quickly spread. He was approached by the mysterious 'Mr X', a gambler and businessman with strong links to the underworld, who was eager to see whether his strategy could make real money. Mr X put up 10,000 dollars to test the system. Unaware of Mr X's mobster links, Thorp agreed, and playing according to his strategy in Reno casinos, managed to more than double his bankroll in two days of play! In the early 1990s, however, a new breed of counters emerged. They had a greater level of resources, training and attention to detail than the casinos had ever encountered. Semyon Dukach, Katie Lilienkamp and Andy Bloch were all studying at MIT when they heard of card counting as a way to make extra money. MIT had a history of card counting. Indeed, Ed Thorp himself had developed the original system whilst at MIT, using one of the most powerful computers in the world at that time. MIT counters played in teams, usually of three or more. Each individual was given a specific role. Some would simply watch tables, and wait for favorable situations to appear (the 'spotters'). They would call in the expert strategist (the 'controller') who would fine-tune exactly when was the optimum moment to play, and how much to bet according to the cards being played. The controller would secretly signal to a 'big player' who would then join a table and place a massive bet at exactly the right moment.   The trio played blackjack all over the world on and off throughout most of the 1990s, making money wherever they played. Their exploits only came to an end when Griffin Investigations, a private agency hired by casinos, identified the members of the MIT teams after months of surveillance. From that point on a team player even entering a casino would be swiftly ejected. Card counting still occurs wherever blackjack is played, though as casino technology advances it becomes harder and harder to make anything but a small profit. Facial recognition technology, computerised blackjack tables and rule changes are slowly eating away at the small advantage possible through counting. But the lure of easy money makes it unlikely the casinos have seen the last of the counters. For 40 years they have found ways to make profit, and their ingenuity is bound to succeed again 
 The case studies presented in this book describe examples of information security problems faced by real organizations. They are analyzed in depth and each one covers a different area. There are seven case studies in all and they are:  *) Kraft Foods Inc.: Protecting Employee Data *) Advo Inc.: Integrating IT and Physical Security *) Yale New Haven Center For Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Response: Contingency Planning *) IBM: The Embedded Security Subsystem *) SRA International, Inc.: Automating Compliance with Federal Information Security Requirements *) FBI New Haven Field Office - A Computer Analysis and Response Team: Tracking a Computer Intruder *) Aetna: Developing and Implementing a Successful Information Security Awareness Program  As can be seen from this list, each of the cases covers a significant area of the information security field.   I teach two courses in networking, where most of the work is hands-on. Therefore, it is not suitable for either of my courses. However, I will recommend that it be used as a text for the course "Information Technology Management" when it is offered again next academic year. The level of coverage is detailed, but not so highly technical that it is beyond the level of most IT managers. For this reason, I can also recommend it to managers of IT facilities, independent of the type of information they are processing and protecting. 
 This is a real tour-de-force in terms of the extensive material it covers with wonderful text and pictures. I had the opportunity to personally interview the author, Harold Evans, for our website. Despite its incredible  volume and depth, it is accessible to the reader because it is written  almost as if it were a series of magazine articles taking you through 100  years of US history. For many of our readers on the homeschoolzone, each of  the bite-size pieces would make a wonderful jumping off point for a  discussion or a research report for their children. I would strongly  recommend this book not only for your children, but for yourself. As the  author put it, "This is History for Browsers," and I most  certainly agree with that and am continuing to pick the book up and browse 
 Great F****** album. I'm tired of people over-reviewing albums that need less talk and more listening. This album is brilliant, both in originality (except for their name) and in musical ability.  Do you try to analyze a cool breeze on a hot day or wish a mountain range could look more majestic? If you do, go ahead and kill yourself because life will continually disappoint you.   This album is great. Enough said 
 I consider "Maroon" to be my favorite Barenaked Ladies album for two reasons.  First, I think it represents the most interesting collection of songs they've ever put together on a CD, ranging from subjects as diverse as infidelity ("Off the Hook") to meeting one's demise in an auto accident ("Tonight is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel"), to Hollywood marketing hype ("Sell, Sell, Sell"), to the angst of growing up ("Baby Seat").  Second, I consider it a signifcant album because multi-instumentalist Kevin Hearn, who was diagnosed with Leukemia shortly after the recording of the band's previous album, "Stunt", was around to contribute (and thankfully still is; his Leukemia has been in remission for about 6 years as of this writing).  For this reason I find the bonus track "Hidden Sun", sung by Kevin, to be especially moving.  One gets the impression that he is revealing to the listener some insight that he discovered during his fight to stay alive.    There are only two tracks on this CD that I'm not overly crazy about: "Conventioneers", which tells the tale of two attendees at a business convention engaging in a brief dalliance; and "Helicopters", a rather dark song discussing the protagonist's reaction to war.  As the Amazon.com review stated, one can easily discern the influence of early XTC in some of the band's tracks, and as one customer reviewer noted a bit of Beatles as well ("Go Home" reminds me of the Beatles' "Act Naturally" from a stylistic point of view).  The lyrics to almost every one of the tracks in "Maroon" reveal an unusual depth of articulation and expression.  Steve Page and Ed Robertson never fail to amaze me in that regard.  And it should of course be noted that this CD was produced by legendary producer Don Was.  Simply put, there is a lot to like about "Maroon", and the fact that it gets a prominent spot in the CD changer in my car ought to tell you what I think about it.  This one is definitely worth a listen.     
 Man, but this one is a gut-wrencher! Total angst-fest! On the one hand, we have Alex trying to lose himself in this case in order to escape from his own misery now that Robin has left him (again) and on the other hand, we have Milo wallowing in his own fear and self-loathing when those close to him are threatened.  Dr. Alex Delaware receives a notebook labeled "The Murder Book" in the mail. No return address. It is filled with grisly crime scene photos. When he shows it to his friend LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis, the big man is stunned by one of the photos. A blast from the past. The death of Janie Ingalls had been the first really nasty murder Milo had encountered as a young rookie detective 20 years ago. She was also his first unsolved case. He'd done a good job of putting her out of his mind since then, but now, it all comes rushing back and Milo is not happy.  To add to the detective's despair, it becomes obvious someone is manipulating him and when his lover Rick is threatened, the gloves come off! It takes all his wits to keep ahead of this situation. Those capable of doing what was done to Janie are capable of anything - the danger is real and may be coming from all sides - he can't even trust his own department! He tries to get Alex to back off, but the good doctor needs the distraction to keep his mind off Robin, so he keeps right on doing his tenacious bulldog thing, almost getting himself killed in the process. (Nothing new there, though).  We learn a whole LOT about Alex's and Milo's past in this one and we get some insight as to why these men are the way they are. Great character development, great stuff. If you're interested in the characters in this series as well as the mysteries, then this one is a MUST READ 
 I'm a complete "Veronica Mars" loyalist, having religiously watched the show since season 1. It was a no-brainer for me to buy the soundtrack but I was surprised by how much I would enjoy it. Usually TV show soundtracks have half the songs that you actually like, and the other half are songs you can't even remember being on the show and seem like filler. This CD is unique in that it is one of the only CDs I own where I like EVERY single track. It's amazing.  Track 1: We Used to Be Friends Probably my least favorite on the album only because I've heard it so many times. It's still catchy and a great song, though.  Track 2: I Hear the Bells Fantastic song by Mike Doughty. The lyrics are interesting and the melody is addictive. It reminds you of when it appeared in the show and makes you think of Logan and Veronica back in the day.  Track 3: I Know I Know I Know One of the main reasons for me wanting this soundtrack. I remember hearing it in the episode when it originally aired. It's insanely catchy and a great song to listen to in any mood.  Track 4: I Turn My Camera On Perfect song to emulate Veronica's job as an amateur sleuth. It has an atmospheric, funk pop feel that is extremely enjoyable.  Track 5: No Sleep Tonight Song with a great beat. A great song to listen to if you want to get in a good mood.  Track 6: Dakota My favorite track of the album. A mellow and amazing song that evokes times past. It sort of reminds you of the past.   Track 7: Sway Great love song. I wasn't too keen on it at first, but it grew on me.  Track 8: Long Time Coming Another highlight of the album. Has a funny feel to it but is very enjoyable.  Track 9: On Your Porch Perfectly captures the turmoil and themes of the TV show. A somber and inspiring track.  Track 10: Ocean City Girl Didn't like this song at first, but the mood it puts you in is very relaxing. Great song to just chill to.  Track 11: Momentary Thing Screams of Veronica and Logan. Great song to bring up memories.  Track 12: The Way You Are One of the most unique songs on the album. It's dark tones are absolutely addicting and thrilling to listen to.  Track 13: Lost & Found A nice, sweet song that perfectly captures some teen angst.  Track 14: Lily Dreams On I couldn't think of a better end to end the soundtrack. Words cannot express how beautiful this song is. It also ended the first season with a dreamy feel. The song can actually bring tears to one's eyes if you think about how devastating it was for Veronica to lose her best friend.   Overall, an unbelievably fantastic soundtrack. It matches the brilliant nature of the TV show. MUST BUY 
 Irish director Neil Jordan has made a mature movie for adults about an affair between the wife of a British diplomat and an athiestic novelist. No less a character than God Himself performs two miracles to resolve the plot. It's based on an acclaimed semi-autobiographical novel by Graham Greene told in two parts: the diary of the novelist, baffled by her ending of their affair, and the diary of the wife, explaining why she did it. Both accounts are told side by side, moving back and forth between wartime London and the postwar 1950s as the end of the affair and reason for it are revealed.  This is no ordinary adultery. It's the blitz and bombs are falling nearby when the novelist's apartment is hit during their lovemaking and she sees that he is dead. A lapsed Catholic, she promises to leave him forever if God lets him live --- just as he walks in the door. To her lover and husband, it appears she is seeing someone else and together they hire a detective to identify him. After she kisses away a boy's birthmark, they are stunned to learn their rival is God. The novelist transfers his hatred of an unknown lover to an unknown God. Jordan's few changes in the narrative actually enhance the film, one of the best screen adaptations of the oft-adapted Greene.  Jordan's casting is usually so adroit that Julianne Moore, the Chicago-born New York actress, at first seems an odd choice for the wife in this all-British cast, there being no dearth of fine English actresses. Moore gets by on sheer skill and luminosity. Ralph Fiennes, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart are pitch-perfect as the novelist, husband and detective. All four play this somber chamber piece like a string quartet. You may recall an earlier 1950s version, following publication of the book. It starred Deborah Kerr and Van Johnson (yes!), who was turned into an American reporter. Better not dwell too long on it.   
 This book offers a lot of insight into the future of successful business. It contains invaluable suggestions and advice for both existing companies as well as new businesses. This is one of the few books that are written with a focus on the future, providing the reader with numerous innovative ideas and strategies. This guide will undoubtfully be useful to businessmen and students alike. Highly recommended 
 The author gives an in depth incisive analysis that shows in great detail how culture truly affects a societies prosperity. The western countries largely had firm beliefs in progress, private property, freedom, a work ethic, tenacity, thrift, and competition. These traits led to Europe's unprecedented innovations and technological advancements. Japan and Hong Kong are prime examples of non-European countries that have had fantastic success by adopting western style Capitalism. In my opinion their strong sense of family was just as crucial. His conclusion that until these traits are adopted by all nations, the CHASM between the rich and poor nations will continue to grow. His thesis proved logical enough for this skeptical reader to agree with him. 
 i read the art of war years ago and the it was a good book once you got around the fluff. this book is short, and to the point with a new twist for every day life 
 Despite what you may think when staring at this novels 600+ pages, `Seven Types of Ambiguity' is an easy read.  Telling a very intricate story through the eyes of seven different people, the reader is never bored and is never lost for everything and everyone is in perfect symmetry even if their opinions on matters differ drastically.  Elliot Perlman's writing style is magnetic, for while it's quite detailed and sophisticated it's never over the readers head.  As far as his writing is concerned, it is one of the novels biggest draws as well as one of its only deterrents.  The problem lies within Perlman's decision to keep every narrator sounding the same as the one who came before him.  Angelique, the kind-hearted prostitute, uses the same language as Simon, the advanced literature teacher, and that just doesn't make much sense.  That said, the story itself really stresses the fact that almost every action and or motive attached is in it of itself very ambiguous.  You have the same series of events, the same situations, told and retold by seven different people and the ambiguous fragments of these humans lives become clear as day.  The story for the most part revolves around four people, Simon, Anna, Angelique and Joe.  Simon is a former teacher who at one time fell in love with Anna.  They've long since separated and Anna has been married to Joe for a few years.  They have a six-year-old son Sam together.  Angelique is a young prostitute who falls in love with Simon, and Simon, while not `in love' with her loves her in his own special way.  The novel opens with Simon's therapist Alex speaking with Anna, pleading with her to do all she can to save Simon.  You see, Simon, in an attempt to unite himself once again with Anna, kidnapped her son only to be turned in and arrested.  He claims Anna gave him permission when clearly she didn't but feels that Anna will save him and they can again be lovers.  Caught in the middle of this fiasco though are Angelique and Joe.  Joe and Anna's marriage was already on rocky soil (Joe frequently visited Angelique) and now it's even more unstable.    Through the eyes of these five, as well as a business partner of Joes and a final narrator of whom I won't broach (the final part of this novel is so important to the brilliance of this story that I fear mentioning it in any way shape or form could potentially ruin the whole experience) we see not only the effect that this event has had on the parties involved but also who these people got in the predicament that lays before them.  Each of these characters is vastly different yet similar in so many ways.  They all suffer from the same insecurities and they all fail to read each other properly.  They take each other for granted, they trust each other too much and they tend to assume the worst in one another when it's obvious they are drawing the wrong conclusion.  Each person is willing to create a lie and stick to it in an effort to convince themselves of what they really want to believe.  The most interesting of these characters though lie in the suffering spouses so-to-speak.  Joe, while not literally suffering since he in it of himself is not the exemplary mate, is torn to pieces by the prospect of his wife having an affair, and when he finds out that the other woman in his life, the woman he confides in and trusts implicitly (Angelique) is also associated in an intimate way with Simon he begins to unravel.  His narration is probably the most enthralling and absorbing.  Angelique though is probably the most sympathetic and relatable of the seven narrators.  She's kind-hearted, compassionate and real and while she battles with her love for Simon and her frustration in his determination to have the one woman he doesn't belong with we, the reader, and drawn to her and in essence fall in love with her ourselves.  By the novels end you'll be flabbergasted that Simon ever wanted to sacrifice his relationship with Angelique for that other woman.  `Seven Types of Ambiguity' is fantastically written and engrossing from start to finish.  Its 600+ pages fly by.  I personally cringed at the thought of starting this novel, for the task at hand seemed almost too daunting, but much to my pure delight it really was an easy read.  I really have nothing but admiration for this masterpiece, and if it weren't for the one minor flaw I mentioned earlier I would say this was a perfect novel, but that flaw in itself is no where near enough for me to complain.  Don't hesitate to open this book, whether it be for the sheer size or the college vocabulary, for this novel stands alone as one of the most satisfying reads I've had the privilege to experience 
 When I first saw the book I started laughing.  I didn't realize the book was going to be so small.  When it says a "little book" it means a little book.  Once I started reading the book I was amazed.  All the little no-no's, I was doing.  I even did a class presentation based on dining etiquette, and I used pointers from the book for a hands-on demostration.  Our grouped received an A+ on our presentation.  Many of my class mates have also ordered this book as well.  I really wanted to know more about dining etiquette and this book did the trick 
 a good book and very easy to follow, Eating at the restaurant is an experience not to be missed by indians and englishmen alike.  The book has some veryinnovativ and alsio authentic recipes and is a must for all lovers  of good indian food 
 I you were the type back in the day that bought all the 12 inch singles (which there were plenty of back in tha day), but not the albums, then you'll love this as a starter joint.  To my amazement, they added "You Can't See What I Can't See" which  was released as a single but never put on an lp.    All songs take me back in the day when life was simpler and less complicated and all you had to worry about was having your 3.99 at "The Wiz" for the next album or .99 for the next 12 inch single.  Like all greatest hits cd's, there are always gonna be some curious omissions and additions which prevented me from giving it 5 stars.  First the omissions, I'm curious as to why Blue Funk was left off this list, as well as "Nike" "Money Earnin Mount Vernon" "Who's The Man (From the movie soundtrack with the same name)" the reggae smash "Mood For Love (which wasn't a single but received heavy radio rotation on r&b radio)" and of course the remix version of "Got Me Waiting" with r&B sensation at the time Silk.  The real crime is leaving off "Don't Curse" which was phat and "Peaceful Journey" off the same named lp.    The additions, "Just Coolin".  Nice song for it's time but it was Levert's song with Heavy D rappin a few lines in the song.  That could have easily been left off.  But other than that, great cd from a great artist and lyricist 
 Two profs write 211 pages describing the details including the antics of this fabulous Key West club at the 801 Cabaret. The narratives are descriptive of the relationships between the drag queens, the personal histories of each of them, and vivid descriptions of their performances. You'll be entertained, however, I personally wish they went into more complex detail as to their repeated reiterrations at the end of each chapter that drag queens are questioning gender, femininity, masculinity, etc.  We already know this. How about breaking down what all this means instead of quickly glossing over it in the last chapter? 
 One fun thing about being a reader is discovering a new author that you like. I got this book, ignored it for a while, then picked it up and wound up staying awake quite late as I couldn't quite put it down. Today I went to the library and got the two books they had by Brian Haig.   Brian Haig has created a character who is in the active army, an attorney, an investigator, but with a background of doing more active things. This book starts as a murder mystery but then it turns into a very complex international situation with a lot of the action taking place in Iraq.   The interplay between our friends, allies, enemies -- and the Shiite/Sunni fight is both educational and explains things better than reading a straight description.   Finally I really like stories written with a bit of humor. For instance, on the opening page the hero meets a fellow investigator at a murder (or maybe suicide) scene with the opening line, 'Come here often.'   Enough writing, I'm going order the books I don't have 
 If you like this almanac, you'll love American Almanacs, A Living History, in which the Old Farmers Almanac is discussed in major detail from a conceptual, historical, and practical angle.  American Almanacs, A living History is a great video or dvd for anyone who loves their farmers Almanacs 
 Ok, this is trip hop at its best (and not pop like some reviewers called it).   Featuring fresh new voices, including the sweet Liz Frazer who was actually pregnant when she sang 'Teardrop', most of the songs in this album consist the perfect soundtrack material for most genres of films.  The drums and bass are so perfectly orchestrated that you only want to close your eyes and sink into the music. Best tracks: Teardrop, Inertia Creeps and Angel.   If you are a fan you must have it. If you're not but you're trying to research their music, it's good enough, along with the two previously released albums 
 Good melodies and groove. You will not be disappointed. Forgive me for not writing lenghty but this ranks among the bests of the Incognito albums I have (and I have most of them!)ï¿½ 
 Amazing account of the whaleship 'Essex' .  Also an interesting history of the whaling industry itself.   Hard to put this one down, though, so make sure you've got your life caught up before you start reading 
 Excellent overview of different aspects of the Christian life and following close after God.  Looks at different techniques of a hard pursuit of God 
 This book contains a lot of information on the studies and polls the authors took of the greatest managers in the world. A lot of it is very tedious reading, however there is a HUGE pay off.My key learning from this book was: ALL great managers live outside the "BOX" of coporate America. They are not trapped by the "rules", they see the rules as only guidelines to achieve whatever the real purpose is of their business. They focus on the end result and not on doing things for the sake of doing them.I have found this book to be true in real life in watching promotions over the past 15 years in my own company. It could have been written better in a better format, but if you love information you will love this book. It's style is a lot like the book "The millionaire next door" 
 I work in law not medicine.  I bought Taber's because of the many personal injury cases with which I was involved.  People talk about legal language - nothing compares to medical terminology.   I have found Taber's to be extremely helpful in translating the medical reports that pass across my desk.  It is comprehensive and yet breaks down the terms, diseases and injuries into language that a non-medically trained mind (mine people!) can understand and explain so that a judge can understand.  And because life can never be too good, it is very easy to use.  The diagrams and photos are excellent - at least to my non-medically trained mind.  The indexing is top-notch.    I also gifted it to another legally trained friend of mine with the same glowing reviews.  I fully recommend this title 
 This book will help you more than most pastoral aids.  I've used it since 1997 and have coached others to use it since 1999. This book will transform your perspectives.  There are many nuggets in each section of the book worth going over several times.    For example, he has a little section on biotic principles towards the end of the book. This shows the key to releasing growth principles in a church. Further research since the book was published has essentially strengthened the argument laid out.  With overwhelming research data to support his argument, no one can afford to ignore this landmark volume in our day.  I would also recommend NCD Implementation Guide which is filled with practical tips as well 
 The Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart is an incredible collection of poems  dealing with men's issues.  It is great to use for men's work, such as  introducing discussion on various subjects, or setting the tone for  sharing.  There is some stuff in here that will make even the most heavily  armored man weep.  Bly's SNOWBANKS NORTH OF THE HOUSE is a classic 
 The shoes are great, very comfortable and ordering throught Amazon was quick and easy. They were delivered within a few days and I didn't order express shipping.  I will buy through Amazon again. I highly reccomend shopping with Amazon 
 This is a very straightforward book for parents. It is particularly great for first timers. My wife and I have learned many mysterious things about parenting and find the guidance in this book to be very helpful in stressful times. I will buy this for all my expecting friends 
 Describes Cornell's philosophy of outdoor education and gives instructions for playing outdoor education games that work. This is an excellent guide for  educators, camp counselors and scout leaders. Some  games are designed to work in forested areas and are  difficult to adapt to treeless areas 
 A great story for those who are interested in how records are made. Emerick makes you feel like you're in the little recording room with the Beatles as he explains how they created certain sounds. As he describes those songs you've heard a thousand times, you'll gain new insight on the sounds you've taken for granted (for example the innovative steps required to create the bass sound on Paperback Writer). There is some coverage of the personalities and the infighting, but only to the extent necessary to decribe how it affected the recording/writing process. My only disappointment in the book was the surpisingly brief description of the process of recording the Free As a Bird & Real Love tracks for the Beatles Anthology. Given the unique situation of recording Lennon songs without Lennon, there's little discussion of the engineering and production - only a description of the vibe and the mood as they worked on it. That bit aside, a great story about groundbreaking achievements in recording as well as songwriting. 
 This is a good study of the problem thirty years later.  There's nothing to be done now, as it has been perpetuated by those in the upper echelons.  No influence is greater than that of America's schools. Children spend  thirty hours a week in school during thirteen of their most formative years.   After 1960, when life was moral and family oriented, schools took on the parental role and punished children who would not bend to their strict discipline. The rules and regulations of an unjust corrupt system, I hated the power the schools exhorted and forced on the students and, as a consequence, their parents.   The bigger and meaner boys (bullies) were able to hold sway, and public school no longer was for the more intelligent. Integration tried to bring the brighter Caucasians down to the level of the lowest blacks. So much for equality.   This was not education, but indoctrination to produce a 'chocolate' race, according to the New Orleans Mayor (he said that and got elected again anyway, so what's all the crap!)   It was an abomination against God who created the different races. The blacks predominated and brought a gutter mentality to the fore.   Private schools flourished as the more sensitive students could not cope with this depravity. But they were only in the larger towns.  A college biology teacher had to move to Nashville to find a safe place for her precocious son, away from the violence and nastiness of the minority children which was inbred. This coward has a different opinion but needs to read these varied essays --used the cowardly way like a certain Texan did in March.   America has changed, even more so since 1999 with the influx of the illegals from Mexico. In this town, people from all over the world ride the public buses, speaking their own languages; some are students at the University. What is most disturbing is their refusing to learn to speak English. Here they are in the South, but who knows what they are saying.  The dumbing down of our students before college leaves them unable to compete with those foreigners who received better education with the exception of languages. Lamar Alexander, former Governor of Tennessee, was advocating year-round school for twelve hours a day, in 1989. Education will never catch up to what it was before LBJ's Great Society reform. This is the demise of education.  This book is an eye-opener with its truth (confirmed by factual information) about the decline of education and life in America since the 60s, and the consequences we will be forced to suffer through as a result of immoral leaders with no belief in God.  The harassing person who hates this review can write one of his or her own.  Debate is alive and always has been since the beginning of any type of government in this country.  Lawyers still debate.  So can reviewers, but you don't step on the other person's freedom of speech.  
 The images in this magazine are always first rate and the editors get access to houses no one else does.  The writing is also very good and the houses chosen for each month are always in varing designs and spectucular.  This magazine does have a certain reputation of being on all the coffee tables of the wealthy, but is not Town and Country, it really is a magazine that takes its name seriously and the writers are well informed and have skill.  Pick it up sometime, it's worth the effort.  
 If you liked playing the game you will love this book.  The story line are the Chief vs the convenent will help you satisfy your fix while you wait for Halo 3 
 "The Prose of the Trans-Siberian" poem remains my favorite piece of Cendrars writing but this novel is a close second. I passed my copy around and everyone that had a go at it praised the thrills it delivers. Cendrars is a character who seems to have known everyone and been everywhere during those wild experimental years at the beginning of the last century. He documented his many careers(he had a go at just about every art form) in four volumes of biography. Three of which I think are available. He also lost a hand in WW1 and wrote a very beautiful poem about it, such is the magnanimity of this soul who was such a restless originator of new forms it seems he could have single handedly brought about modernism all on his own. Of course his many friends (of which Picasso was one) did what they could too. As a poet his reputation is solid, as a novelist he is still gaining ground as his books begin to reappear after a long abscence. Moravagine is a book full of anarchic energy and though one of the main characters is a bit primitive that was after all one of the aspects of modernism. The wild beast of a main character is Cendrars monster or more specifically modern societies monster. There is also a monkey who is curiously human. The writing is manic at times but there are few lulls on this cross continental journey where the primitive and the civilized seem to walk hand in hand . If this was made into a picture it would be a road picture replete with half man half beast lead, civilized man narrator, and well clad monkey companion. Cendrars family album 
 Due to popular demand, this book is now back in print and available again. Enjoy 
 Harding exceeds the remarkable clarity of even his own previous work with this gem of clarity and insight into our fundamental nature.  A "must read" for anyone who want to really "get" what Zen,  Buddhism, Christianity, etc. have really been about - and to get it in a  moment, instead of at the end of a lifetime's effort 
 I am a big fan of N. Sparks and enjoyed this book as I do all of his books 
 There are certain myths that seem to center a culture, stories that define and create a nation's heritage.  The Great Gatsby defines the central american mythos.  The Brothers Karamazov centers the Russian canon; and without a doubt the Fausus legend is at the heart of Germany's entire history, both political and cultural.  Thomas Mann's retelling of the Faust legend for the twentieth century rarely misses a beat in its probing inquiry into the nature of Aesthetics, Sexuality, and Politics.  And while the central questions on the role of power in relation to morality and the limits of artistic freedom that are the center of the Faust legend are here, Mann also manages to bring originality and his literary gifts to this retelling.  What is remarkable about this narrative is that it tells you as much about the narrator as our Fausus himself.  The narrator, Dr. Serenus Zeitblom, is just as central to this tale.  His relation to our Faustian composer provides much of the dramatic tension as well as a human element in the esoteric wars over the nature of artistic power.  Mann is among the greatest novelists of our century, and this is an unflinching novel that strives for meaning while within the echo of the Nazi guns that are the testament to the power of Faust and the darkness that the human soul must resist 
 So, i love this version of Twelfth Night - it's the best one out there! The product arrived after a couple of weeks, which was kind of a pain because i needed it for school, but it worked out. The DVD was in good condition and has good picture, no problems, and will last longer than the VHS 
 excellent crossover reggae-hiphop music. but I want my Jamaicans doing yard music not american far 
 While Sourcery succeeds at being a genuinely funny story with some interesting plot developments, I feel it is weaker tham most of Pratchett's efforts. Part of this is due to it's use of Rincewind as a main character. The world's most incompetent wizard is also the one Pratchett character who goes through little if any character development. Whatever book about Rincewind you pick up, you can count on him to be completely self-centered and cowardly. The best you can say is that his running skills steadily improve.   Pratchett's thesis here is that there is something out there far more powerful than wizardry. Something that tapped right into the world's magical forces and could change reality. This something is called sourcery and you have to be an eighth son of an eighth som to even qualify. Which is why Ankh-Morpork's wizards are forbidden to marry. The last time there were sourcerers they set about trying to kill each other and very nearly turned discworld into a radioactive Frisbee. Wizards try to kill each other too, but on a much more incompetent scale.   Unfortunately, Ipslore the Red cheated, got married, and was promptly thrown out of the Unseen University. Not a fan of birth control he promptly had eight sons (his daughters were uncounted). Coin was the last, and Ipslore, angry about the death of his wife decided to make the young boy into his means of revenge. When the wizards met to elect a new Chancellor, they found a surprise candidate - a 10 year old boy with a knack for turning people into greasy smudges.   Coin turns magic upside down, gives the wizards almost inexhaustible power, and starts coming very close to starting Wizard Wars II. The unlikely team to come to the rescue is Rincewind, Conina (the barbarian daughter of Cohen - capable of wiping out entire police forces while being a hair stylist), and Nijel - who learned everything there is to know about successful barbarianism from a comic book. And don't forget the Chancellor's what, which is so appalled by the mess that it sets out on its own.   As you can see, there's quite a bit of potential for a good story here, and much of it is realized. But Pratchett sets in to repeating his jokes just a bit too early, and some funny things become less funny too soon. This book is hardly a failure, it just suffers from too much type casting (if you can call barbarian women who just want to settle down and style hair 'types'). I prefer Rincewind tales like The Last Continent, which has less Rincewind and a stronger plot. Still, you will want to read Sourcery, and you'll probably like it despite this review. 
 Freedman has managed to write a history and a survey of global feminism that is at once accessible, activist and academic.  The compact size and the colorful comic-inspired cover design of the trade paperback edition bely its serious scope. It is truly comprehensive, opening with a powerful argument for feminism (lingering on the term's ever-troubled, never-popular nature), proceeding through the history of various feminisms, marching on through topics as diverse as the impact of globalization on female laborers in the developing world to contrasting feminist opinions on the agency of sex workers. While the focus is primarily on the U.S., the global perspective does comes through.  She manages to tone down the usual prominence of European and Euro-American influences while elevating the profile and contributions of feminists throughout the world. For the global sections, examples are drawn as readily from China and West Africa as from the United States. Freedman raises the bar for creating a feminist narrative that is continually mindful of the influences of class, race and culture as well as gender concerns.  I recommend this book for committed feminists, those lamenting the so-called `death of feminism,' and for closet feminists who are bothered by the f-word. 
 In writing this book Dr. Andreasen had to consider her audience. This book was written for a general audience, not the academic or medical community. Therefore it must appeal to that end both in language and length of text. I think that Dr. Andreasen is successful in her anecdotal approach to writing this book. It keeps things interesting for those of us who might have trouble sifting through the thousands and thousands of articles published about creativity in medical or psychology journals.  If you are looking for a summary of everything that has been written on the topic, you are looking for another book....and very likely one that would not be of much interest to a general audience. Why anyone would expect a book that is obviously written for most moderately educated people to be so conclusive, especially at this stage in neuroscience, is beyond me. If one were to try to cover all aspects of how people are creative, it would likely be longer than all of wikipedia. I am an artist.  For this book, I used a method usually reserved for viewing art, and that is, assume everything is intentional. If the painter gives Mary a long neck, it's not that he or she doesn't know how to paint a neck. It is because the painter is trying to emphasize something about the neck. Being a PhD in English, I would gather that Dr. Andreasen knows a thing or two about writing well.  Being an accomplished scientist in addition, she also has an amazing capacity to make difficult topics easy to understand.  Perhaps this skill-one that is quite rare in highly credentialed scholars like Dr. Andreasen-is one reason that several reviewers have perceived the book to be "too simple." In this book Dr. Andreasen has selectively chosen some aspects of creativity the aspects of creativity that she finds most interesting.  The most challenging aspect is the neuroscience of creativity.  How does the brain actually work when it develops original ideas?  The book is a tour de force in this respect.  Few others could have written about this topic in such a knowledgeable but interesting and approachable way.  
 This is simply the best film of all time. If you want something that is as close to my life as you're going to get, this is it. I'm not jewish, but I can relate to the lifestyle growing up in  West Omaha. It was a jewish kind of suburb without the little hats. I can flat sing, DO NOT ARGUE WITH ME ON THAT ONE!!!! I write my own songs about all kinds of things. I write about birds, bowling, canned peaches, why all the countries around russia have different names now and why a ref cost Nebraska the national title in 94 against FSU. I can do that where maybe you can not. I have the ability to make changes on the fly. My story is very similiar to Neil Diamond's character. I grew up in Nebraska, spent some time in Dallas and settled in east G-town. I never recorded an album and have only been to California once. So you can see where I relate to this film. I do like to sing though, as you can tell by my wonderous tales of bands I've fronted. Let me tell you about another one. I've always been a Neil Diamond fan, so I fronted a speed metal Neil Diamond cover band called Moldy Applecore. We took Neil's music and sped it up. When you have Jabs playin leadbass like his kids are being held hostage by Mayor McCheese, Kroll drumming like he's being chased by a drunk fat girl and me belting out Diamond standards like I wrote them, the world is your audience. We sold out the Gretna bowl in 3 minutes last summer. We played a 52 minute version of "America" that included several america themed songs stuck in to change tempo. We threw "Grand old Flag" and "Born in the USA" in the second 20 minutes of the song. The crowd went nuts and felt more patriotic than when Kerrie Strug ran into the pommel cow when he hip broke in 95.   This movie is the blueprint for moldy applecore. That alone makes it the best film of all time. I'm awesome, in case you were wondering 
 This CD is an excellent remastering of an earlier recording, but I thought the sound was a little lifeless at some points.  Prokofiev's intentional discord in some parts was a little jarring to my ear, but that's a feature of the music, not the performance.  I think you would be surprised to recognize parts of this music even if you think you've never listened to Prokofiev.  Bits of these soundtracks have been recycled for other films than these.  This is a worthwhile addition to your collection 
 In order for any organization to fuel its growth, it must excel at product development.  How to do this?  An organization must first approach development with new proposals from every corner of the organization. Evaluate these ideas rationally and systematically and then select the best ideas.  The organization's goal is to create a portfolio of the best selected ideas to help the organization grow.  An organization must then manage these projects in four stages: building case justification, concept feasibility, product development, and pilot and production startup. 	 Taking a new product from the basic idea to the product requires many steps that are connected in specific ways.  An organization must rely on marketing intelligence, product definition, planning, research and development, process development, product launch, and after sales service.  To be successful an organization must learn:  	Brainstorm new product ideas 	Coordinate the production and manufacturing processes 	Ensure an effective IT system is in place 	Lead the development instead of just managing 	Create loyal customers and keep them satisfied 	Create a quality product or service 	Measure and manage operations 	Manage the organization's intellectual property 	Manage the organization's liability 	Create effective Research and Development Systems 	Harness technology now and in the futur 
 If you are expecting a straight adaptation of the novel 'Naked lunch' you've come to the wrong place.. If you are looking for two styles converging into a twisted bizarre sci-fi arthouse extravaganza - step right up.. David Cronenberg (the fly, scanners, eXistenZ, etc.) has a unique attatchment to surreal sci-fi investigations of the nature of reality and transformation (I think I am miserably failing to describe his cinema) - Burroughs also has a style which, shall we say, twists the bounds of reality -sometimes literally in his drug induced descriptions in 'Naked Lunch'.. but mostly in his radical prose style (something between james joyce and aldous huxley but with an extra ingredient of the bizzare).. somehow this meeting of two artists works out and creates this frightening alternate noir-like alter-universe called interzone.. Highlights of the movie include Cronenberg's strange puppetry which bring to life Burroughs creatures of his own unconcious mind.. This is a beautiful movie to look at - and one that plays like a fever-dream.. My only dissapointment was that I had just read the book - and was still so in awe of Burroughs writing - that I had trouble excepting an interpretation.. But Cronenberg's artistry actually enhances more than it detracts. 
 This was a wonderful yet tough one for me.  I listened to the audio version and wonder if because I heard so much emotion in Mr. Grogan's voice, I felt it even more than if I had read it.  At any rate, most parts were adorable and hysterically funny.  I am a dog lover so I understand the frustrations and yet, hearing them come from someone else was tough on me, particularly when Mrs. Grogan loses it.  That said, the fact that the Grogans loved Marley to pieces rings loud and clear here so no judgements intended if that's how I sound. Most times it sounds like their patience was endless and I believe that this is in part why dogs are here on this earth. To teach us all the simple things we should do but forget to.    Marley was a loveable goofball and sweet and innocent.  That is exactly why I love to read about dogs.  Sadly, their time here on earth is way too short.  I was driving to work while listening to Mr. Grogan telling Marley how much he loved him and I have to tell you, I nearly had to pull over.  I'm tearing up just thinking about it now.    I came away from this book loving Marley perhaps almost as much as his family...and that is a real tribute to Mr. Grogan's ability to share Marley's story with us.  Thanks to them for sharing Marley's life 
 I notice that, as of the time I write this short review, John's biography of Gene Clark gets 5 stars from 6 of 7 reviewers and 1 star from 1 reviewer. Don't let the 1-star review mislead you. He is not really disappointed by the book. He is disappointed by the reality of Gene Clark's life. And that is what this book does an excellent job of conveying. John Einarson goes into the minute details of Gene Clark's life. It wasn't pretty, but the story is compelling. John does not glamourize the rock star life. He doesn't editorialize nor hyperbolize. He simply tells the story. I am truly impressed by the research that John did for this book, and he does an excellent job of laying out the story. The book is readable. It never seems like a star "tell-all". It is simply the story of Gene Clark. I recommend it highly. I have read several of John Einarson's books about folk rock and country rock artists, and I think this is his best 
 Thomas Moore broke the mold when he wrote this one!...Moore took me everywhere inside myself, and drove me to the core of my soul.  Everything that i had origionally thought about life, was turned inside out, upside down.  But it was as if all these ideas were already seeds in me, yet they had been covered in a lot of petty, crappy, useless things.  My soul was watered and i am now a child again. Unlearning all that i have been taught and reviewing all that was origionally in me!  THis book was hard to understand at times, but after you read it over and over....it hits you like a brick!  I recommend this book to anyone, and everyone 
 This is the book recommended by graham greene in his autobiography.he had studied this book inside out before embarking on his illustrious career. I suppose no other stamp off approval is needed after that.... 
 After owning this product for 1 month I can say I'm very happy with the purchase I made. The webbrowser works really well, if your into weather like I am there are sites that do not use java for moving radar. Its great for watching video too, the viewing angle is excellent. Battery life is also great becasue you can watch a movie, and even another hour long TV show and still have hours of music listining time.The case that it comes with isn't the greatest but it keeps the player safe. I higly reccommend this product 
 My daughter and I both adore this book. She reads it over and over and brings it to me to read several times a day. It just makes you feel good. : 
 Fathers and Sons has been hailed as a masterpiece of Russian literature, but I knew nothing about it before picking it up.  I was certainly impressed.  The book centers around Yevgeny Bazarov, a young radical who embraces the idea of nihilism.  Bazarov rejects the old conventions of the past (religion, aristocracism, liberalism, essentially all "-isms") and believes that life is meaningless.  During his travels with his friend, Arkady Kirsanov, he discusses and argues his beliefs with both parents and other characters.  Despite his insistence that nothing in life has any meaning, Bazarov is a caring, loving man.  What happens in the plot is of little importance compared to the progression of Bazarov and his beliefs over the course of the novel.  The novel's ending comes suddenly, but is not surprising.    What is more crucial to the novel's success is the way it captures the essence of people's relationships and feelings through Turganev's recounting of events.  One always can tell where people stand in their opinions of each other simply by their basic actions.    I was fascinated that in Bazarav, I could see feelings about tzars and social class in general which was reminiscent of the impending Soviet Communist Revolution.  I also saw overtones of modern existentialism in a 19th century novel.    Like many Russian novels, Fathers and Sons can be somewhat wordy and complex.  I am not sure if the English translations are to blame or if the style of Russian writing is simply not what Americans are used to.  Nonetheless, Fathers and Sons is a classic and should not be missed. 
 My family loves this game - even though rated for ages 10 and up, my eight year old has no problem playing (we skip subjects like "DNA").  There really is no artistic skill needed - even plays better when a few of us aren't very good.  We've played with as little as four people and modified it to as many as ten - every time has been so much fun and sometimes makes you laugh until you cry! 
 This book will really make you think and evaluate how you perform and react in the workplace.  The book has many different sections that should assist you in how you may want to behave in your workplace.  Chapters include: dealing with a difficult boss, 25 career blunders, 25 moves you must make, how to get your boss to advance your career, building your power, major players in your company and how to get them to go to bat for you, and so much more.   What I like about this book is that it does not ask you to employ and dirty or devious tricks with your co-workers, but rather, it asks you to take the high road, and to treat people well.  When things do go wrong, it has many suggestions for bringing to light situations in a delicate way that will aide in helping the situation without a huge loss of face to the instigator.    I would highly recomment this book, as it may help you get to get along with your co-workers, how to deal with a difficult boss, and how to move ahead in the company.  Excellent suggestions are made on networking, learning your own motivations, and tips and changes you can make in your career.  This book is well worth the read 
 This is a magnificent book. It provides an insightful collection of  essays whose overriding theme may be summarized by the following  statement: "Political liberty is a spiritual value." An autobiographical  introduction positions the author as a former 60s "liberal" who  gradually woke up to smell the coffee. This is followed by an essay that  distinguishes between the political philosophies of individualism and  collectivism, personal liberty versus "group rights." An essay on Waco  makes it clear that the deaths of 100 Americans can not be brushed over  as some "little aberration" of the Clinton era. An essay on September  11th draws on the author's expertise with Islamic secret societies. The  essay on the Second Amendment is written by a partisan of the Bill of  Rights who understands the meaning of the phrase "shall not be  infringed." I personally found his (humorously titled) Goddesses, Guns  and Guts to be the most controversial in the book. Here, a well-known  occultist discusses the need for belief in a higher power to make  oneself a worthy candidate for true political freedom. Suggested Actions  offers an elementary program to begin to break out of the modern media  trance of daily life. Liber Oz by Aleister Crowley makes clear the  author's true Libertarian stance in words of one syllable.  These essays comprise the first half of the book. They are followed by  meticulous documentation to buttress the boldness of the author's  statements. I had only the vaguest familiarity with the utter  contemptuousness and banality of the key founding documents and  agreements of the United Nations. Although this material may be said to  have been "hidden in plain sight" for decades, I wonder how many of you  or your friends have ever read it. I think Wasserman proves his point  that the UN is the prototype of a one world socialist tyranny designed  to creep into every living room and bedroom on planet Earth. And he does  so by providing accurate and complete versions of the material these  busybody bureaucratic wannabes have written themselves.  One may easily dismiss the author's assertions of the treasonous trend  lines of America's ruling elite (whether disguised as "democrats" or  "republicans") as the opinion of a patriot who may have an untimely  fervor for individual liberty. Like some 18th century throwback who  didn't realize the Age of the Expert had put an end to the concept of  personal sovereignty, the author's passion flows through a series of  carefully reasoned arguments. However, if you combine his opinions with  the documentary evidence provided by the Freedom From War position paper  of the U.S. State Department, (personally delivered by President Kennedy  to the UN in 1962) reproduced in full as Appendix Three, you begin to  realize that just because you're paranoid doesn't mean everyone's not  out to get you!  If I had any argument with this book, it was his presenting the full  text of the Constitution in the first Appendix. This would seem to be so  widely known that I initially wondered why it was included. On  reflection however, I remembered that my son had graduated from one of  the three advanced public high schools in NYC and had never read the  Constitution! Perhaps I understand the author's reluctance to leave that  crucial material out. It also adds immeasurably to the ability of the  reader to understand the primary question asked by this book, namely:  "Who, in his right mind, would be supportive of a political system that  intended to replace his unalienable rights with alienable privileges?"  The inclusion of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and  the Bill of Rights provides black and white evidence of the concept of  "unalienable" rights as envisioned by America's founders. The inclusion  of the UN material provides clear evidence of what is meant by the  phrase "alienable privileges." And the publication of Freedom From War  makes it clear that many in this U.S. government are seeking to  undermine our unique Constitutional freedoms by substituting the  international community's vision of the origin of political rights as  deriving from the State. The author dares to calls this "treason."  The annotated reading list suggests some great books for further  research. Personally, I cannot recommend this book highly enough 
 Excellent product.  Really protects you.  My dermatologist recommended this product and although it's more expensive - it's worth the protection for your skin.  I'm glad my children are using it 
 a classic baseball book without a doubt, lyle tells it like he sees it, and i loved every page of it. with a team with personalities like billy martin, lyle himself, mickey rivers, reggie jackson, graig nettles, and the boss, george steinbrenner. if you liked this book like i did read balls by graig nettles 
 I came to this book as my second Stephenson novel after Snow Crash, and I read that one the first time when I was in junior high.  Cryptonomicon was a daunting looking book, but the character development and interesting mix of stories kept me involved to the end.  Like other Stephenson books, this one contains a lot of technological excerpts, mostly about math and code breaking, and these can be a pain to get through, but it also contains some of the most realistically human writing of any author.  My only concern was the end.  I was hoping that after all of that investment, there would be a more realistic ending.  After a thousand pages worth of buildup, the ending seemed to be tacked on and all too short.  Despite this, if you are a techno nerd who also enjoys an engaging view of WWII history, this is a book for you 
 Most helpful marketing book I ever read. It had information I never knew I needed in a brief,descriptive format that I put to use while finishing the book. The reference materials were also very helpful 
 I was required to read this book for a History of the Renaissance 1300 course.  Far from a dry text, I found this book to be an enlightening view into the roles of women in Renaissance society, the social mores and opinions that restricted them, and the many ways in which some circumvented society in order to express themselves (there is a lot more there than you think!).  It is full of primary data, some of which is only available in Italian and other original languages, and translated for this book by the author.  One who reads this book will come away with a more complete and well-rounded view of Renaissance women's lives, (at their best and their worst) and a greater respect for those who lived them.  In response to the previous reviewer, and as a warning to those looking for an "easy read".  This is an excellent source of fact-based material on the time period and its inhabiants, not a pre-digested, dime-tour of the Renaissance.  But for those who are open to a little intellectual stimulation will find this a powerful, eye-opening experience worth their time 
 I think that for a first time writer/director Vanessa did a great job.  The story is based on her real family to some extent and the town she grew up in, which is VERY similar to the film and the movie was filmed there as well.  It's a movie about family like nobody could ever imagine.  This family is real, and i know them all because they are my family as well.  Others say this family is impossible to exist but THEY DO......slightly less dramatic but its all there.  I think it's great 
 With every Grisham book I read, I get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense, but to insert other elements to make this human as well.  For once, we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain.  However, this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune.  However, she does not know this.  A lawyer is sent to find her, and in the process, undergoes a fundamental change of his own.  This story takes place in Washington, Maryland, West Virginia, and the rain forests along the Brazilian-Bolivian border.  In typical Grisham fashion, he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book, enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes.  You can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions.  You can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight.  You can envision the rainforest, and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of Nate O'Riley.  This is yet another Grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue.  The pages literally turn themselves.  Do not start this novel before going to bed, or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down. 
 James Jones draws the title of this book from the "thin red line between the sane and the mad."  But the subtitle gives a clearer sense of the theme - "every man fights his own war."  On the surface, The Thin Red Line is strikingly similar to The Naked and the Dead.  Each novel tell the stories of a group of inexperienced soldiers sent as cannonfodder to fight the Japanese on a lonely Pacific island.  But under the surface, the novels could not be more different.  Norman Mailer's novel uses the war as a vehicle to preach a message about hypocricy and corruption at the core of American culture.  The soldiers, not really human to start with, are manipulated and degraded by the military machine.  The soldiers in The Thin Red Line face the same experiences as Mailer's characters.  But Jones' characters are realistically human.  They display independent thought (rational or not) and realistic emotions (alternately strained and dampened by the extremity and exhaustion of battle).  Canny or confused, each one strives to make sense of the war and of his own responses.  The theme of the book is the diversity of those responses.  The last line sums it up:  "One day one of their number would write a book about all this, but none of them would believe it, because none of them would remember it that way."    Mailer gives us subhuman characters cast as soldiers; Jones helps us appreciate the humanity that survives even in the most degrading circumstances.  Although this is a novel about characters, it does not let the reader get sentimentally attached to them.  I appreciated the measure of emotional distance because otherwise the (sometimes graphic) death, destruction, and mayhem would have been painful to read.    
 I think the story was beautifully written.  It is unique in its perspective.  So few romances are written from a man's point of view.  I was utterly engrossed in the story and i have read it many times.  It didn't get a 10 because of the ending.  It was really good, but.. well... I don't want to give it away. Let's just say it must be a guy thing.  I do encourage any fans of romance and fantasy to read it.  It is absolutely wonderful 
 Alvin Ailey was a member of Anna's (Sokolow) theatre Dance Company in 1956, Two years before he has founded is company, others memberes in the  same 1956's company where : Eve Beck, Judith Coy, Jeff Duncan, David Gold,  Jack Moore, Sandra Pine, Paul Sansardo, Beatrice Seckler and Annelies  Widman.           The person who edited this DVD thought that this fact is  not important in Alvin Ailey's Biography.       In my opinion it is  important 
 A Professor of Social Science at Princeton for decades, Geertz gave a  series of lectures at the University of Jerusalem and these were the  result.  The book serves as a memoir of his four decades in the field of  anthropology and brings together two areas of the world where he has built  his career.  Noting the similarities and differences of working in  Indonesia and Morocco, Geertz draws comparative aspects of these divergent  cultures.  Known for his 'thick description' which was made Bible in the  "interpretation of cultures" (a must first-read for understanding  his theories), Geertz uses it some, but doesn't overload the reader here.   The uninformed reader can still enjoy the behind-the-scenes-look at one of  the foremost anthropologists of the 20th century and not get lost along the  way.  For the Geertz fan, it is a must read, if nothing for his funny  anecdotes 
 I was only on the first page before the tears started.  I have not made it all the way through this book yet, but I already feel relieved to be looking in at what a day in my daughter's life is like.  There are times when I laugh because I feel that Ms. Kurcinka must have been spying on our day to day lives.  It took 8 years for someone to have the guts to tell me that no, my child wasn't ADHD, she wasn't crazy, she was probably strong-willed like hers, which led me to this book.  I much prefer the term spirited that this book uses (I have discovered I too am spirited--big surprise) and recommend it to anyone who is searching for a little peace 
 I really enjoyed this book and found it very useful.  Margaret Shepherd addresses just about any situation one can think of.  If everyone owned this book and followed these conversational guidelines, the world would be a much better place 
 It was my first book on pitching many years ago. Here is my conclusion as  compared to other books. 3 points : 1) A balanced physical preparation is  emphasized. The small weight training is explained and shown even if it is  now commonplace in every pitcher program. 2) The description of fastball,  curve and grip biomechanic... is far superior to and more complete than  anything I have seen since then. More important, experiment is emphasized  with great method. 3) Tom Seaver approaches the mechanic of pitching on a  two-fold way : first it breaks classicaly the motion, giving a lot of tips  and second it fills it with piching absolutes that give a frame for players  and coaches. This principle of a limited number of biomechanical absolutes  that rules the motion is now emphasized for instance by Tom House. However,  this book remains insufficient on practice examples in term of  quantification over a season, on tools to evaluate a pitcher and its  improvement. A lot of live examples are given on pitching strategy but a  summary table depending on the count and/or the hitter weaknesses would  have been more useful. I think the same for pitching preparation (amount of  aerobic exercices, abdominal training....?) where criterias on age and  weight, on pitching volume, would have helped establish a program. A book  to read as well as a pitcher or as a manager, not a practical tool for a  pitching coach program 
 This book is great in all aspects.  I wish the book could go into more detail, but it's delibrately a short essay.  A great overview of the astral plane.  I wonder how this compares to Steve Richards book 
 This is an armchair detective book, a cross between Cold Case & Nero Wolfe.  The Cold Case is centuries old, however, tough even for Lilly Rush.  As usual, a small key (a portrait of Richard III) opens up a big can of worms.  A bedridden detective uses his criminological skills to explore the murder of the 2 princes in the Tower of London.  The clues arrive slowly & the detective uses psychology, logical deduction, & empirical actions by the suspects to reframe the case, concluding that Shakespeare was wrong, & Richard not guilty.  Tracing Shakespeare's sources (Holinshed, Sir Thomas More, & Morton), Inspector Grant finds that historians' prior conclusions were based on hearsay evidence.  Tey thus suggests that-- p. 201: "Historians should be compelled to take a course in psychology before they are allowed to write" & p. 173: "Grant wondered with what part of their brains historians reasoned.  It was certainly by no process of reasoning known to ordinary mortals that they arrived at their conclusions."  Unfortunately reliance on the epistemologies of authority & tradition are much more widespread than just historians.  As Tey points out--pp. 131-2: "It's an odd thing but when you tell someone the true facts of a mythical tale they are indignant not with the teller but with you.  They don't want to have their ideas upset.  It rouses some vague uneasiness in them, I think, & they resent it..  So they reject it & refuse to think about it" & p. 173: "Human nature found it difficult to give up preconceived beliefs."  The belief that a mystery should be in the present, include lots of action, etc. is belied by this outstanding novel.  One does not need to be interested in history to enjoy it, only open to new approaches, ideas, & techniques.  A true detective or scientist (real scientists ARE detectives) seeks the truth via the epistemologies of rationalism (logic & theory) & empiricism (data & resulting information & knowledge) vs. relying on authority (old paradigms) & tradition.  This book has a great deal to teach us-far beyond whether Richard actually murdered the princes or not.  The approach to the problem (how to solve problems=process) is far more important than the content (specific instance).  I was fascinated by this wonderful book.  Tey has shown herself an exception even to her own astute observations--p. 196: "Most people's first books are their best anyway; it's the one they wanted most to write."  Not in this case 
 I'm mystified at the poor reviews from some of the readers of this book. This was Pulitzer Prize finalist for a reason. Eggers speaks with a great voice. He manages to make us laugh thoughout his recount of a very tragic situation and his dealings with it. Eggers has great language, a wonderful sense of humor, and a vivid imagination. I always love an author that isn't afraid to stray from the "rules." I think this was masterfully crafted. Eggers uses his head and doesn't just write it as he sees it, he thinks about what he's writing.  I loved every second of it and everyone should read this book. Period. 
 My 10 month-old son has loved this CD since we purchased it when he was around six months. My husband and I love it too.  We consider ourselves two relatively cool people and a fear was listening to unoriginal, poorly done, and annoying childrens songs.  This is definitely not the case here!  The tunes and lyrics are amazing.  The songs are sung by a variety of different characters and come from different dance genres (Disco, latin, caribbean, etc).  This CD is great to put on when you and/or your little one has had a long day -- it provides an instant boost.  A big thumbs-up! 
 The specifications described in the web are exactly the opposing ones. 
 Por el contenido le doy un 5 pero a la traduccion le doy un 2. Me parece que esta traduccion es para el lector que sabe ingles. Me gustaria ver una nueva edicion en espanol, tal vez bajo otra editorial. Aun asi lo recomiendo 
 Crichton does seem to have a thing about protagonists who are single fathers, or who might as well be. With the exception of the main character in AIRFRAME, has he ever written a competent and caring young mother? Peter Smith, the protag of RISING SUN, is a divorced father whose ex-wife literally can't be trusted to change their two-year-old's diaper and do it right. He's also a police lieutenant who has switched from being a detective to the press division - and from there, to being the department's VIP liaison specializing in Japanese VIPs. It's his job to respond whenever a Japanese diplomat or executive gets in trouble with the local law, so that the incident will do as little public relations damage as possible. So one evening as he's studying Japanese (a requirement of his relatively new position), he's called in to smooth matters between an obnoxious detective and the owners of a new office building. Right at the start of their star-studded opening party, those owners have to deal with a murder in their boardroom.  Competent writing (I'd expect nothing less from Crichton), a decent although not wonderfully inventive plot, and fairly interesting characters don't save this novel from bogging down whenever the author decides to give his readers a lesson in history, politics, and economics as those disciplines relate to U.S./Japanese relations - especially to the well-known "buying up" of U.S. real estate and businesses by Japanese investors. I got the feeling that this book was written to sound a warning, not to tell an entertaining story. Yet it does have its moments of crackling suspense, and the relationship between old Japan expert Captain Connor and the much younger Lieutenant Smith comes across both believably and amusingly. Not a total miss, but not Crichton at his best, either.  
 Orringer's writing is the most original, beautiful prose I've come across in a long time. The majority of her stories have a dark undertone, but the form is so light and beautiful, which makes them stay with you. I'd like to see one of the stories turned into a screenplay. The characters are rich, the dialogue halting. Just really fine literature 
 I had given up on this series after the last book (HMS Surprise) because I was getting lost in the seafaring terminology and there was a bit much of the love-lorn simpering in the tale.   The Mauritius Command restores my faith in this series.    It's a great tale of derring-do in the Indian Ocean, its based on some actual events and actual ships and overall the tone is very convincing.  The women folk are left back on land, and only intrude to an acceptable level of letter writing etc.  My (paperback) edition contains a valuable afterword by Brian Lavery who describes the actual ships on which the tale is based, and gives a worthwile overview of the seafaring terminology.  I still won't be able to distinguish a fore topsail yard from a quarterdeck, but at least Lavery is reassuring that they are meaningful terms.   	Jack Aubery continues on his lucky career in the British Navy, almost - but not quite - achieving lasting fame and fortune; this being more necessary now that he has a wife, three children and a mother-in-law to support.   For me, this book develops Stephen Maturin more - he is still secretive, reflective, reassuringly Irish and intellectual, however he develops a melancholia which is only temporarily suppressed by his furtive diplomatic activities.  O'Brien moves Maturin one step closer to Sherlock Holmes by hinting at his opiate use during the story 
 I have them all,...1st editions which are probably worth nothing, because his publisher knows he can write too. In my house, for mainstream writing, there are only a few authors worthy of buying EVERY book... Grisham is the only one my wife (she of more like Oprah's club fandom) and I agree on. We fight to see who gets to read Grisham's book 1st. Read them all...outside of Brett Favre and Steve McNair, this has to be Mississipi's best statesmen. Keep it up Joh 
 [...] The company is centered around on line training in the general area of graphics design. ==This book is designed to go with one of their courses. The goal of this course is to help you create a portfolio of your work. It has a series of projects where you download various components of a project, then you do the project and post your results back on-line. A Sessions instructor will then give you a short critique of your work so you will have specific person to person contact that lets you know how you are progressing. This is kind of like working as a designer and having the client look at what you've done.   As you might well guess from the sub-title, these projects are oriented to Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. This is not exactly a beginners course in these software package. You should have at least some beginning understanding of how to use these packages. The concentration hers is on improving your design skills, not on the details of the software 
 This is one of those classic books, that never get old. I grew up watching the movie, and did not read the book until I was 17. I thought, oh, this is not going to be nearly as good. Quite the opposite! This was such an enriching, lovely drama. Tragic, sure. Yet, there is hope, love, and all things enternal to human lives and love.   Read this book if you are a huge fan of the movie. Its better than the movie in so many ways. You learn more about Mary Carson, you see more of Fee's true character (and her family!!), and why Frank and Paddy are the way they are. Of course, you see in full play Meggie & Father Ralph as they grow up together, and fight the other through love, time, & religion.   So worth your time! I read it at least once a year!!! : 
 What eles is there in America these days?????  This magazine delivers on 2 of the 4.  The others are freely available on HGTV and Food Network.  But without the money, you can't hardly have 'em.  An excellent and important mag

A complete "how to" course in a single volume, Screenwriting Updated is very highly recommended for both aspiring and active screenwriters 
 I just purchased this teakettle today and my review is based on one day of use.    Design First off, it looks very nice and feels well built.  As advertised, the finish is mirror clear.  Designed for hanging, the handle feels very sturdy and looks to be well attached. The nose piece seems to be a slightly lighter weight stainless steel with a lightweight metal ball at the end.  Attached with a screw, the ball may have a tendency to come loose over time.     Use With a quart of water, the kettle boils well with a nice whistling sound.  At a boil, the handle is warm but not uncomforable to the touch.  The ball and nose piece are warm when removed but not hot and I experienced no issues with excessive steam once the unit was removed from the burner.  Pouring is easy and the handle offers a range of positions from which to hold the pot.  The only areas of the handle that are hot are the rods attaching the handle to the pot and they are unlikely to cause a burn if touched.    Recommendation This is a nice stylish kettle and will probably hold up well over time.  I can only imagine other owners have filled the pot to capacity when the handle has become hot and that may also affect the pouring.  As far as cleaning the pot I can not understand who needs to scrub the inside of the pot unless they are making soup directly in the pot 
 Dr. Lao constituted one of the most striking artistic events in the middle Sixties. The unknown origin of this foreigner, proprietor of a circus that not only will be object of enrapturing visual fantasies, but besides will make the state of things in this isolated town experiments a sudden twist of change.   Far from being a delightful entertainment there are very smart subplots to explore. Tony Randall is simply admirable with his seven characterizations.   A must-see.    
 This freshman album from The Black Angels is outstanding... I discovered this young Austin, TX band via KCRW's "Morning Becomes Eclectic"... It's reminiscent of the Doors, Dylan and other favorites with an edge of a dark hanging hue over it... The album reminds me of a complex Cabernet Sauvignon - as the it opens up, new things are discovered 
 Daniel Goleman has written an interesting book about the physiological and social consequences of emotions and our ability to control them.  He makes a convincing case for emotional competence as perhaps a greater prerequisite for success than intellectual brilliance.  Many of us can probably corroborate this for ourselves by recalling very intelligent people we have known who have a tendency to sabotage themselves through their inability to deal with other people appropriately.  For me, the sections of the book that described the physiology of emotions--the role of the amygdala and limbic system and the neural pathways that allow "emotional hijackings"--were most fascinating.  Likewise, I was captivated by the descriptions of psychological studies of emotional competency, such as the one that showed that a child's ability to control impulses at age four was a greater indicator of later success on SAT exams than any other single factor.  I remove a star because some of the later sections read like more conventional self-help books.  I was also skeptical of Goleman's proposal that schools step in and teach emotional competency through curricula such as self-science.  As a public school teacher who has had first-hand experience of school efforts to teach self-control and anger management to students with behavioral issues, I believe that public schools are not equipped to do this effectively.  The horrendous home situations of these students are, in many cases, just too pervasive and all-encompassing in a student's life to resist.  What's the alternative, since it is unrealistic to expect the families of these children to change their behavior?  Give up?  Obviously, that is also unacceptable.  However, as long as the federal government is breathing down the necks of public schools with unrealistic expectations and punishments at the ready, don't expect schools to stray far from any subject matter that is not rigourously standards-based and measureable on a standardized test 
 As Le Carre has matured as an author, his books have had less and less to do with with satisfying genre requirements and more to do with exquisite character portraits and the authors own concerns. This is not to say that his story telling abilities have suffered, but Le Carre has always been subtle, and in "Our Game" his subtlety reaches new levels.  The protagonist, Tim Cranmer comes late to the important things in his life. All the "action" has already happened in this novel - many of the important events in this novel are past memories, either remembered in flashback (or revealed through interrogation). Other main events are discovered by Cranmer as already happened as he picks his cautious way through crime scenes or recent battlefields. Even love, or his recognition of it, has come to him late.  So Cranmer's quest is his attempt to discover his real past so as to provide him with a future, or at least a present. Le Carre's writing is at the peak of its form. Sometimes drol, often witty, always poetic and wonderfully intelligent, his writing captures the humanity of its character and the inhumanity of the uncaring world in deft strokes.  This is not a novel of gunplay, hi-tech espionage, car chases and narrow escapes. Neither is this a George Smiley novel. They were written almost 30 years ago and the author has moved on. This novel sits outside the genre of the spy novel, whose vague trappings the author hijacks for his own uses. The ending, which some people may not like as it is not "neat" and "final" is wonderfully unresolved, just like life.   I read this book when it was first released and have just reread it. In 10 years time, I will probably read it again. And probably enjoy it even more. 
  Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is a fun read for all ages.  The story is about Roy, the new kid at school, who is subjected to bullying by Dana, a notoriously mean, bad to the bone lout. That bullying leads Roy on an adventure he never anticipated where he finds an unlikely ally in a no nonsense girl named Beatrice, who is one tough cookie and more than a match for the dreadful Dana! Enjoy the satisfaction when the the tables are turned and Dana finally is on the receiving end and gets what's coming to him! Humor is a staple throughout Carl Hiassen's books and Hoot is no exception. Sometimes you just have to laugh out loud! Given as a Christmas gift along with Hiaasen's 'Flush' to our oldest granddaughter, she has told us she enjoyed both books enormously. It is going to make it hard this Christmas to find books this entertaining to give her! She is an avid reader. You know you did good when a fourteen year old says, 'you always give me the best gifts' and includes these books in her list! 
 I hate so called PROG ROCK ( YES / GENESIS etc. ) and after the first run through this struck me as rather HO HUM and of similar ilk. I love TY TABOR and so had to give this a thorough listen before making a final decision on it's place in my extensive cd collection ( never to be played again seemed likely ). After a dozen or so listens, this has grown on me with every listen and keeps getting better with almost every outing. From an instant dislike, I have now become a fan and have ordered a few more KINGS X cd's. Like with most things TABOR, the hooks are irresistable and every song has an identity. These songs are superb examples of great composition's. Despite an apparent simplicity, there is a hidden depth that only becomes obvious after many listens.  GREAT MUSIK  -    BUY IT!!! 
 my teacher read this book to our class. I thought it was really funny. 
 Denise presents an excellent well disciplined theme to her workouts.  They are calm and refreshing but still move to a good pace. 
 As an economics major ('75 grad) I found this a facsinating read.  Rothschild notes that the roots of Darwin's natural selection theory came from his study of economics...and it makes intuitive sense that economics  would have much more to do with biology than math and statistics.   Capitalism is not just another economic system... it is a natural emergent  quality of nature itself.  If you want to understand the "New  Economics" you must read this book, which will be required reading in  all econ courses I'm sure 
 I had to read this for a little while before I got to a poem I really liked.  The first 10 or so poems just seemed incomplete to me.  "Independence" caught my eye first.  In very few words it pretty much tells us adults that our kids are going to do what they want, despite all the things we say.  It's followed by the wonderful poem "Nursery Chairs" where a child pretends the chairs in his house are different things.  Then after "Nursery Chairs" is another strong poem, "Market Square" where we learn that there are things all around us in nature that we don't need to get from the market.  "Disobedience" is another interesting poem.  It's kind of a role-reversal story about a kid whose mother disobeys his orders to stay away from the end of town, and she gets lost as the result of her disobedience.  "Spring Morning" emphasizes the beauty of nature to us, saying, "It's awful fun to be born at all."  Next is "The Island" which has a wonderful closing message that screams, "God made it all - FOR US!" to me.  And there are so many other joyous poems in this quick read too.  There's "Jonathan Jo," "Rice Pudding," "The Wrong House," "The Dormouse and the Doctor" (which has some terrific rhythm), a very touching "Little Bo-Peep and Little Boy Blue," "The Invaders," "If I Were King," etc., etc.  But perhaps my favorite poem in the collection is "Halfway Down" which is about nothing more than sitting on stairs.  Man, if someone can take such a simple act and make it so astoundingly wondrous, then that person truly must be one of the greatest writers ever 
 THe food items listed above are just a few of the treats and libations the survivors of the shipwreck of the Commerce had to eat in their lengthy forced trek across the Sahara DEsert in the 1800's. They also endured slavery, starvation, intense heat and thirst, and the strange customs of their captors. But like any good adventure/survival story, the suffering of the participants is only part of the picture. THIs book's vivid  portrayal of life in the Sahara and the communistic principles of the Bedouins that live there is riveting reading. By the end of the book one is sympathetic to both the sufferings of the captives and the shifting loyalties of their Muslim captors. Indeed, both the reader and the sailors become victims of the Stockholm Syndrome, whereby one becomes sympathetic to the plight of your captor, despite your own travails.  I've read hundreds of adventure stories. both modern and historical, and this is one of the best, combining adventure, history, sociology and geography in a thoroughly riveting tale of suffering and redemption. Tales where those who must endure are doing it as part of legitimate scientific, commercial or other interests are always more compelling than those adventure stories based on mere adrenalin or adventure seeking participants who stumble into disaster. HIghly recommended 
 an often funny look at the politics and poetics of a midwestern research university transparently modeled on University of Michigan.  Hynes never makes a false step combining realistic, gothic, and satiric modes.  Worth rereading 
 Works great, it should be noted that the medium ties best fit medium size (20ft XLR or 1/4) cables of the thickness quality cables typically have and that if put on thinner cables they will slide easily, and that the large tie fits the same thickness with longer length 
 If only every history book was written by G.J. Meyer!  'A World Undone' is a fantastic read; I could not have imagined a single book could paint such a thorough picture of the Great War.  I could not put this book down. I have read other volumes, including 'The First World War', 'The Guns of August', even 'World War One For Dummies'!  But this is the absolute best of the lot, providing background history on the major players and combatants, and numerous glimpses into the personal lives of the leaders and soldiers of the day.  It is these 'background essays' that make this history so much more enjoyable, so much more readable, that I was very disappointed when I came to the end.  Most history books leave you needing a break, but 'A World Undone' left me wishing for a second volume.  
 Little brother is a group that will never sell out and pollute the airwaves with commercial materialistic garbage.

 I own every diet/weight loss/fitness book known to man AND I've wasted thousands of dollars on various diets, prescription diet pills and alternative treatments for my weight.  I've battled bulimia, starved myself, gone on all liquid diets, acupuncture, weight watchers - you name it!  Nothing has worked long term.  Now I know why.  Pyatt lays it all out for you in plain english.  I felt like she had witnessed my entire life and wrote this book especially for me!  Everything is addressed in this book - Unrealistic expectations set up by the media, medical issues, how not to pass the food obsession on to your children.  She helps to take away the guilt without giving excuses.  No more diets doesn't mean more weight gain.  So don't worry.  She's not trying to make you be happy with an overweight and unhealthy body.  Even though she does say that MY medical condition (PCOS) does require a diet with certain restrictions to achieve any kind of weight loss (bummer), I wish I had this book when I was 13 years old.  It would have saved me alot of grief and I'd probably be a healthier more fit person today.  I'm planning on buying a copy of this book for all my friends and loved ones that have been and are going through the same thing.  I may even buy an extra copy to give to my doctor and a few to leave in his waiting room!  Heck, I might even take up a collection to hire a fleet of helicopters to drop a few copies over every junior high and high school in the United States!  
 If you are a beginning creative writer, or experimenting with a new style, poetry for example, this is an excellent book. The book deals with the various types of creative writing in an easy to understand, sometimes way too basic, manner. I say 'way too basic', coming from my personal situation. I've been writing fiction for years, and some of this book was, well, beneath me. I enjoyed the sections that I wasn't familiar with, as I am a little slow on the uptake sometimes 
 About I-75?  I assure you I've traveled this route many times and the last time I happened upon this book first.  How wonderful!  If you are an information junkie like DH and myself you will totally enjoy the heck out of this book.  From what the "Florence Y'all" water tower really stood for originally to..."what is that stuff growing all over the place?" in Georgia.  (thanks to the book we learned that it was Kudzu)  The Radar Alerts were very helpful and sure enough 90% of the time there was a patrol car hidden exactly where the book stated.  I also like the hotel recommendations and on the trip home we actually utilized one of those hotels and we were very impressed.    There were two things on our trip that I WOULD NOT be without if we were to drive again......XM Satellite Radio and THIS BOOK.  Two thumbs up 
 Really, what are you going to say about Kafka in an Amazon review? If you haven't read it, you should. You really have no excuse 
 Losing our animal friends is extremely hard to take. We love our animals just like people, and possibly even more. For those of us who dearly loved our departed pets, thankfully there is Gary Kurtz and Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates. A work that helps us through the toughest times of our (human) lives. A book of true hope and comfort; researched through the only possible source of such mysterious, real truth, God's own Bible.  Considering our own immortality is natural. But less so, the immortality of our pets. Whether you understand it or not, many humans in dealing with pain, are brought closer to the idea of God through that pain. And here, Gary Kurz has done a great service for believers and non-believers alike. Before losing my greatest cat friend, Mr Stinky, I hadn't really thought about animals in heaven. I had heard animals don't go there. But why not? I had no reason for my disbelief. With my intense pain from losing Stinky (I didn't name him), I needed help to cope, and sought serious answers about our loved animals in eternity.  Gary's straightforward research explains how it is very possible that The Lord indeed makes room in Heaven for our pets. But there's an unintended catch: as humans we must also believe in God as Creator of Heaven and Earth. It shouldn't be a hard concept to grasp. Yet Gary still tries to write so he doesn't offend readers who are not so quick to believe in God, because after all, there are all kinds of people in this world. And sometimes even believers have doubts. Fortunately I believe in a Heaven created by One, True God. Which makes this painful situation a little easier to take.   Thank you Gary Kurz, for writing this very precious book, for noting CS Lewis, and helping all of us realize a deeper understanding in our time of need. I hope others have a similar, helpful, eye opening experience. There is more, oh yes, there is more. Mike Talotta, Bath PA  
 A must hear for all acoustic jazz fans.  Jimmy's guitar work is absolutely stellar.  A wonderful selection of tunes and a wonderful performance 
 This was a must have album in the 1970's, but it has since been superceded by their "The Very Best of" 2 CD set.  This CD is simply a song for song re-issue of the vinyl album, so it only contains 10 songs from their early days.  Which would be fine if this were a budget release, but it is not.  The songs on here are great, but I think you would get a better value from buying "The Very Best of The Eagles" collection.  It spans their entire career and includes 33 songs on 2 CDs.  I know they want to keep selling this CD since it is the biggest selling album of all time, but they need to cut the price or at least throw in a few bonus tracks 
 Very pleased with the book.  It was a gift.  In as new condition, as described.  Fast shipping.  Best price I found anywhere. Thanks so much! 
 The Tale of Despereaux By:  Kate Dicamillo  Review by:  Colin M.  As soon as I opened the book, The Tale of Despereaux, I loved it.  One reason I loved it was because it is very descriptive.  When the author, Kate Dicamillo is describing something, she really knows how to put a picture in your mind.  For example when she describes the dungeon I can almost see the darkness and gloominess around me, and smell the dank smell.   The tale is about four main characters.  First, there is Despereaux, a mouse with large ears.  Second, there is Roscuro who is a rat who lives in the dungeon.  Third there is Princess Pea, who is a princess that lives in the castle.  And then there is Miggery Sow, a serving girl in the castle that has one, impossible wish.  How these four people change each other's lives is one thing about this book that makes it so exciting.  Another reason that I liked The Tale of Despereaux is because it is actually four books in one.  The first three books tell about the main characters, and the last book is about all of them.  The last book tells how Despereaux needs to save Princess Pea from the rat Roscuro.  Each book makes you curious to find out what happens next, and how it will all tie in together.  If you like books with all different kinds of genre, this book is for you because it is adventure, fantasy, and romance all at once.  It is adventure because Despereaux needs to save Princess Pea.  It is fantasy because there are talking mice and rats.  It is romance because Despereaux falls in love with Princess Pea.  This is just another reason why I liked The Tale of Despereaux.  I love The Tale of Despereaux because there is lots of twists, turns and surprises.  Also, the chapters leave you at cliffhangers, and you want to find out what happens next.  It is the kind of book that when you need to go to bed, you beg "just one more minute, please?" There are many good things about it, and there isn't anything that I did not like!  To find out what happens to all the characters, you need to read the book!  
 Great game made by basketball fans for basketball nuts. Like how easy is to alley-oop to self and player. It's fast and responsive. I had no problem with my copy on the slim PS2 as reported. Most be a bad PS2 that kid has. 
 This CD reminds me that music is truly art.  It is to music what a tornado is to weather.  Solid bass lines with layers of rhythym and languid melodies floating overhead, a real journey, not just a set of stand alone songs 
 An enjoyable quick read that offers a lot of down-to-earth things about Magic's life.  Growing up in Michigan, describing what school, family life, and basketball was like.  He also delves into some of his interludes with some of the ladies, and describes the constant attention given to NBA players on the road.  He writes of his HIV infection and how he initially dealt with it.  For those who've even casually been exposed to Ervin Johnson on the court or via interviews, he's one of the most relaxed and even-keel people we've ever encountered.  Magic is appreciative and laid-back.  This will allow him to live as long as people who are not infected 
 EARTH FROM ABOVE, the important photographic portfolio with accompanying essays by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, has met with such a wide receptive audience that the publishers have created this small scale 'calendar book' EARTH FROM ABOVE: 366 DAYS which gives a photograph and essay on each of the works viewed in the larger tome on separate pages for each day of the year.  The message remains the same - and here it is one for daily contemplation: we are the caretakers of the planet Earth and these stunning visual reminders will hopefully alert us all to the importance of our guardianship.  A perfect gift, especially to the young ones on your list!  Grady Harp, December 200 
 This book covers a lot of territory and does it in a very grounded manner. The interface of pyschology and spirituality is fascinating and this book brings us right to the heart of that junction where we can access much higher principles of living through a practical, real world application of research and experience. Using a significant body of research, Csikszentmihalyi delves into the question of why are we here and what is our purpose. He gets there by studying optimal experience. What is happiness? How can we sustain it given the randomness of life? He supports the rather convenient conclusion that our purpose is what we decide it will be by illustrating the necessity of ordering our consciousness through focused activiities. Actions that lead to something, somewhere. He beautifully conveys the idea that our goals in life, while deemed valuable by either ourselves or our conditioning, are not apt to be valuable if not for the committment of our actions over time. That it is really this focus that brings value to any activity and goal. Further, if we want to extend meaning to our entire life, we need to find a way to tie all of our focused activity into a theme. Thus our life efforts can provide both meaningful experience and valuable results. He offers guidance as to how to tie our decisions about our life-theme into a greater whole, for example, how traumatic experience can provide the opportunity for transcendence by helping others avoid similar trauma. The last chapter, which offers the big picture perspective of the material, was particularly uplifting and helpful as I travel a journey of 'figuring out what I want to be when I grow up' 
 For the price and the size this book wins hands down.  It is a very thorough little book, and would be a great addition to anybody's magickal library.  It is a wonderful section that is a mini encyclodedia of different plants and herbs used for aromatherapy, which lists the parts of plant used, ruling planet, and magickal uses.  I do however, like any specific topic, think you should also read and refer to other sources if you are serious about persuing something.  However, this is an excellent choice for a start 
 This is one of those real surprises.  What seems simple at first is really rather profound.  All little kids worry (as do most adults) and they worry about the strangest little things.  But we have to remember that what is little to us, is rather large to a first grader.  This little book is perfect to read to the young child and a perfect lead-in to a great discussion of why not to worry and to put everthing into prespective.  The text is quite simple and to the point.  The art work is great and goes well with the text.  The book is funny and the book is true and it has a great ending that actually teaches a lesson.  What more could you want?  I read this one to my classes all the time and have yet to find a child who could not relate.  Recommend this one highly. 
 This movie combines two things I love in a film:  The actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents. This is an improv lover's dream.  AND It makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously, in this case, dog shows. Only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog's rating in context.  Mainly though, it is just hilarious. Some (okay-a lot) of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately, and nearly too crude for me. Still, it fits the genre. 
 I was introduced to Kyuss through Queens of the Stone Age around 2001. I am just impressed as to why I had not heard about Kyuss earlier. This band is awesome. This album is amazing.  Kyuss plays the kind of rock music that I like the most. If you are looking for heavy riffs, tuned down guitars and amps turned way up, this CD is for you. There are few vocals on this record but that fits the style perfectly because the instrumentation and musicianship is amazing and the vocals kind of lurk in the back and add an extra ingredient in the right places.  This record is divided into 3 tracks, each one subdivided into more tracks. There are many styles in each track, heaviness and speed (Odyssey, 100 degrees), trippy and long jams (Space Cadet, Whitewater), great bass lines (Gardenia), and awesome drumming and guitar work overall. It also has the song Demon Cleaner which is one of the most famous Kyuss songs.  It is incredible to note that Josh Homme was in his early twenties while he composed this record, which is impressive to think that someone can create this kind of complex music at a young age.  Kyuss has been compared to Black Sabbath, but in my opinion they rock even harder.  Welcome to Sky Valley, prepare to be amazed and get ready to rock! Please follow the intructions listed in the liner notes: "listen without distraction".  Cheer 
 I discovered Iron and Wine on the Garden State CD.  Since then I have bought 3 of their CDs.  One of the best things I like about this CD is the style of their music is consistent. Iron and Wine sounds somewhat like Simon and Garfunkel with an edge to it.  I highly recommend  this CD, and Endless Summer Days, which is just as good 
 Here's my very simple take on this book: if you operate (fly) airplanes of any kind, you need to have this book in your easy-to-get-to library. Period.   My only negative comment is that the current "FAA reprint version" (How did they get involved? This is not a typical "How to" FAA kind of publications!)of the original NAVOPS manual is of very poor reproduction quality. The photos and artwork look "muddy" compared to an original copy of the manual. The text is not crisp, while some of the photographs of wind tunnel demonstrations are simply not understandable unless you know already what you're looking at.  Although it was written in 1959 by Hugh Hurt of USC under contract to the U. S. Navy (and thus its copyright came into the public domain), it remains as relavant and informative today as it was when the ink was drying on the first press run! Incidentally, this same book also had a brief life as an Air Force manual, ATCM 51-3, Aerodynamics for Pilots, used by Air Training Command as a reference text in the pilot training program during the 1960s. The USAF version simply replaced the motivational photos of Navy aircraft with USAF models, but the manual was otherwise identical. It was eventually replaced by a much less rigorous edition, about one third the size and scope, that was, by comparison, almost useless. Seems that people found it too challenging, especially all that math -- a point I'll address below.  Some of the material will shed "AH-HAH!" kind of light on day-to-day routine things; other topics will inform how you ought to approach the extraordinary, whether it's a sudden weather change, or an in-flight emergency.   Not every pilot will find all chapters equally interesting. Also, experience has shown that the majority of pilots who are interested in the details of aerodynamics seem to gravitate towards the performance aspects of aircraft flight: Performance is generally easier to understand, but the real details of how the aircraft's inherent properties as seen by the pilot are only revealed in the sections on stability and control. Don't slight those chapters.  A suggestion about approach: even though you may have never flow a jet-powered aircraft and have little prospect of doing so, don't think that it's a waste of time to learn about the details of jet aircraft aerodynamics (as distinct from propeller aircraft). Why? Because it's easier to learn first about how a jet-thrust aircraft behaves without the complications such as torque, brake horsepower, etc., introduced by getting thrust from an "air screw."  Once you're clear about these basics, then you will be able to understand a little easier how various performance and stability and control issues are affected by the propeller/recip combination.  Thus, the book is clearly oriented toward the operator/pilot and the things he has direct control over, or things that will affect his decisions or decision-making process, or choices of technique of how to operate his airplane. (You might be surprised to discover that a lot of techniques that are around were developed as easy-to-use compromises, needed simply because people didn't know the underlying details -- not because they're naturally the best way to do something.)  The only persistent objection to this text over the years has concerned its routine use of math, consisting basically of simple algebraic expressions, with some trig thrown in occasionally when trying to analyze things going on at some angle, such as  bank or climb angles.  There is also frequent use of simple graphs that show important relationships between two variables, say, angle of attack and the wing's lift coefficient.   Well, it's an accurate observation, but it's not a fair criticism -- and it's certainly not a valid reason to not use and study the text.    The book presents the derived equations, the results, obtained from other texts, whereby the pilot can see the physical terms that affect some aerodynamic terms (e.g., lift). In doing so, you also see two essential things: first, how the terms are related to one another;  secondly, how changing each of them, alone or in groups, affects the airplane's overall behavior. You see, for instance, what's really going on when you operate from a high elevation airport in the summer vs. winter, how the change in density altitude affects lift, drag, engine performance, etc. Without the results-based math that this book uses, you're really guessing or relying on what other people pass along as rules of thumb.   Can you fly an airplane without knowing how to interpret the meaning  of an equation?  Of course. People do it every day.  But: can you fully understand what you're doing  without knowing the full scope of information that the equations are conveying? No, not really. Besides, it's a real kick to be able to visualize an equation, say of maneuvering flight, and translate that mental picture into a series of control inputs that make the aircraft do exactly what you want it to do, as you bring that mental picture into reality.  For example, once you learn to think, to visualize, in terms of knowing that an airplane's turn radius is proportional to the square of its true airspeed, you know a great deal more than the person who simply knows that as the speed increases, the turn gets bigger. If you understand the relationship between the wing's lift coefficient vs. angle of attack, you'll also have a deeper understanding of the most effective techniques for flying final approach at a given airspeed and how you might safely modify your approach for unusual conditions, such as weather or being confronted with a shorter-than-expected runway.   If you don't learn the language that conveys the details of Why the airplane behaves as it does, you're always going to feel a little uncomfortable, uneasy perhaps, just as you would if you were at a party and everyone was speaking some foreign language. This is especially true when you encounter a situation that the normal procedures -- the How of it -- were not intended to address. If you don't have this underlying understanding, you'll find yourself in a position of having to play "test pilot" -- without the benefit of the training and experience that usually goes with that title!  The last point to make concerns the book's age: it is more than 40 years old now. The short answer is that airplanes still only talk Newton and Bernoulli, etc., and those guys never get too old.  The advent of the "electric airplane" hasn't changed the basic aerodynamic issues the pilot must understand. Rather, electronics largely just alters the economics of flying and has also enhanced safety considerably. Technologies such as anti-skid brakes or 3-axis autopilots have been around for over 50 years, working exactly according to the same principles then as they do today. What has changed is how much it costs to get the capability. In 1950, anti-skid braking on a military aircraft might add $50,000 to the cost of the aircraft. Today, the same system functionality is installed in cars, no less, for under $25.00! The variables (the equations) that describe stopping distance have not changed, however. For private pilots especially, e.g., the single-engine Cessna variety, the airplanes generally available to that market are much older than the book is. Even if they do have an expensive Glass Cockpit, from a performance and handling qualities standpoint a 172 is still a 60-year old airplane, no matter what the instrument panel looks like or its date of assembly.  A final comment: In my opinion, anyone who aspires to a high level of aeronautical proficiency that ultimately has safety as a major objective, anyone who wants to truly master his or her craft, needs to be able to study and learn at the level of detail and rigor presented in Hurt's technical masterpiece. It's a true classic.   
 I used this book in preparation for a trip to Italy last Spring and I found it very helpful. At first I wasn't expecting much from a work book, but they do a very good job at helping you understand the relationships between words, places, and things. I found it a good compliment to also listening to audio learning guides such as Pimsleur or Michel Thomas (you can borrow these from your local library!). I definitely used this book for more than 10 minutes at a time 
 The ideas in this book are not new, but they are powerful.  Put to practice (which is the hard part), they can truly transform a family.  I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone 
 ... on any topic.  It is beautifully conceived and organized.  I second all of the endorsements above 
 Truly enjoy each time I pop one of these CDs into my player...always turns into a sing-a-long marathon. A brilliant compilation of "Mariah's" greatest hits. 
 The Inflation myth is that it results from rapid growth.  Inflation is the result of radical new technologies and the entrance of the young new generations that bring them to the workforce.  Other than the war periods, the greatest periods of inflation have coincided with major periods of technology innovation:  Inflation wave following the crusades, another massive wave following the capitalism revolution; and the biggest wave emerging caused from the information revolution.    Inflation is a sign of progress in the making, not the destruction of the monetary system or decay of the moral fiber.  Neither political policy of various Presidents nor the monetary policy of the fed significantly influence inflation, instead inflation is the economy's means for financing an economic revolution.  The higher the inflation the greater the economic revolution to follow and during inflation money is tight, so demand for the money will be strong.   It takes a massive investment to launch an economic revolution.  The launch of the economic revolution corresponds with the growth of the labor force, whose spending patterns as group are very predictable.  The labor forces expands during the innovation wave that occurs when a new generation enters the job market.  There are three forces that influence inflation : 1. new technologies  force organizations to retool to remain competitive and requires capital investment 2.  the new generation launches many new companies, which require an infusion of capital before they become self-supporting 3.  the new generation elevates the demand for commercial infrastructures-from office space to factories to warehouses for work, and malls and store of all kinds for personal shopping and entertainment-which require a huge capital investment by businesses and government.     In Phase I, inflation occurs when investors are saving more then they are spending.  Higher interest rates fuel the propensity to spend.  The business sector's need for cash flow imposes an inflation tax on the consumer.   New businesses needing to raise capital can not finance large debts because they have not yet stabilized and demonstrated a predictable growth pattern.  High inflation forces debt financing through venture capital.  Inflation moves higher because production increases have not yet been realized adoption of new technologies that will increase productivity.  As the new technology companies begin to grow, financing begins to ease.  Inflation drops as finance and investment grow.  The companies find it easier to get credit and loans and so they borrow more to finance their growth and retool.    In Phase II, in a booming economy and falling inflation rates consumers are spending and borrowing money, so government does not feel compelled to raise tax rates.  The money government needs to produce from the growing infrastructure and finance transition into the new economy.   As the new economy emerges debt rises to finance the growth, inflation rates fall, and productivity rates remain low and improving.  In Phase III, productivity surges as the new technologies move mainstream, following the S-curve Pattern.  Business organizations leverage the new technologies to increase productivity, wages, and profits.  The high profits in the new growth companies create high cash flow for investment and growth with less need for equity or debt financing.  Based on inflation patterns, productivity, and labor force trends a massive boom for the next four years will become a reality.   The boom will not be sustained and a prolonged period of time of 10-20 years of economic slowdown will causes surges in unemployment, but eventually 3% of the new growth companies will create a surge in employment, profits, and innovations.  The real revolution will not be technology but a return to a focus on the customer, his preferences, his smart card info, and global sharing of this information between companies.   Frontline consultants will use back end server data to bring the best opinions for the consumer depending on their situation.  The organzational network will change the infrastructure, efficiency, and value companies will bring to the customer.  Companies that do not adapt will not be competitive and sales indicators will testify against them 
 After the letdown of the previous book in this series, it is nice to see Stephanie Plum back at her real occupation, ace bounty hunter.  Well, maybe ace is not the right term, but let it be.  The characters are fine and funny, as in the first ten books.  The gritty streets of New Jersey are not exactly scenic but they are very real.  And there is an actual plot, rather than a series of humorous sketches that wear thin when not attached to anything.  As for dialogue, that's why Janet Evanovich's fans keep coming back for more.  She has a real knack, an excellent ear for the nuances of street dialogue.  I can now rest easy for a while, knowing the writer has not run out of material.  My greatest hope is that she doesn't have a relapse in the 13th episode, that triskadecaphobia doesn't do in our heroine.  P.S.  This is the very best of the twelve books in the Plum series, and Stephanie holds the record for the most times a central figure is tasered in all of fiction 
 A fascinating book with wonderful photos.  The negative reviews are from people who judge Lance's private life and may not have even read this wonderful book.  If you are a Lance and/or Tour de France fan and you're visual, you'll love this book.  Lance Armstrong is a champion as was Greg LeMond.  These are athletes raising the bar and bringing us into a world we mightn't known without them.  Viva la Lance. The prose tells one story, the photos speak volumes.  
 My child loved this bed when he first saw it. He loves to sleep in it. It wasn't that easy to put together though-needs 2 people to do this. Pretty sturdy as my 2yo likes to jump and stand on his bed. 
 This book pointed out key elements of how to be successful in creating innovative company cultural.  Reading this book reminds me of a few experiences I had before and helps me understand why some companies did it so well and some failed 
 This stretching rope does not stretch on it's own but is extremely well designed and strong.  During my physical therapy I used another device that broke, so I am glad I found this to replace it..  the strap is wide enough so it does not cut into your foot and the beads on the side give you a firm grip and gives you a guide as to how well you are progressing.  An excellent tool for therapy or just stretching 
 I think I have the wrong window.  I LOVE Olivia, only not in Spanish.  I would like an English copy, if possible.    
 I own this unit for more than a year. Bought it in the local drug store for $20. First unit was bad, displaying low battary error. I exchanged it same day for another one. I compared readings with traditional thermometers  and found it to be very accurate, fast, and can show in both C and F. The best I've ever had. The case is bad - lock broke in a week 
 A very thorough and perceptive analysis of the Reign of James VI of Scotland, later to be James I of England. Patterson's depiction of James as a conciliatory force within British Christendom is well supported in this excellent period history. Articulate and intellectually stimulating 
 Judy Jance was my neighbor in Seattle when she wrote her first book.  I've read everyone of her books and they are great.Her books are easy to read- and fun mysteries...The Beaumont Mysteries, which take place in Seattle are among my favorites. She also writes a Joanna Brady series (A female Sheriff in Arizona) and now that I live in Arizona, I really enjoy those.  
 It is worth watching multiple times.  Share it with friends and family 
 This is an outstanding book. It really conveys, not only a perspective on evil, but, an answer to it. It moves beyond the philosophical questions and looks at the heart of the Creator God to eradicate evil and rescue the cosmos.   N.T. Wright is an incredible man. He has devoted his life to God's agenda and  His purposes for the world. He is my favorite author, if you haven't read any of his work's I would suggest, "Jesus and the Victory of God". His perspective is revolutionary and authentic. He invite's us to meet Jesus on the sandy roads of the 1st century for the first time. Put all your conclusions in the basement about Jesus and invite Him in.  Wright gives an intimate look at who Jesus was and invites us to experience Him as He was.    Thank you N.T. Wright...amazing! 
 Stephen tackles the prescription drug industry without painting a doom and gloom scenario.  He presents facts in a loving way so that the reader can understand why plants are important.  Stephen sees a problem and offers a solution.  A great book for anyone worried about prescription drugs, on prescription drugs, or interested in plants 
 This book is an amazing way to teach the math concept "factorial" to even very young children.  Anno begins with a jar, which contains 1 island, which has 2 countries, each of which has 3 mountains.  The story continues like this until 10 is reached.  I love the way the pictures are arranged within borders on the page as many times as that of the number of objects being discussed.  The explanation of 10! in the back of the book is also very helpful in the lesson being taught.  Even if children do not understand the concept being taught, they will certainly appreciate the detailed colored drawings and imaginative story! Lots of praise to Masaichiro & Mitsumasa Anno for their creation 
 Wonderful document of the Spin Doctors doing what they do (did) best.  The sound of this live album is in-your-face as hell!  Includes live versions of a few "Kryptonite" tracks like the blistering "Shinbone  Alley" and "What Time is it?", and funkified, rhythmic  "Refrigerator Car".  The real highlights of this album, though,  are the unreleased tracks included here. "Freeway of the Plains"  slinks along smoothly and leads right into "Lady Kerosene",  another unreleased cut.  "Yo Baby" is a funk lovers dream  featuring great drumming and bass playing by Aaron Comess and Mark White,  respectively.  The album closes with what sounds like a soundcheck called  "Rosetta Stone", a beautiful, etherial song with an unforgettable  chorus.  If you're reading this then you're one of the few open minded  people out there willing to take a step back and relish music because it's  really good, despite weather or not it's hip anymore.  I've had this album  for years...and I still love listening to it 
 The Henckels Twin Sharp Duo Knife Sharpener is a must have for any kitchen.  I use it often, to keep my knives  sharp and in great condition 
 This book has really helped me understand my husband. I highly recommend it 
 While perhaps not for those who want a very traditional children's story about penguins, etc., this book has been a big hit in our household. Its somewhat disconnected images and text are not in a linear story--they're meant to give the sense of a dream. And they're well done. 
 This is a spectacularly interesting journal. Cook was an odd sort, that's for sure. But a genius? I'd certainly say so after reading his often-daily account of his activities. Really neat book 
 The stories in this book are great stories that interest and inspire the reader. Charming, sweet and yet all with good humour  and without any irreverence, this book makes an excellent gift for birthdays, Christmas, or if you home educate like me, it's a great book to just have and read at story time in class. It's style is simple and yet entertaining, and the age guide for 9-12 years is good but it could be read aloud to children as young as 4, depending on their attention span. As an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned from it. Hope others enjoy it as much as my family has 
 I'm pretty sure that you _must_ have this book if you are studying advanced organic chemistry. Maybe it's not the best one to use as a study guide, but it's extremely helpful as a reference book both for undergrads and graduate students. However, one can argue that this edition is a bit out-of-date 
 If you want to know what Conservatism is truly about study the underclass. Dalrymple does this like a pathologist. He studies the corpse and from it infers the cause of death. In this case it is Socialism in its most grotesque guise. Read this and weep for a whole generation betrayed 
 I think this book was wonderful.  It stated the basics to get you going then added more detail when needed.  The camera jargon was not overwhelming in any way, and the lighting suggestions were great.  I read through the whole book then went back and highlighted the most needed parts.  I would recommend this book to any parent wanting to take more memorable pictures of their children.  Deserves 5 stars without a doubt 
 When we traveled in Belgium some years ago, we were constantly tempted by chocolate.  There was a Godiva store on every corner with uniform overstuffed waxy tasting chocolates.  Someone suggested we try Leonidas, and it was a revelation!! Half the  price of Godiva's chocolates and lightyears more flavorful and more like the artisanal chocolates that are so popular now.  The flavors were more interesting, the finish more refined, and the dark chocolate more full of cocoa bitterness and depth.  Leonidas is IT as far as Belgian chocolates are concerned 
 For most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate "companion" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman's case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe. Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself. It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later. But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together.      
 As mentioned by other reviewers, the reviewer who stated that this isn't cast iron is mistaken.  This is a traditional, old fashioned, authentic Chinese wok.  If you want a modern stainless steel wok, don't buy this one. If you want the type of wok used in Chinese restaurants, this is it.  The deal offered by the Wok Shop is a really good one and you'll be hard pressed to find this good of a deal on an authentic wok anywhere else.  To learn more about The Wok Shop, the store selling this wok, and Tane Chan, the store's owner, you should read Gourmet Magazine's Dec. 2004 article on the shop. [... 
 There is a very short explication of the title "The Worst Enemy of  Science" in the Preface (pp. v-vi, signed by Gonzalo Munevar), where  it is curtly stated:  "Paul Feyerabend was once described in Nature as  "The Worst Enemy of Science"."  A more detailed reference  than this briefest of mentions is nowhere given in the whole book.  The  book naturally contains (like all Academic books) hundreds of other  (scrupulously) full references of much lesser importance.  What is the  precise Nature reference to Feyerabend as "The Worst Enemy of  Science"?  Or is this a pure legend, perhaps invented by Feyerabend  himself (who loved exaggerations, farcical tricks, and hoaxes of the  "Anything Goes" type) so as to bolster his well-deserved  notoriety 
           One of the classic Disney movies I remembered was the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Reading this novel gave me the same feelings I had in my childhood years watching the movie. I could be wrong but it seems to me that everything in the book was exactly like the movie. Alice was reading her sister's book and fell asleep under a tree. Then she woke up, saw a rabbit in clothes with a clock talking. She then followed the rabbit into this hole. After that she was in a never ending tunnel, which lead her to a strange world. Alice encounters many obstacles in the story and showed how she dealt with them.  	I thought the book was just like the movie. I guess was I was reading the novel made me have a better understanding. I was mainly looking for any symbolism of some sort, but failed to do so. I was also shocked at what the things characters were doing in the book and made it into a Disney movie. For example the Caterpillar smoking a hookah. I didn't know what hookah was until last year. I was really confused in some parts of the novel. This book I thought was great for someone that hasn't even heard of Alice in Wonderland. It is a very thin book but it was like reading a children's book. I thought the novel would have a different story than the movie. From a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it a 7. Just because it was interesting and reminded me of the past. 
 one of cronenbergs best films. if you like any of his films, this movie is for you 
 Have you ever wondered what really happened in Florida during the 2000 presidential elections? Unprecented is an interesting documentary detailing the controversial election results and how the results played out in Florida. The dvd adresses voter irregularities, disenfranchisements, and voter purges practiced by the state of Florida, which were crucial to the outcome of the election. BBC journalist, Greg Palast, provides captivating commentary as he explains the events of the elections in Florida leading to President George W. Bush's first term in office. Unprecedented sheds light on common practices and problems associated with the American voting system. This dvd is a must see for any American of voting age!  
 Voice is perhaps the hardest of the 6 traits to teach.  With my sophomore core English students, I would do 1 voice lesson each week for their warm up and it was amazing how much more accessible that vague idea of "voice" came to both myself and my students over the school year.  The whole English department at my school uses Voice Lessons...9th grade teachers do a certain number, 10th grade, etc.  By the time a student graduates, they will have done all the voice lessons.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any English teacher or teacher who teaches writing (and which teachers don't?!) 
 A great book to self-teach nuclear engineering. Oriented to the advanced student of physics, or the engineer. Starts with a review of particle physics and modern physic basics, ending in the design of nuclear reactors, safety procedures and effects of radiation on living organisms 
 I ordered this DVD & several others & they all arrived in good shape & on time for Christmas morning 
 I had never read anything by this author, but I was anxious to study about how Christianity got to where we are today. I just finished another book "The Domestication Of Transendence:How Modern Thinking About God Went Wrong" by William Placher who dealt with late medival and 17th century writings. So I needed to start further back to have a good foundation for knowledge of Christian thought.  What I discovered in Wilken's book was a well-ordered, easy-to-read narration of much more than a historical account. He explores what is behind the ideas and the doctrines of the time period from the ressurection to the 7th century.  This book was very enlightening and I look forward to further readings on this subject 
 I bought this book for a programing class, because we used linux in the class, and I had very little experience with it. I'm very glad I did, because this book is a great introduction to all the things you need to be productive on a linux system. I enjoyed it so much, I'm thinking about installing linux on one of my home computers 
 Forget all the Guides to Jamaica. If you really want to know how an American might feel living in my country, where "no problem" is the national password, yet a country full of problems, read this little known--at least in Jamaica--book. It captures the undertow of violence as well as the beauty of the place, giving a most realitic and compelling description, albeit in fictional form. You will want to read this book before taking a short or long visit. Though Russell Bank's experience won't be yours, that is, unless you choose to stay 
 This is absolutely one of the best books out there!  I am a teacher and I enjoy reading this book immensely.  The story is fun and whimsical to read.  While one reviewer was "upset" by how the other characters were not very empathetic to Custard's fears and even teased him, I look at this aspect of the book as an opportunity to discuss it with my students and my 3 children.  It's a great springboard into a discussion on kindness and perspective.  Whatever you do, don't pass this one up because of that review.  I was amazed this book had less than 5 stars.  Parents will love reading this to their children.  Also, a great discussion on the true meaning of bravery can ensue as a result of this book 
 This book is great i ve had three copies now i have one in great shape.  The great description of the book and the charcters and the pokedex.  The book has description of the pokemons powers and speciel oppentent type and the weakness  I reccomand you reading this boo 
 I would recommend the book "My Robot Buddy" for kids who like to read science fiction books. The story takes pace in the future, and it has action from the beginning to the end. The story is about robots that look, talk and act just like people do. If you use your imagination it's not hard to believe that this story could be true someday. The book is only seventy pages long, so someone could read it in a couple of days 
 Blaster Death should stick to reviewing Kenny G albums if he can't hear music on this recording. Not only should Spiritual Unity be placed in the top 100 jazz albums of all time I would go as far as to place it in the top 10. Then again, if real art scares you perhaps you should stick with Kenny G 
 somehow i just cannot tire of this movie. soderbergh's style is just right here, not as gimmicky as ocean's eleven and not as waste-of-time as ocean's twelve. it's witty and the pace is really nice, character's develop but are still charicatures, endearingly, and then it's over 
   If you like Sheryl's hits then you will like this cd, I have a cd player in my kitchen and while I am making dinner I listen to it.  I think it is one of the best cd's I have purchased in a while 
 ben harper has struck gold again. anyone who loves (nobody just 'kinda likes' him) ben's awesome gift for writing a quality tune will adore his new effort. by guesting with the blind boys it was always goin to be a lil bit different than his previous efforts. but weren't all ben's albums varying? stick this in that already bulging collection and enjoy some heart felt, soulful and delightfully touching musi 
 I've read A LOT of self-help books in my life, but this one blows them all out of the water!  It totally puts things in perspective, in such a simple way you wonder why you didn't figure it out yourself.  As Steve Ross says in the book, sometimes you just need to hear the right words to be able to see the truth.  Even if you don't get a life-altering attitude adjustment from the book, you'll probably still enjoy it because it's humorous and fun to read.  I don't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy it.  I feel like this book is such a treasure, I've given copies to all my loved ones.  The most recent loved one I sent it to, simply said "this book is life-changing; I'm at a loss for words" - that's exactly how it feels.  I don't think you'll ever regret this purchase!  Additional comment: Yes, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that I couldn't buy the theory that humans are naturally vegetarians.  Humans are omnivores and can eat anything - that's part of why we have survived so long and in all kinds of conditions.  The author makes a strong case against eating meat - but you don't have to agree with him.  This is such a tiny little issue compared to the wealth of information in this book, that I don't think it will detract at all from the experience of reading this book.  Don't miss out on everything else the book has to offer because of a trivial issue like this 
 Lorna Kepler has been dead for 10 months and the police have not come up with any answers as to why that will satisfy her mother Janice.  There is no proof of murder, but also there's no other evidence as to how she died.  Janice goes to Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone to find out what really happened to her daughter.  As Kinsey probes into Lorna's past, she finds out that she was involved in a lot of unsavory activities.  She also suffered from some health problems that might have contributed to her death.  Kinsey places all of Lorna's associates and friends on her list of suspects and her investigation takes her into some pretty seedy places and situations.  The reader remains as puzzled as Kinsey as to who the actual perpetrator is.  When the killer's identity is revealed there are a few interesting plot twists and Kinsey begins to wonder what true justice is.  Also all of the loose ends are not tied up neatly as in most of the Kinsey Millhone books, and some questions remain, even after the last page.  This is an interesting addition to Sue Grafton's widely-read series 
 Adult medicine is not my specialty so when I was deployed as a volunteer to St Bernard Parish, Louisiana as a volunteer I knew I'd be seeing all ages of patients. I needed a good easy to use quick reference and this book was highly recommended and now I know why!! It was very easy to find the info I needed to treat many, many illnesses and conditions that I needed to brush up on. Sharon Dembinski Nurse Practitioner Massachusett 
 I came to this book after reading Case Histories and actually preferred this to that. What a joy to read. Such engaging joi-de-vivre in her exhuberant writing style.  Reminded me in certain ways of Michael Chabon: a similar, obvious love for writing, a natural gift, and obviously born to it. One of my favorite books read this year 
 Koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late 1500s. The career and tactics of this Admiral are still studied at the U.S. Naval Academy, and doubtless those of other nations. The screenplay is based on a couple of novels, so there is some fiction, but the life of Yi Soon Shin was well documented, so there's plenty of fact supporting the story.   If you are not familiar with Korean Drama, it's good to keep in mind that  this is not a Hollywood product, but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non-Hollywood budgets involved, and it's easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told.   It's a long series, but presents an epic with power, depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode.  It would be great also to see KBS make other dramas available for viewing through Amazon, such as "Seoul 1945".       
 Having read the book and been impressed with how author join Poole has distilled into a readable and understandable format, the tactics techniques and ideology of muslim fighters, I have gained a perspective on their tactical methods that I did not have or could not have learned by a generalized study.   Gunny Poole has done the hard work of research for the grunt and special operations soldier. It is a book that gives a TACTICAL perspective explaining the subtleties of the eastern (south west asia in this case) tactical mindset.   As a current Special Forces soldier who has been to both Afghanistan and Iraq I RECCOMEND THIS BOOK.   I am also humbled by the experience and knowledge of those here and elsewhere who have reviewed and reccommended Gunny Poole's books and only offer my perspective from a sergeant's and operators viewpoint.  This book is not meant to give a big picture theorist a perspective on middle eastern culture and geo politics. And rightly so. It is a thought provoking and pertinent study for the soldier on the ground. Fighting the militants (insurgent).  No military study is currently availble that gives the tactical mindset and explains it as Mr Poole has. The only other that comes close is Afghan Guerilla war, a series of vignettes in the words of the Afghan mujahideen, which the soldier then has to try to figure out their tactical method within the given context.  Gunny Poole's Book Tactics of the Crescent Moon is  better way for soldiers to learn the enemy.   If you want a book about US failures and how our real strategy is land and resource aquisition as one reviewer here lamented about, look elesewhere.  This book is for the guy on the ground who will be doing the fighting and the men that will plan and lead those operations 
 Hi,  Very informative book - simple, clear explanation of which parts to chose for the ultimate gaming machine.  But it was published when AMD were in the lead.   I have a simliar machine based on Intel Core Due and I used some of the tips in the book. I didn't build the machine - I let professionals do it for me for additional 30$ but it helped me in understanding and part selection. 
 This book is a great eyeopener on to what really goes on at an animal shelter. I had tears in my eyes the whole time reading about the wonderful cats and dogs that found new homes or unfortunately didn't. It woke me up to how much needs to be done so that no innocent creature goes to the "rainbow bridge" without a chance of ever having a happy home. A great read and I highly recommend it to all animal lovers especially if you are looking for a way that you can help. 
 Jeffrey Tayler, an American ex-pat. living in Moscow, decided, somewhat on a whim, to be the first non-African since Henry Stanley,to navigate a treacherous and long stretch of the Congo River. A bit naively, he seemed to think that he could do this on his own. As soon as he arrived in Zaire, a barely functioning country, he quickly discovered that his journey could not be undertaken alone and would be far more demanding thean he ever dreamed. Facing the Congo is the story of Tayler's adventure in the country then known as Zaire .And what a story it is! Difficult to put down and exceptionally well written, this book, like the best of travel writing,both entertains and educates. You come away from this book with a feeling of profound sadness over the plight of the average Congolese and the tragic waste of the energies and talents of an entire generation of people in the Mobutu era. Tayler arrived in Zaire a rather naive young man and left much wiser and definitely more humble. The reader will do the same. This is really an excellent book 
 This historical fiction piece is an action-pack novel.  It has a strong cinematic flavor with a strong, charismatic presentation of Hannibal.  This is book is great reading for both young and old 
           One of the classic Disney movies I remembered was the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Reading this novel gave me the same feelings I had in my childhood years watching the movie. I could be wrong but it seems to me that everything in the book was exactly like the movie. Alice was reading her sister's book and fell asleep under a tree. Then she woke up, saw a rabbit in clothes with a clock talking. She then followed the rabbit into this hole. After that she was in a never ending tunnel, which lead her to a strange world. Alice encounters many obstacles in the story and showed how she dealt with them.  	I thought the book was just like the movie. I guess was I was reading the novel made me have a better understanding. I was mainly looking for any symbolism of some sort, but failed to do so. I was also shocked at what the things characters were doing in the book and made it into a Disney movie. For example the Caterpillar smoking a hookah. I didn't know what hookah was until last year. I was really confused in some parts of the novel. This book I thought was great for someone that hasn't even heard of Alice in Wonderland. It is a very thin book but it was like reading a children's book. I thought the novel would have a different story than the movie. From a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it a 7. Just because it was interesting and reminded me of the past. 
 I read many many mysteries and read this one with the expectation of a good plot, interesting characters.  I found all that and more.  The book is beautifully written, intricate, thoughtful, funny in parts.  The art metaphor of Still Life worked on many levels.  This book was so much more than I expected.  I bought the book for a friend for Christmas because it was quite possibly the best mystery I read last year 
 If this is a re-mastered re-issue of the show, it might be worth the cost. The first DVD box issues of the original two seasons were grainy and nowhere near the quality of the new, definitive "Twilight Zone" sets (or "The Naked City," for that matter). MGM, please provide more info on this re-issue and whether it's just re-packaging, or an upgrade 
 10 years ago held up in my studio where I did my best to make two books.  Later I studied at Penland School of Crafts in N.C. where I learned to make a book with precision.  I've been making boxes and books since, sometimes I wish I had someone to confer with, that's where "Books, Boxes and Portfolios and Mr Zeier" come in.  It's like having a friend with me in the studio.  Some projects are easy but I would recommend it to someone who has some expierence working with exact measurements, and one who is patient 
 Billy Wiles had a quite life until he is targeted by a psychopath. When Billy finds a note on his car demanding he make a choice, the story takes off and does not slow down until the last page. This book as it ALL, no weakness. A strong hero vs. a wicked vilian, who will win????? Can you figure out who the "freak" is before Billy does...I did....almost....  A great book, hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  
 Another great album from a band whose glory days are ahead of them. All of the dark and desolate enviornment of a post-industrial Manchester is captured in every note of this album. 
 I have bought more of this cd to give as gifts than I can count - no elmo in my car!  I admit to listening to some tracks without my daughters!  really!  highly recommend it for any age.. 
 I recently heard an interview on NPR with Maurice Sendak.  He talked about how this was his first pop-up book. However, he had been very interested for years in 19th century pop-ups, such as the works of the great Munich artisan, Lothar Meggendorfer.  I've loved Sendak's style for years so I was quite excited by the prospects of his new endeavor.  This book is truly beautiful.  Astonishingly so.  It did scare my 2 year old daughter a bit, but she's warming up to it seeing how much enjoyment her father is getting from it.  Good stuff 
 I'm only 16 years old but I love classic singing groups such as DeBarge.  Some of their best hits are "I Like it", "Love in a special way", and my favorite "All this love."  The whole album has great dance songs and love ballads.  Some of the songs might be so-called "poppy" but major rap stars sampled their songs.  Two of their songs that was sampled was "A Dream", and "Stay with me".  El has that perfect voice and Bunny is just the perfect fit for the group.  DeBarge has that choir voices such as their older brothers Bobby and Tommy DeBarge from the group Switch.  From track 1 to 16 all the songs are great from "Rhythm of the Night" to "Stay with Me" 
 The new edition of this book is the best yet, and the only guide I've found that's bang up to date. The maps and photographs look great and the text adds enormously to the interest of any train journey in the US and Canada 
 This is an absolutely superb history of biological thought.  If you want to know what Aristotle thought, the details about van Leuvenhook as he turned his crude microscope on a drop of water (revealing the existence of teeming microorganisms), and the neo-darwinian synthesis (of Darwin and Mendelian genetics), this is your book.  It is unfailingly accurate, beautifully written, and laid out so that it is easy to find what you want at the moment you need it.  I have used this as a reference for years when I needed just the right fact or idea in some article or review.  It is simply first rate, but it is a book to use and apply more than one to read straight through.  Finally, Maye is one of the great biologists of the 20C, a leader in the development of neo-Darwinism, which is a special treat to the reader.  Recommended.  Its excellence will stand the test of time 
 Most of my writing is done with a thick and stubby pencil on a piece of 2 x4 lumber -- I'm a carpenter and for years, once or twice a day, when I measured or cut a piece of wood that was about to disappear into the framing of a house, I'd write a little something on it.  Sometimes just words that I like: "crystal," "ampitheater," "roar."  Other times a line or two about the day, or the place.  My wife bought this book in Middlebury three weeks ago, I've read it every night (I'm a slow reader) and I'm grateful to the woman who wrote it.  She understands and loves words.  I think she wrote this book for people who want to write and publish on paper, but, take it from me, her ideas work just as well on lumber 
 These are my first set of wine glasses, and though expensive compared to sets sold by Ikea, these Riedels are worth the price. I experienced aromas from my usual wine selections that I've never knew were there before. Since receiving these glasses a few months ago, I had the displeasure of drinking wines from glasses of lower quality in restaurants. There was an older review on Amazon from someone who said he brought his Riedel glass to a wine tasting event and I felt like doing the same, but unfortunately, that wouldn't make sense on a regular basis. I am happy with my purchase and I would rather put up with the risk of breaking one and getting the most out of my wines than buying some cheap stock Ikea glasses and not know what I'm missing 
 And actually, the only reason I think I gave it a four instead of a five is that I prefer the three predecessor albums, which I feel were the masterpieces. But make no mistake, "Midnite Vultures" is just as good of an album. While it was intended that way, it does seem like more of a party album for Beck than any of his other releases. Besides, I love listening to tracks where the lyrics just make me smile, and that happens a lot on here. The themes on sex are really tongue-in-cheek and possibly more relevant today than the seven years ago when it was recorded. Also beware, this is like the polar opposite of "Mutations."  A lot of Beck fans hate the song, but "Hollywood Freaks" is a personal favorite of mine. Especially on the bridge when he shouts "Jockin' my Mercedes/Probably have my baby/Shop at Old Navy/He wish I was a lady", I still crack up even after the several listens to the song, a slap in the face kind of lyric to the ridiculous scene of gangsta at the time. This is just one of many examples of the genius of "Midnite Vultures." The tracks are very ranged; perhaps too much for some listeners. However, the overall feel being similar may also turn some off.  There's also the interesting electro "Get Real Paid", which has Beth Orton (good match for a song). Other than "HF", my favorite is probably the catchy single "Mixed Bizness." The album doesn't do much to settle down until the end of the album on "Debra", which has a standout falsetto from Beck.  Besides, if you like to laugh at oversexed pop culture and have lots of fun, "Midnite Vultures" is a perfect album for you. Definitely an enthralling listen 
 This is the book that changed my life forever. I read it many years ago, and it continues to reverberate in my theological practice. Apocalypse means "unveiling." As Keller says, this was the verb of the groom unveiling his bride. The next thing we know, that same groom is tearing open the earth for weatlth and pleasure. Thus economic development is revealed in the dark light of pillage. I have never read such an eloquent plea for the earth and her creatures, the earth itself as the Body of Christ. The book reads like a dream, revelatory, deconstructing the strictures of linear thinking to show its underlying chaos and self-interest. As a result of reading this, I began to do theology as dreamwork, an idea that Keller herself takes up in more recent writings, notably God and Power. 
 Mississippi Masala is indeed a different kind of interracial love story.  It involves a black man (Denzel Washington) and an East Indian woman from Uganda(Sarita Choudhury). When Mina is a little girl, she and her family, along with the Indian population as a whole, are expelled from their homeland with little more than the clothes on their backs when Idi Amin comes into power.  Eventually they settle in Greenwood Mississippi and by this time, Mina is a grown woman.  Her father Jay (Roshan Seth), who was a well off lawyer in Uganda, spends most of his time suing the Ugandan government in hopes of getting his property back and going home.  Her mother runs a local liquor store.  They live in a motel owned by their cousin and Mina helps earn their stay by cleaning bathrooms there.  Demetrius owns a successful carpet cleaning business in Greenwood and lives with his father (Joe Seneca) who buses tables at a local restaurant and his little brother (Tico Wells) who simply hangs out doing nothing all day.  He meets Mina when she slams a car into the back of his van and initially gives her attention only to make his ex girlfriend jealous but finds himself falling in love with her.  When their families find out, it all hits the fan.  Some of the reaction is funny but much of it is very sad as well.    Just as compelling as the love story itself is the relationship between the Indian and Black communities and Jay's own emotional struggles.  The Indians are looked down on by the local whites yet they themsleves look down on the local blacks.  The Indian hotel owner tells Demetrius and his partner that people of color should unite yet forgets his own words when he finds out about Demetrius' relationship with Mina.  Demetius is already resented by some of his own people because of his success and his relationship with a non-black woman only makes matters worse.  Mina's family, already marginalized because of their fall from prosperity and their dark complexions (yes it's an issue among Indians too), are marginalized even more.  Both Demetrius, who thought that Mississippi was changing for the better, and Mina, who always identified with black culture and never had any apparent racial hangups, are unpleasantly surprised by it all.  Before I spoil anything, let me just say that most should find the ending positive and satisfying.   
 One of the best books I have ever read about the holocaust. A serious research and it is indeed a great contribution for the studies on this horrible moment of the history of mankind 
 I just completed three viewings of the Anchor Bay Release of this movie...I was stunnded & awestruck at the sheer beauty of this DVD. Every scene was carefully composed to show off the greatest beauty possible...Pure Eye Candy. The colors were bright and crisp and well defined. The sound quality was superb. One rarelly finds this perfection in this old of a movie 
 This book was the first book my younger daughter chose for her summer reading.  My older daughter and I read it, too.  This story concerns Valerie, who runs away when she discovers her own mother behaving inappropriately with Valerie's boyfriend.  She learns swiftly just how horrifying the life of a runaway can be.  There is magic and a very unexpected hero, and some fairly rough action.  My younger daughter felt some of these scenes almost too intense, though she later said she loved the book.  My older daughter loved Valerie's strength, her struggle to find a moral path in a very nasty world.  I like this book because actions have consequences, both bad and good.  The pacing is brisk, the characters vivid, and the magical glamour is both compelling and creepy.  But I do recommend it to older readers, unless they are ready for strong language and some sexual situations 
 The future is always fun to think about.  Flying cars, moving sidewalks and automated cars were all part of the future at one point.  Let us face facts, Americans think many problems can be solved by science.  The problems of crime, helping the poor, spreading the wealth has all been solved a million times within the books created by sci-fi authors and political thinkers. To me this book seems to be the counter point to A Planned Society by George Soule.  Engineers, managers, numbers, machines and vacuum tubes can only go so far.  Planning everything, assigning numbers and values, putting everybody in their tiny slot in the big picture of civilization is not going to work.  It will never work.  What works in war time does not work in peace time. The only reason I took a point away was the age of the book.  And the death of the kitty 
 When I first picked this up I was a little nervous, I thought how could a sequal to the Time Machine actually work?  It didn't matter to me that it was endorsed by the estate of HG Wells.    I lack the verbal power to describe how good this book is.  Baxter has the power to transport the reader wherever the storyline requires he go.  It doesn't matter if it's a Morlock space station or an alternate world where WWI never really ended.  Several interesting questions are also proposed about the nature of time travel.    Think about it now, how many books can entertain you AND make you think at the same time?  If you are a serious Scifi fan or a casual Scifi  fan get this book as soon as possible you will not be disappointed.   
 This is an excellent resource for all educators.  It is well laid out. Excellent index enables reader to locate specific info quickly. It contains useful appendices to be used as diagnostic and corrective tools.  Includes, strategies, activities, and games.  I highly recommend this book 
 Sam Stern uses an appealing approach to cooking for teens.  I appreciate the fact that he chooses healthy menus and manageable recipes for the events in the teen's life.  He makes it possible for the teen to have fun in the kitchen and serve delicious food for him/herself and friends as the result

 This book is more than advice on skin care. It is a comprehensive guide to Ayurvedic living The author covers everything from nutrition to exercise and body care, explains why the body gets out of balance, how each of the three doshas reacts differently, and how we can regain health. She includes special elimination therapies, fasts, and breathing techniques, and helps you discover your skin type through a variety of quizzes.  The major part, of course, deals with body care and has simple recipes for homemade shampoos, conditioners, cleansers, baths and much more. In fact, so much more that I recommend you give up your job and hire two servants if you intend to follow her daily beauty regimen. Raichur recommends morning exercise (45 minutes), body self-massage (20 minutes), scalp massage (5 minutes), facial care (up to 15 minutes), saunas (or home alternatives, which she describes), nasal rinses, meditation, yoga, and, well, you name it. Although not all procedures need to be done every day, just following her basic daily routine takes more time than most mothers have.   Like other Ayurvedic specialists, she does not explain how people with two dosha imbalances should handle the diet recommendations. She does, however, bring good lists with dietary suggestions for each skin type, and these lists include herbs, food, and cosmetics. (According to the author's principle: "If you can't eat it, don't rub it on.")  Raichur also has her own cosmetics line which is available on the Web. When I discovered that some cosmetics listed the ingredients while others did not, I took out her book again. I was not surprised to see that she includes ingredients in her own cosmetic products that she brands as possible carcinogens or allergens in her book. Again, theory differs from reality.  But in general, her book is a thorough introduction to Ayurveda with lots of advice for healthy living and natural home-made cosmetics 
 Easily one of the most important groups in the evolution of Hip-Hop, through a cross referencing of Jazz & Soul...they were able to crave out a distinguished career, that few could equal their collective talents. Consisting of 'Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Phife Dawg' & rapper prodigy "Q-Tip". Admittedly everyone will be familiar with the seminal "Can I Kick it?", but their music deserves so much more....."Scenario" features `Busta Ryhmes' is a off-forgotten gem. The Spanish guitars of "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo", bristle with Mediterranean energy with rapper Q-Tip supplanting himself as the main vocal throughout the album, with which the other two bounce witty wordplay off....purchasing their earlier albums separately is highly recommended, but if you want all the hits singles in one place, this Anthology beautifully illustrates one of Hip-Hop's most prominent artists 
 This book's advertisement described that "Deluxe leather binding with two-color foil stamping". Yes, deluxe leather is not real leather. It is imitation leather. If you would like to real leather binding, this is not your book. But this book has smith sawn binding. And imitation leather will endure from rough handling. 
 I have criminally overlooked Paul Weller for many years now. I don't own anything from The Jam, Style Council or Paul Weller's solo work. I decided to get "As Is Now" after I saw the video for "From The Floorboards Up" on VH1 Classic/Current. So, without having anything to compare this to I have to say this is pretty good music. There are several affecting songs here like "Come On/Let's Go", "The Start Of Forever", "Pan", "Bring Back The Funk Pts 1 & 2" and "The Pebble And The Boy". Mr. Weller seems to touch upon various topics such as dysfunctional families in "From The Floorboars Up", aging in "The Pebble And The Boy", life changes in "Blink And You'll Miss It", spirituality in "Pan" and so on. This is mature music for mature listeners, and it's great to have an artisit like Weller who is making age-appropriate commentaries and not trying to pander to the younger crowd. He also deftly incorporates blues, rhythm & blues, funk, rock, psychedelica and jazz into "As Is Now", making it a satisfying experience. The only shame is that in America Weller is virtually unknown. In Europe he's huge, and I can see why. If only his music received more attention...  I'm sure Weller fans are enjoying this one, but if you've not heard of him, I suggest taking a listen to "As Is Now" 
 I admit, I am a "johnny-come-lately" (to drag out a very old expression) in the whole "zombie" phenom, and I hope the ignorance of my comments don't offend all the loyal, hardcore zombie loyalists out there - but lately, the world is being over-run by zombies, so it has become something we all need to take seriously.  Of course, I saw all the earlier movies as they came out, so I'm not totally ignorant, but my tastes run in all directions (usually at the same time) so I would watch them, and then move on to the next movie.  It's become very clear that many people latched on to these movies, and then went on to devote their entire lives to this genre - which is fine, for them.  "Shaun of the Dead" is one of those movies that I watch, but I don't really form a complete opinion, so I'll watch it again, and again, and again...and you know what?  I really, really like it!  It IS funny - NOT in the way I have been accustomed to viewing humor, and not really in the British/Monty Python/Fawlty Towers/Young Ones kind of way that I have acquired a taste for over the years.  The humor IS dry and it is very much "tongue-in-cheek", but it is also a little more sophisticated and intelligent than the "Dead Polly Parrot" sketch (which is STILL very funny).  I've read that this movie was put together and intended as an "homage" to the American father of the zombie movement - George Romero (I hope I got that right).  The people who get hung up on gore and can't get past it, will criticize this as being just another one of those "bloody, senseless, body count movies" - to me, that is just being very small minded.  This is a movie, those are special effects, NO ONE really dies in these movies - if they can grasp that, we can move on.  To me it becomes - what NEW twist can we come up with, what NEW method of dispatching someone?  The more elaborate, the grossest, the most shocking, the most original - that is what takes the prize, and that is where the humor comes in.  No one is laughing over death and destruction - this is zombie movie mayhem and the object is to come up with something never before seen, so the audience will freak out in the delight that comes with being caught by surprise.  This movie is a very respectable British entry into the zombie genre - with it's own twist.  I'm sure it will take it's place with all the other recent movies - "Day of the Dead", "Land of the Dead", "28 Days" - to name a few.  As I said, I'm a newcomer as a serious viewer of these movies, but as I begin to appreciate them and their unique humor, I am also adding them to my collection.  Thanks for taking the time to read 
 It is interesting that many Churches place much emphasis on the strict and literal interpretation of the Bible. Isaac Asimov pointed out that the whole reason Jesus clashed with the Jewish authorities was because while they placed strict emphasis on keeping with the strict letter of the law, Jesus' mentality was that it was alright to deviate from the written law if it meant doing a greater good. EXAMPLE: In the Gospel According to John, a woman is going to be stoned for adultery. "Levitivus" 20:10 and "Deuteronomy" 22:22  clearly state death as the punishment for adultery. And Jesus of course told them anyone who was without sin could begin the execution: "...He that is without sin amongst you, let him first cast a stone at her" (John 8:7).  (None of them could.) Paul even warns us about taking the Bible to literally in his 2nd letter to the Corinthians: "...the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life" (2nd Corinthians 3:6). While Bishop Spong explains that the differences between the 4 Gospels often frustrate people, he explains that it shouldn't. The reason is that the 4 Gospels were written for different audiences. Mark basically wrote his Gospel based on the teachings of Peter. Matthew wrote his Gospel in a way that compared Jesus to Moses. He was writing for the Jewish populations, and he wanted to emphasize that Christianity was the fulfillment of Judaism. Matthew also liked to dramatize things. Luke wrote in a memorable and beautiful way. His goal was to make peace with the Jews who became followers of Christ and the Gentiles who became followers of Christ. John's Gospel is on the hostile side. This is because at the time John wrote, many of the followers of Christ were being expelled from the Jewish places of worship. And John wrote in a hostile manner to show the early Christians that God would not be angry at them for leaving their former places of worship. All in all, this is a great book that belongs in the library of any Christian. 
 I usually don't like genre fiction, but this book is a great collection of "Noir" novels. Film buffs will be particularly interested in reading the novel on which "Shoot the Piano Player" was based, as well as the first "Mr. Ripley" novel (much nastier and darker than the recent film). Most highly recommended 
 Before discotheques became discos, when they were still the dim caverns in which a cultural revolution was brewing, every British male between the age of 12 and 25 was in a group, or intended to be.  After the Beatles broke through, every producer wanted to sign a group.  The Beatles, Stones, The Kinks and one or two others made this wave; a host of others rode it.  Somewhere in the wake was a geeky, diminutive, lovable Mancunian called Freddie.  In a less group-obsessed age he and his Dreamers might have remained dreamers, but the time was right for any group that could rattle out a catchy tune.  On their first release, 1963's If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody, Freddie affects a Buddy Holly type twang, rather than showcasing his northern English accent, which most other northern groups did.  Fortunately, this did not last beyond the first record and on their next, the breakthrough hit I'm Telling You Now, he found his true voice.  This song was a big hit in the US, where Freddie's frantic stage moves caused a real stir.  He explained he was 'doing the Freddie'.  They loved it, and he later released a US-only record called Do The Freddie, and 'The Freddy' (they changed the spelling) became a minor dance craze, or crazelet.  Success continued in the UK for just a few years and in 1968 the group disbanded.  Freddie formed other Dreamers lineups and continued doing cabaret right through to the late 90s, when illness stopped his career.  I'm writing this review a week after his death which, I'm pleased to note, was widely reported in the American media.  Alas, only two of the original Dreamers remain.  This compilation is very well done and is great value.  In addition to all the singles, you get notable album tracks and a couple of hilarious oddities like Short Shorts.  At times the band tackled standards and other somewhat more serious stuff, with mixed success.  Fans of Roy Orbison's "Crying" will be doing just that over Freddie's rendition of the song.  At live performances, it became obvious that Freddie had a great personality but no voice.  On these recordings, multiple takes, overdubbing, echo and other technical wizardry (plus session musicians) produce a listenable sound.  No, this is not great music.  But it's good-hearted fun for 60s nostalgics, today's pre-teeny-boppers and anyone prepared to let loose once in a while.  So, shake your left arm and leg, then the right.  Move your head from side to side, take an occasional leap in the air and sing along.  You are now Doing The Freddie.  Go on, try it.  It'll do you good.

 Excellent documentary narrated by lex luthor himself, it acknoledges all of superman's onscreen manisfestations, who knew there was a musical in the 70's? 
 This is a wonderful book, whjich clearly and poignantly tells what Quakerism means to a first-class educator and a deeply decent man. I am a Quaker myself and it rings true; but readers who know nothing about  Quakerism will enjoy it just as well 
 "La Belle Noiseuse", directed by Jacques Rivette, is a splendid albeit admittedly extremely long film that manages to make the spectator understand the possibilities and dangers that are distinctive of art. An extremely good painter can bare the soul of his subject, but that is not always a good thing, specially if the artist's ruthless eye concentrates on the worse moral traits of his model. When is it time to stop? And can a real artist betray himself and his art and not paint what he is seeing?  That is the problem Edouard Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli) faced, when he had to choose between his art and his wife. Frenhofer, an extremely famous artist, decided to stop painting a portrait called "La Belle Noiseuse", because he knew that his model, his wife Liz (Jane Birkin), would hate the results. According to Liz, "He wanted to paint me because he loved me. He stopped painting me because he loved me".  Many years later, Frenhofer gets another chance to finish his painting, thanks to the visit of an admirer, a young painter named Nicolas (David Bursztein). Nicolas suggests that his beautiful girlfriend, Marianne (Emmanuelle Béart), could be the new nude model for "La Belle Noiseuse". Frenhofer loves the idea, as does Liz. Even Marianne, mad at first at Nicolas for his suggestion, ends up embracing the challenge. However, as days go by and Frenhofer and Marianne become immersed in a world of their own, Nicolas and Liz start to feel restless, abandoned. They know that the new painting will make a difference, and that things will never be the same between them and their loved ones. But can they do something? And will it be enough?  Of course, the answers to those questions don't really matter, and you will discover them soon enough if you watch this film. What is important, then? In my opinion, the director wants to show us the process of creation through the eyes of an artist and his model, and the hard choices that sometimes must sometimes be made in order to create a real work of art. Is it worth it? And how much of himself and others should the artist be willing to risk? Those are, from my point of view, the real questions that "La Belle Noiseuse" makes you ask yourself.  On the whole, I can say that I really liked this film, but that I don't recommend it for everybody. If you are just looking for an engaging movie that will entertaing you and make you laugh, "La Belle Noiseuse" is not for you. On the other hand, if you are in the mood for a relatively little known jewel that will amaze and disturb you, making you think, watch this dvd.  Belen Alca 
 I love the Dells. They're great soulful R & B singers with a touch of the gospel infused in their singing. Their songs always sound like they're coming from deep in their soul. I just love...love...love them. I can't say it enough. Every song that they sing is beautiful and touches the heart. I love Stay in My Corner, I Miss You, My Pretending Days Are Over, Always Together...well to tell the truth I like all of their songs 
 As an MFA student and beginning screenwriter, I've found Hot Property invaluable for so many reasons.  First, Keane's accessible explanations of structure are key in terms of establishing instant confict and moving the story along.  In addition, Keane's breakdown of genre has been very helpful in terms of conceptualizing marketing, the pitch, and how to sell a screenplay.  Of all the screenwriting books I've read, Hot Property is the most straightforward and has the greatest clarity--and in a business where you only get five minutes to pitch your idea, I think that's crucial.  Get this BEFORE  you start your screenplay--it'll save you a lot of time and ultimately, your story will be stronger as a result 
 I love these.  They are so comfortable and of excellent quality 
 this contributes a lot for becoming more mature person. It also motivates your understanding on how you weigh consequences and what aspect you are goin to prioritized in terms of trials or difficulties specially in  relationship handling. This also one way of making ourself more human and  help others for being their personhood 
 I am very pleased with the performance of the rechargable battery pack. I have not yet had to recharge it, and I have taken numerous pictures and a few videos. I would have had to replace alkaline batteries at least twice by this time. These should pay for themselves in no time. Why did I wait so long?! 
 If you're considering doing ANYTHING with a horse in it, get this book. It's by far the most complete book on basic horse health, stabling, activities, breeds, etc. (And I do mean "basic".) Would have been five-stars for a glossary 
 Have you ever bought a CD, took it home and popped it in the player only to find there were on a few songs that you liked on it? Well you wont be disappointed with the Eric Benet "True To Myself" CD. You see Eric didnt just put a CD together. He wanted to convey a message to his listeners. I believe every artist put a bit of themself in their music and whether Eric is sharing a bit of some personal reflections or not I believe we all can relate with the tunes on this CD. The music has a urban soulful sound and each songs lyrics has a message to make you reflect on lifes situations. When it all come down to your happiness, your future and decisions. Eric couldnt of put it any clearer be "True to Myself". This is one CD that you'll find yourself playing over and over again 
 I love this book! I have been using it for about 10 years and wanted the new edition. The author explains the energy-based philosophy of Eastern Nutrition in a clear, understandable way. I love the explanation of grains and their value, how to transition to a mostly vegetarian way of eating, fasting, juicing, and so much more 
 We often prefer brand name product such as Sony, Toshiba, or SanDisk and pay much money with strong belief that we got a great stuff. However, due to competition between business companies in global market, most of brand name products are now assembled in China or Taiwan, so the quality of brand name products, in fact, not as good as we think anymore. If we carefully read some tiny words around the UPC Barcode of Kingston SD Memory Card, we can see that Kingston's products are assembled in Japan, so the quality of Kingston Memory card is as good as quality of brand name products like Sony or Toshiba but we can buy Kingston Memory at an affordable price. To spend my money wisely, I prefer Kingston product; great stuff at great price. 
 I didn't get into this book as quickly as the others, but it is still a great part of Laura Ingall's life 
 Lost amongst all the hubbub about the Beatles new, albeit spectacular "Love" release is the fact George Harrison's remastered, expanded "Living in the Material World" is in the stores. Relatively few print reviews have appeared since the late September release, somewhat confusing and very disappointing. Some reviewers obviously will never give Harrison credit; in 'Q' magazine, the writer said this album was one without any classics. What about the worldwide smash hit "Give Me Love"? It sounds fresh, musical and poignant 33 years later! But that's just the first of 13 songs that range from OK ("Try Some, Buy Some") to absolutely stunning (the bouncy single-that-never-was "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long," rollicking title track and the meditative "Be Here Now.")  Simply put, "Material World" is a long-neglected musical gem with brilliant Harrison guitar work throughout (bottleneck slide, acoustic, dobro, you name it) along with the solid underpinning of drummer Jim Keltner and bass player Klaus Voorman. Add to that punch horns from -- who else -- Jim Horn and tasty piano by Nicky Hopkins, especially on the magical "The Light That Has Lighted The World." Harrison also never played better slide guitar than on the Side 2 opener (remember vinyl?) "The Lord Loves The One (That Loves The Lord." Yes, lyrics here and throughout can be viewed as overly preachy, even accusatory toward mortals in the material world. But George is painfully honest in his views, and only wanted to share his spiritual bounty with others. He probably went over the top a bit, but if you can not get caught up in that, you will soak in nothing but sublime pop-rock music at its early-1970s best. Extras are here as well, such as the spare but excellent B-side "Deep Blue," and playful "Miss O'Dell," both never before officially issued. The accompanying DVD is too short, continuing a problem found with previous Harrison releases ("Brainwashed" special edition). But the video of "Give Me Love" from the Harrison-Clapton tour of Japan in December 1991 begs the question "when will the whole thing come out on DVD?" Other features on the DVD are fun (alternate version of "Miss O'Dell" set to a photo montage) and interesting (a short film showing the original albums being pressed). There also is a great booklet with rare photos, lyrics big enough for Boomers like me to read and a two-page spread showing pics of various music trade charts (Billboard, etc.) reminding that both "Material World" and "Give Me Love" were chart toppers on both sides of the Atlantic. When this album came out in June 1973, high school friends and I gathered around a turntable for a listening party. We loved it, but it was a bit of a letdown since NOTHING could ever equal or top "All Things Must Pass." Still, it was on our turntables and in our car 8-Track players all summer. Now, as 2007 beckons, hopefully old George fans will come back to this album by way of this reissue -- and a new generation of fans will sample the Quiet Beatle's most-intimate work and give it the thumbs up it richly deserves. Forget those lazy critics who think it's only a John and Paul world. Give George Harrison and his underappreciated work a new chance! 
 The sweeping symbolizism in the three colors trilogy culminates in the end of rouge, the excellent concluding chapter,  where the major characters from the trilogy are saved. This last story-- involving the seven primary characters from the three movies, who are loaded with the full human range of flaws and problems-- tells how they all recieved the same reprive.    The triology, and particularly Rouge, can be seen as a counterpoint to the conclusions derived from the dreary, sad decologue. It tells us that there is hope, order and purpose in the mayhem and chaos of life. 
 When Ace of Base burst onto the scene, the ABBA comparisons were obvious.  2 guys (mostly the creative force) and 2 girls (one blonde and one brunette who provide most of the vocals) from Sweden.  However, times had changed since ABBA.  ABBA's music was often either spanish-influenced (Fernando, Chiquitita), disco-oriented (Dancing Queen, Does Your Mother Know), or heavily dramatic (The Winner Takes it All, When All is Said and Done).  Ace of Base often fused reggae with the euro-dance sound of the early 90's.  Fusing these genres created an Ace of Base sound that was all their own and really nothing like what ABBA had done at all.  I owned both of Ace of Base's first 2 albums (The Sign and The Bridge) and enjoyed them immensely.  However, with over 1000 CD's in my collection, I started to thin out the heard where possible.  When this Greatest Hits collection was issued, I bought it to replace my other 2 CD's.  However, much to my chagrin, it did not include "Living in Danger" or "Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry".  I HATE it when record companies leave key tracks off of a Greatest Hits compilation.  I love the songs here, but if you are looking for a comprehensive collection that includes all of Ace of Base's US hits, this is not it.  You might try looking for the import version that does include those songs 
 This is the place to start any indepth consideration of country and  western music.  In fact Dr. Malone's survey and Nick Tosche's COUNTRY THE  BIGGEST MUSIC IN AMERICA are my two favorite introductory volumes.  Each  book is radically different from one another with Dr. Malone's history by  far the more authoritative and serious consideration while the Tosche's  book operates more as stream of consciousness fan's notes 
 I would consider this one of the best items I have ever purchased because as a vocal performance major I have to record almost everything I do. The sound quality is great (I use it mostly for lessons). Other than a professional recording I would say that this recorder is pretty much the best thing out there for musicians 
 You can't go wrong with this cookbook.  The dishes are simple to prepare and the flavor is divine.  The pasta with vodka sauce is to die for. I got it as a gift from a friend and we were recently commenting on how this book gets used more than many others. Simple, fresh, flavorful food.  YUM 
 From covering how audits work and how to deal with IRS letters to completing common tax forms to year round tax planning issues, this book covers it all.  Individuals as well as people who need to explain taxes to  the public will find this book to be an A+ resource 
 If you've seen one or two of the Thumb movies and liked them, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this box set.  These hilarious short spoofs of famous movies are packed with laughs and will bear watching over and over.  Every Thumb movie here is a gem, and the extras - the interviews with the 'actors', are very funny too. 
 The only complaint is that this book isn't longer.  This is how it all begins for Bertie and Jeeves, and several of the incidents related become references in the later stories.  Having read this collection after reading some later works, it was interesting to see how it all started.  Brilliant, and as a previous reviewer noted, the only question is what edition of this book to buy.  For the money, this one was perfect for me 
 This compilation is one of my favorites of the Winter Solstice series.  The music is not really oriented towards Christmas Carols, and I really appreciate that.  This one has a wide range of instruments from harp and  solo guitar to the wonderful duet between Keola Beamer on Hawaiian slack  key guitar and George Winston on played, plucked and bowed piano.  Anything  by W.G. "Snuffy Walden" is great.  I wonder why he doesn't have  his own CD?  This is an excellent selection of music for the winter season  without being typecast to a specific holiday.. 
 A definitive work on the combined history of Israel and the Jews from both the New and Old Testaments.    This is the book that sticks in the craw of Reconstructionists and their followers who, as Gary North(Mr. Y2K) has said on many occasions, would love to see democracy in the USA replaced by a theocracy, with home, church and government obedient to the letter of Old Testament Law and see both moden and ancient Israel thrown into the wastebasket of history.  Lindsey correctly identifies the "replacement theologists" in the Dominion Now, Reconstructionist camps and how they have followed the lead of the Catholic Church since 400 AD in teaching that the church has the right to ursurp the  promises and convenants made to Abraham.    Lindsey exposes the subtle attacks on Israel's legitimacy being made by these Reconstructionists and Theonomists who are a very small but vocal part of the Evangelical Christian Church.   Lindsey's scriptural arguments are rock solid and provide the reader with an excellent tutorial on how a small segment of the Jewish community still is in God's plan for the endtimes.    If you've ever wondered how a very small segment of what the media refers to as the Christian Right has tried to turn bible history past, present and future into an anti-semitic diatribe, read this book .    Finally, if you are Jewish(Messianic or otherwise) and want to understand why this group called Dominion Theologists and Reconstuctionists do not represent bible believing Christians who understand and support the true destiny of Israel, read this book.  
 Based on Dave Stevens' graphic novel (which was inspired by "King of the Rocketmen" a movie serial from the 40's), this retro fantasy is a blast (pardon the pun). Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is not so hot. Director Joe Johnston ("October Sky", "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" and "Jurassic Park III")does a nice job with this feature film recreating the look of Hollywood in 1938.  Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) and "Peevy" (Alan Arkin) have put together a cutting edge stunt plane. During a test flight the plane is destroyed in an accident involving the FBI and the Mob. It seems the Mob has stolen a revolutionary rocket packet designed by Howard Hughes (the great Terry O'Quinn)which the U.S. wants to use for military purposes. Unfortunately, so do the Nazi's who hired Mob kingpin Eddie Valentine (Paul Sorvino) to steal it. Secord accidently comes into possession of the rocket pack and suddenly everyone from Hollywood actor/Nazi agent Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) to the FBI want to catch him and retrieve it.  This is a fun witty film of the graphic novel. The DVD transfer looks so-so. The image is frequently too dark and there's lots of digital artifacts (aliasing, etc.) that mar the picture. Presented in widescreen, it's not enhanced for 16x9 sets and doesn't appear to be an anamorphic transfer either. Why does all that matter? Because on a widescreen TV it would have enhanced and improved the picture quality making it look sharp, vivid and alive.  The original theatrical trailer is the only extra. I don't know if Disney has any immediate plans to reissue this but if you do purchase it, be aware that it doesn't look all that great on DVD because of the transfer by Disney.  I'm hoping that Disney will be reissuing this terrific movie because it certainly deserved it. Unfortunately, the film with its loopy charm and srong performances didn't get the audience it deserved and died at the box office. Disney, get off your duff and reissue this as a two DVD Special Edition as it deserves 
 Just as the taste of some "petites madeleines" with tea was the impetus that started Proust on his seven volumed A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, the sight of workmen gathered around a coke fire, served as a similar spark for Anthony Powell's own epic literay effort.  Although the two works differ in the language used to write them and deal with different stratum of society, the similarities are obvious to anyone who has read the two works.  Both are fairly obsessed with the concept of time and how it influences memory and imagination; both authors create elaborate universes, peopled with hundreds of characters and places, which are then minutely examined and described from a vantage point somewhere in the future (the examination and description themselves affected by the passing of time); both dealt obliquely with the idea of war and how it impacts the accepted social milieu, and both works are quintessentially passive in style.  The "First Movment" of the Dance comprises the first three novels of the series and centers on the years immediately following Worl War I through the first part of the 1930s.  Although these years would prove to be momentous in the history of Britain and, indeed, the rest of the world, Powell is less interested in history (compare this to Proust's detailed account of the Dreyfus case) than he is in the human condition.  The four main characters of these three novels - Jenkins, the narrator; Templer and Stringham, school friends who find the adjustment to adulthood difficult; and Widmerpool, the ambitious outsider - seem to exist in a world of social functions and very rarely comment on the historical realities of their time such as the Germany's slide toward fascism or the depression affecting the economic foundation of Britain's world position.  To Powell, the passage of time has more to do with the interaction between people than it does with political and economic machinations.  Indeed, it is Powell's elaborate creation of believable characters that makes the work succeed as it does.  The main characters become so well known to the reader that their actions are almost anticipated in advance, and the cast of supporting actors is brilliantly crafted - Jenkins' iconoclastic relative, Uncle Giles; the inimical literati, Members and Quiqqin; the womanizing artist, Barby; and the pathetic Mr. Deacon.  However, Powell's women characters are not as impressive and, with the exception of Gypsy Jones, seem to be more mannequins (indeed a couple of the women characters are former models) than living, breathing humans.  Predictably, the interrelations between the male characters have more life than those between the sexes.  The sexual dynamics, such as exist, are as passive as the other action of the novel and described in such a way that would not cause even Jerry Falwell to blush.  Powell's style takes a while to get use to, but soon the diligent reader becomes immersed in its languidnesss and, because of the sheer length of the work, begins to feel the various rhythms of one's own music of time 
 I have owned it all and this is the best by far.  Nothing and I mean nothing sticks to these Pots and Pans!!!!!! I bought everything in the lin 
 This book is a gem! Having a longtime interest in the SF Quake, I look forward with great interest to new books, and recently there have been a few. This one is unique in that it offers a well written text with rare glimpses of the event through steroscopic scenes. Mr. Burkhart must have spent numerous hours hunting for these never before seen photos that capture that tragic day so perfectly. Thoroughly researched and beautifully presented, I would receommend this book to seasoned historians as well as casual readers. 
 It seems like Sade blesses us with her melodic stylings every 8 years or so, but her music is always memorable, and touches the deepest confines of my emotions and soul (it's definately not pop music).  I had the pleasure of seeing Sade live at Jones Beach years ago, she performs barefoot and appeared to be in her natural element on the beach, this all made the experience all the more sensuous, my date and I loved it. That whole night seemed on the verge of a major downpour, and this venue has no rain cover, needless to say this enchantingly beautiful lady and her music, kept the inclimate weather at bay, all night long, just providing a cool mist to keep us refreshed.  I guess Sade has been catogorized as a contemporary jazz artist but her music transcends normal parameters of classification. I put this CD on when I need spiritual healing. I just kick back with the headphones in effect and listen to track 7 "The Sweetest Gift" (dedicated to her child) and track 11 "It's Only Love That Gets You Through" over and over and over again. Track 1 "By Your Side" was the first song released after an excruciating long hiatus (8yrs), it was a hit immediately. I hope and pray that we don't have to wait much longer for this true musical angel's, return.   
 Anyone who has read "On Killing" knows that Col. Grossman knows his stuff on this topic.  "On Combat" is a new look at this topic with many updates and some new ideas, including more original research into the mental processes that take place in the mind of a warrior during combat situations.  The authors also look at the mental processes of 'recovery', why recovery sometimes goes wrong, and compare the homecoming of the veterans of the various 20th century wars to look at the results of Vietnam vs the other conflicts.  Combat stress and ways to minimize it are discussed, as well as the etymology of psychological casualties in combat.  And as always, the trainer comes out in Col. Grossman throughout the book.  I was able to attend a conference recently and hear Col. Grossman speak.  If you ever have the opportunity to go to one of these, DO NOT pass it up.  He is one of the best speakers I've ever heard, and he'll completely engage you on this topic.  In my opinion, EVERY cop, school administrator, teacher, and other LE personnel in America should be required to attend one of his seminars.  If this were to happen, it could almost eliminate the threat of another major terrorist attack in this country.  We need more sheepdogs!  Hooah 
 This is a tremendous book, one that I would recommend to anybody that has either spent some time in Siberia or that is simply interested in the region. Indeed, one of the few criticisms that I have is that the book is too short. Thubron glosses over a lot of interesting places. He is undoubtedly more interested in peripheral, off the beaten track places than he is in major cities. He barely describes places such as Novosibirsk, the largest city in Siberia and the third largest in Russia. He similarly doesn't spend much time describing cities like Omsk, Ekaterinburg, and Krasnoyarsk, and he doesn't even make it to Vladivostok. Thubron's forte is describing life in places forgotten by Moscow and unknown to the outside world. I've long been fascinated by Siberia and have spent many hours poring over maps, identifying population points in the far north and wondering how on earth anybody could live there. Well, Thubron visits such places and portrays the difficult conditions of life there. He spends nearly a month in a small town near the Arctic Circle. Since there are obviously no hotels there, he finds a bed in the hospital. He describes how every night the drunks knock on the doors and windows trying to get inside so to find a warm bed for the night. The local doctor is a highly educated man who could have had a successful career in any of Russia's larger cities, and it is fascinating to read his story of how he ended up in this godforsaken place. Thubron also describes how Soviet planning destroyed many of the traditions and ways of life of the native peoples of Russia's far north. The author has a fine ear for detecting racism in his discussions with ordinary Russians, whether it is directed against the ethnic minority groups whose traditions were altered under the Soviets or the Chinese who have immigrated in large numbers to Russia's Far East. Among the more interesting parts of the book is Thubron's stay in Birobidzhan, the capital of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast' in the Far East. This region was originally established to serve as a homeland for Russia's Jews, and many Jews from abroad immigrated there in the early Soviet period. Thubron describes how most of the Jews have emigrated to Israel and those still living there are planning to do so as soon as they find the means. Whatever semblance of a Jewish community that existed there in the past has pretty much evaporated. Thubron also visits a community of Orthodox Old Believers in the Republic of Buryatia and describes how they are trying to hold on to their traditions amid the social upheavals that have engulfed post-Soviet Russia. The book ends with Thubron's visit to Kolyma, the infamous prison camp during Soviet times. He provides a chilling account of the atrocities that occurred there and it is simply eerie reading his description of the buildings that still stand. Overall, Thubron does not provide a great deal of direct political analysis. Rather, his tactic is to understand how the tumultuous events of Russia's history, both recent and distant, have shaped the lives of ordinary people. Thubron is at his best when he lets these ordinary people speak for themselves and relate their experiences. This is truly a great book for anybody interested in Russia, past and present. I only wish that Thubron would write a sequel to this work 
 I've never before read a book that contains such a wide variety of experiences, writing styles and outlooks.  This anthology does not shy from confronting the horrors of abusive families, as is evident from the first line in the book: "healing is my own anticolonial war."  But it's also incredibly inspiring for the ways that all of these children have survived to tell such wrenching stories in complex, jarring ways.  As a parent, it was difficult to get through many of the essays, but always I found an incredible burst of hope when I least expected it.  As a survivor of childhood abuse, I also could see my story being told in so many different ways.  Unlike most books that address childhood abuse, every story in this anthology is stylistically challenging, innovative, and carefully crafted.  I highly recommend it.  
 Jack Black has an uncanny ability to sell a movie. A movie that otherwise would have fallen flat. But it's Black's performance that saves "Nacho" from being just another silly underdog story, with an ending you can see coming from a mile away. Black is truly funny as the lonely cook at a small monestary, with big dreams of being a great wrestler. The movie is over the top and silly, but worth seeing simply because of Black's joyful performance 
 Haunting and captivating. Her range and ability to bring life to different genres is truly amazing. This is my third in the collection and I continue to be impressed with each new record -- and that's not only because I lived in Bowie. She truly had talent 
 When my local public library purchased Professor Jenkin's study of anti-Catholicism I was ambivalent.  I checked out the book with the intention to skim through it, but soon I began to more deeply read individual chapters, and eventually ended up reading the entire book.  Prof. Jenkins (a non-Catholic) presents a solid and balanced portrayal of the radically changing face of American anti-Catholicism, as well as how American Catholics have both combatted and contributed to this anti-Catholicism in the past and present.  The superficial similarities and profound differences between modern anti-Catholicism and past prejudice is simultaneously astounding and unsurprising.  The only book I know which surpasses this one in presenting the history of American anti-Catholicism is out of print ("John F. Kennedy and American Catholicism").  Coincidentally, that other work was also written by a non-Catholic (a Jewish scholar to be exact).  I highly recommend this book to Americans of all backgrounds who wish to understand the story behind American anti-Catholic prejudice today 
 "Silk" is a delightful little booklet, easy to finish in a single sitting. I have read it a couple of times, eager to tunnel through to its deeper messages. Because it is obvious to me - and Baricco tells us as much - that "Silk" is more than just a quirky love story. It pays to read a bit further afield in Baricco's oeuvre to get a sense of what this author is after. After having read "Silk", "City", "Ocean Sea" and "Lands of Glass", it seems to me that the common thread linking all these stories is man's confrontation with the Real. I am borrowing Lacan's concept of the Real to denote something that we, as human beings, cannot speak about. The Real is beyond language. It is a primeval state of completeness that is inaccessible to the unstable, contingent linguistic order to which we are confined. In Baricco's stories, the Real emerges (or breaks into our life world) in various disguises, be it in the shape of nature elements (the sea, the wind, endless space), or "unreadable" personalities or artefacts (the shoe heel in "City"). In "Silk" the Real appears "at the end of the world" in the form of an enigmatic (Japanese?) lady. She stares Hervé Joncour, the protagonist, in the face without ever uttering a word ...  Baricco's genius resides in his capability to wrap this confrontation between the Real and our imperfect linguistic order in brillantly suggestive metaphors: building cities, telling stories, writing film scripts, boxing, playing soccer, building railroads, painting, scholarly investigating the very edge of the sea ...  all areas of human activity are pervaded by the endless, precarious struggle to come to grips with the abundance of the Real. It is these metaphors around which many of his Baricco's stories are wrapped. And his carefully crafted, limpid prose helps to convey the fragile humanity of this struggle.   Interestingly, Baricco not only zooms in on the obviously creative, artistic endeavours of human beings as expressions of this confrontation. Also the world of business can be an arena in which we face up to our fallen state. Baricco has a weak spot for visionary entrepreneurs whose primary motivation is not making money, but making a living through epic and quixotic ventures. Mr. Rail in "Lands of Glass" is an obvious example. And Hervé Joncour in "Silk" belongs to the same class. Joncour is first and foremost a merchant in silkworms, a trader, a businessman. At a certain level, "Silk" could be read by students in business administration as an interesting case, describing the bumpy ride of an economic sector in response to technological developments (Pasteur, the opening up of the Suez canal, artificial silk) and political dynamics (in several sourcing areas, notably Japan).  Hervé Joncour mediates between this prosaic world of business and the irreducable surplus of the "world out there". In describing Joncour's resulting process of personal transformation, Baricco's is playing on some decidely Buddhist themes. Indeed, Joncour turns into a virtuous person, a "boddhisattva": quietly disengaged from his own fate and acting virtuously, not out of habit or calculation, but out of extension or empathy with the "whole system" (as is revealed by the episode where he saves the local community by inviting them to join him in building his personal garden).   As Baricco tells us: the story starts with a man that goes to the end of the world and it ends with a lake that is just lying there, on a windy day. The lake, with its fluttering of light on its ever changing surface, is an apt metaphor for what is called in Buddhist tradition "sunyata" or emptiness. Joncour has let go of his ego and embraced the ephemeral groundlessness of the self and the world. The last sentence of the book is "Once in a while, on windy days, he walked down to the lake and looked at it for hours. There he had the idea that he saw, sketched on the surface of the water, the inexplicable and luminous spectacle that his life had been".  I haven't spoken about Hélène, Joncour's wife. She embodies the Symbolic, the volatile and inescapable network of pre-defined sign systems that defines the perimeter of human culture. It is Hélène who writes that long, mysterious letter and Baricco stresses its sign-like, almost abstract character by describing the leaflets filled with Japanese characters as a "catalogue full of marks of little birds' feet, put together with accurate madness". The letter is a desperate, doomed attempt to close the gap between the Symbolic and the Real. Speaking about Hélène's attraction to the mysterious Japanese lady, Mme Blanche says to Joncour: "You know, Monsieur, I believe that, more than anything else, she longed to be that woman." Closing the gap can't, however, be done. Just as Hervé is married to Hélène, we are indissolubly linked to our linguistic order. But there is a profound ambiguity underlying this relationship. Joncour is unwaveringly loyal to his wife as he knows he has no real alternative. There is also an element of seduction at work as exemplified by Hélène's melodious voice to which Baricco keeps drawing our attention. The symbolic order never ceases to exert its siren call on us, wrapping us into an illusory, narcistic cocoon of our own making (what Lacan has called the Imaginary). But there is a price to pay for this infatuation: the marriage between Hervé and Hélène is sterile; the couple does not beget any children .. 
 Just about everytime EW&F broke new ground in the mainstream from any album, their follow-up release would attempt to pull back in an effort to recapture some of the group's true essence. Spirit, Faces and this album are all perfect examples. Powerlight is the successor to 1981's Raise!, which was a commercial comeback album of sorts for EW&F. The incredibly glossy acoustics, futuristic sound effects and formulaic rhythms that made Raise! a success were combined with the meatier instrumental and vocal contributions that Raise! was missing, laying an intriguing framework that I'm sure the "shiny suit men" thought couldn't miss...  "Fall In Love With Me", the lead-off single, while dance-floor ready, immediately sets a laid-back tone and clarifies EW&F's direction for this album as R&B, one of their many mastered genres. Unfortunately for the pop fans gained from Raise!, this cut would be the closest EW&F would come to sticking their necks out for them on Powerlight. Hey, sucks to be them! Because in terms of R&B/dance cuts, this album is brimming over with jewels like the hard-driving, vocoder-assisted "Spread Your Love", the breezy "The Speed Of Love", and the funked up "Hearts To Heart". The ballads are near-mint, with the gorgeous "Side By Side", "Straight From The Heart" which at first sounds like a re-re-hashing of "After The Love..." but finds its own identity, and the lullaby-like "Miracles". Yes, those kids sound real, real bad at the end, but if they just stopped the music beforehand, it might not have been taken so seriously.   Personally, I love this album, even as underrated and un-classic as it may be. The beefed up bass and high-impact vocals actually helped this album achieve a harder edge than the immediately preceding albums, without having to move 100 miles an hour or having to reinvent the wheel creatively, as was done on Raise! This album is very much EW&F, but the following changes led them in the wrong direction:  - Starting with Raise!, The Emotions became mainstays in the band, guest starring more often and contributing background vocals more frequently. On Powerlight, you can hear them on just about every song. By the next album, Wanda & Co. would take over the background and actual group member background vocals would be all but absent.  - The computer effects, in addition to stagnating musical creativity, were also being used to distort live vocal and instrumental performance on Powerlight, which should not have to be done with this group, which is known for its skills in both areas.  Anyway, you do not need to be a hardcore fan to appreciate this tight package. Powerlight takes EW&F's nuances of the '80s and offers them in rare form back to their core audience. If you already own this album and don't see its value, give EW&F's following release a listen, then clutch your shining Powerlight just a little bit tighter 
 This is trully a fantastic book.  Many folks get turned off by the book because they might be under the impression that it is a get rich quick type of book, but it really is not.  Mr. Andrew provides rock solid ideas and reveals many money myths that most financial planners and the general public are just not aware of.  If you trully want to understand how personal finances work and how they can be leveraged to achieve the highest potential returns along with the tax benefits to go with it, this book will educate you on that.    I highly recommend this book to anyone that has been misguided by HR managers, and so-called financial experts that are so prevalent in the media and on the internet.    Also Missed Fortune 101 is a simplified version of the original Missed Fortune book.  More details and the mathematical proof of everything Mr. Andrews writes about is in that book.  Enjoy and be prepared for a wealthy retirement 
 Mihaly is a psychologist and a great author. The present book builds upon his previous book "Flow". Where "Flow" is highly philosophical and little bit difficult to comprehend, the "Good Business" is much easier to go through and understand. The book is about creating meaningful jobs where employees can experience flow and thus happiness. Flow is a situation where one is deeply involved in what ever one is doing. Such experiences not only generate job satisfaction at one hand, but on the other hand they also lead to better financial performance of organizations. But most organizations tend to promote profitability at the expense of employee happiness and well being. This book presents a guideline as to how our jobs should be designed and how the future businesses should be run.  It's a great thought provoking book a must read for any one who is seeking to explore the relationship between work and satisfaction. 
 This is by far the best book on household management that I have ever read!  Some of Bonnie McCullough's ideas would take more time than I have or choose to spend cleaning, but she also offers a number of very practical, time-saving tips that I have implemented into my own life 
 I think I was suppsoed to read this book in High School and I either didn't or i watched the movie instead. Either way, I am glad I finally did.  This book is one of the best ever written.  It makes me sad to think that so many people have not and will not read it.  Harper Lee was ahead of her time in so many ways.  Buy this book. Read it now. Go 
 I first read this book in college, and I've continued to refer back to it since I've been screenwriting professionally.  It's loaded with tips to make your work better, AND to make it professional 
 At 20, Rebecca dropped out of college to marry a widower with three small daughters. A year later, Rebecca's had a baby of her own, and just a few years after that, she's widowed herself. Now, in her early fifties, Rebecca is fairly resentful at having sacrificed what she feels would have been her "true life," putting the needs and wants of her inherited family ahead of her own. For once putting aside everyone else's current dramas, Rebecca tries reconnecting with her college sweetheart...finding, of course, that life with him wouldn't have been perfect, either.  Depending on how the reader chooses to interpret Rebecca, she comes across as either introspective...or too inwardly whiny, while being outwardly Sesame Street-cheerful. I saw her as a mix of the two. While anyone can relate to that inner panic at wondering what happened to the life you once thought you'd have, it can sometimes be pretty painful to have to listen to someone else ramble on about it.  Overall, an introspective read, that gives much to consider 
 As a big Kendalls fan, Jeannie's voice is just as sweet as it was when she and her late father Royce first sang "Heaven's Just A Sin Away".  Even though Jeannie gets plenty of help in the harmony department (Alan Jackson, Ricky Skaggs and Rhonda Vincent), Royce will be greatly missed.  We are indeed lucky to hear him on two tracks before his untimely passing.  I hope to hear a lot more from Jeannie Kendall 
 Songcatcher is a tribute to those of us who grew up in the mountains. I felt so connected to my heritage and enjoyed everything the movie had to offer. The music was spectacular and reminiscent of wonderful childhood memories. If you are not a resident or pass resident of the mountains this is a movie that will enlighten you to the slow pace of life that has never been forgotten and is still lived today 
 This is a fundamental book for everyone who is in a committed relationship with Christ and who wants to deepen their communion with Christ on a daily or hourly basis.  It is an essential book for anyone's personal library 
 Just like other Russell products.  My husband is over 400 lbs., and tall. Not all tall clothing is as long in their tops as Russell is.  Of course this is not a zip-up.  A pull-over is not supposed to zip up. It is not a heavyweight, but both my husband and I like them.  In fact I came back to this site to buy some more.  In tops for my big and tall husband, we only want Russell. 
 When you hear leftist MIT professor Noam Chomsky talking about "the deadly effect of US-imposed sanctions on Iraq," you squirm a little, wondering.  Then you read many credible sources citing the death of over one million innocent people (including some 5oo,ooo children) as a result of these sanctions.  This makes you cringe a little more, but you still wonder about the reality of it all.  Although this book does not furnish any photos of children with one mutant eye bulging out their head from exposure to depleted uranium radiation, it does nonetheless paint an accurate picture of the current situation.  (Btw, I was exposed to footage of "dumpster babies" and mutant children in Japan, so you can take my word when I say that you wouldn't want to see such photos anyway.)  Moreover, the book will provide you with the most up-to-date information about the sanctions available in print.  If Iraq, biological warfare or sanctions are issues that interests you, this book is not to be passed up 
 I bought this baby back in 1999 when I lived in Texas. I'm now 19 yrs old and living back in the place I love: The San Fernando Valley, and for the past 2 yrs, I've been checking out this book over and over. It helps by letting me know about movies I could have passed up if i didn't know about them. Every cult movie I can think of is in this book. It's a great guide to have in your book collection (mine include such books as bios on David Lynch, Tim Burton, A Clockwork Orange, etc.). Also, it's great to have this book by your side on those boring Fall nights. Gotta get it 
 This is the question I kept asking myself as I read through Oscar Wilde's book. The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: "The surest cure for vanity is loneliness."  - by Simon Cleveland 
 All my life I was taught to revere Shakespeare as poet and genius and to treat his work with reverence and pious respect.  Then, I read Stoppard's work and I have never looked back!  RGAD broke down so many bariers that had been fortified for ages in my mind.  Stoppard was able to show me like no one else that Shakespeare was an entertainer. He was one of the greatest of his age, but he was just a man like any other.  He would have sacraficed iambic pentameter for a laugh or a piognant pregnant pause if it meant his work had more impact in a moment. 
 This is one of the rawest cds out from no limit beside Mac shell shooked. Young Bleed and Mac cds I can listen to them and just ride out. I reminds me when I used jam this in the streets of Jackson,MS. I think I'm gone cop this tommorrow along with shell shooked. 
  Red Dragon was groundbreaking when it came out in 1981 and has been the benchmark used by literally hundreds (maybe thousands) of crime novels since.   Reading the novel today, it does feel a little dated (some younger readers may have no idea that home movies were once shot on 8mm film & shown on movie projectors)  but Red Dragon still stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of copycat novels that have followed in its wake.   The plot: Will Graham a former FBI profiler who was nearly killed catching Hannibal Lecter is asked to return to the fold and help the FBI catch a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (at least by the media).  The Tooth Fairy (who calls himself Red Dragon) murders entire families in their homes and shows a propensity to bite some of his victims.  Reluctantly Graham enters the investigation, forcing himself to enter the mind of a killer.  Readers expecting this to be a novel about Hannibal Lector may be disappointed.  Lector plays a much smaller role in Red Dragon than he did in Silence of the Lambs.     Red Dragon is well written and provides fascinating insight into the behavioral sciences arm of the FBI and into the mind of a sociopath.  Harris has crafted the ultimate page turner (not quite as compelling as Silence of the Lambs, but almost).  I highly recommend this novel.  One of the best crime novels ever written and certainly one of the most influential.    
 `Italian Food' is one of the three major books Elizabeth David wrote in the first five years of her culinary writing career, the other two being `French Provincial Cooking' and her first, `Mediterranean Food'. The titles of two of these three books, being about `Food' and not strictly about `Cooking' is very telling of the fact that Ms. David's major books on food are simply not like any other writer of her generation.  For starters, it is a mistake to see Ms. David as `the English Julia Child'. While Julia Child was possibly the most outstanding teacher of cooking methods writing in English, Ms. David was the most distinguished scholar of English, French, and Italian cooking methods and cuisine. The hallmark of that difference was that while Julia Child reworked and expanded traditional recipes so that no detail was left to chance for the amateur American cook, Ms. David goes to equal lengths to describe exactly how Italians really cook, down to the marked inexactness of their measuring.  Unlike all the great modern writers in English on Italian cuisine such as Marcella Hazan, Giuliano Bugialli, and Lydia Bastianich, Ms. David not only gives us a survey of Italian ingredients, recipes, and methods, she gives us a critique of them as well. Can you possibly imagine Marcella Hazan saying that the Italians generally do not cook eggs very well?  Note that Ms. David is as rigorous about her giving the correct Italian names to things as the very best of the Italian writers, but unlike the Italians, she is really seeing Italian cooking through French colored glasses. Today, we commonly think, for example, of a frittata as a distinct type of dish. Ms. David translates `frittata' into `omelet'. Her description of the technique is perfect, something even Mario Batali would be proud to quote, but he may object to the interpretation of the dish as seen by `the F country'.  The importance of Ms. David's achievement, which required a full year's research in Italy, can only be appreciated when you realize that she was working in a climate of opinion in England which saw Italian cuisine as very dull, being nothing more than variations on pasta and veal. As we are well aware today, Ms. David found an enormous wealth of regional diversity in ingredients, methods, and even language, as the same pasta shape can be called three or four different names in different parts of the country.  Since this is a critical and analytical look at Italian cooking, it is done by type of dish rather than by region. And, the book is not intended to be a `complete' survey of Italian dishes. There are a few well known dishes such as `pasta puttanesca' or `timbales' which are not here, and some, such as `spaghetti alla carbonara' which are found under a slightly different name, `Maccheroni alla carbonara' (which is actually more appropriate, as many types of pasta shapes are done with this eggy preparation).  One of the many things that stand out in this book is how well Ms. David's personality and point of view come out on practically every page. In a recent competition for `The next Food Network Star', the judges stated over and over that the contestants must project who they were while presenting the culinary material. Like her great contemporaries, M.F.K. Fisher and Julia Child, this is certainly one thing which Elizabeth David does to great effect. I was especially pleased when she spoke of her connection to the much older travel writer, Norman Douglas. While Ms. David's biography did not clearly reveal the source of Elizabeth's love of food and food writing, the statements in Ms. David's own `Italian Food' make it clear that the elder Norman Douglas was her primary mentor in establishing her professional interest in food and writing about it at a very high standard.  Ms. David's high standards are evident when you compare her writing with that of Tony May in his recent handbook, `Italian Cuisine' where I found several mistakes in identifying ingredients. While the culinary content was sound, Mr. May, and his publisher's copy editors, had relatively low standards for factual accuracy.  A quick look at the back of `Italian Cooking' confirms the fact that this is more a work of scholarship than of a simple book on cookery. There are appendices of bibliographies on both cooking and tourism and notes on wine. One may need to be a little careful with any references, especially on wine and travel, as much in this area has changed in the last 50 years.  Short of stumbling across an autographed copy of the hardcover edition with the original illustrations, you will want to refer to the revised edition, first published by Penguin Books in 1963, as this edition incorporates most of the footnotes into the main text, as the footnoted material was largely segregated due to the 1954 rationing of food in England.  While Ms. David had several major culinary writing disciples, especially Jane Grigson and Claudia Roden, I believe the only place you will find writing at her level of scholarly criticism is from the leading modern columnists such as John Thorne, Jeffrey Steingarten, and James Villas.  You may not want to cook from this book on a daily basis, but as I have, I believe you can use this as your primary source of Italian recipes, and be all the wiser for choosing this volume. 
 I am old enough to remember reading the excerpts of Robert Creamer's biography of Ruth that were published in Sports Illustrated.  While there has been some interesting books on Ruth since Creamer's - especially The Babe In Red Stockings - The Big Bam comes close to matching that timeless classic.  Leigh Montville fills in parts of the portrait of the still mythical sports hero, while painting a picture of a legend created as much by a slick publicist and a newspaper that built its readership on the antics of Ruth as it was by his redefining how the batter played the game.  The introduction was interesting, as it centers on the race in the early 1970s to be the first author to get a new Ruth biography published. While there are enough antidotes to keep any reader fascinated, Montville does a great job covering the last several years of Ruth's baseball career and his seemingly forced retirement from the game.  While it can be argued whether Ruth would have amassed such offensive numbers in a truly integrated professional league, it can't be argued that it remains truly amazing that a player who last put on a uniform about 70 years ago is still considered by many as the greatest of all time.  Now that is truly a Ruthian feat.  
 George C. Wolfe's play details the African-American experience, shocking the reader more and more.  This shock is meant to portray the outrage and sheer madness that the situation of blacks in America provokes.  Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes electrifying and political, this play is a masterwork that attacks various issues in African-American life 
 I'll make this short and sweet.  If you like the Ying Yang Twins you will love this album.  It has a different feel but it is still 100% Ying Yang.  The various producers bring a fresh vibe to the proceedings.  In a year that has been suprisingly hit and miss for Hip-Hop this set is one of the hits 
 I love Laurie Notaro's books.  This is her fifth (and unfortunately, her shortest) book to date.  I laughed out loud many times while reading this book as I did when reading her four other books.  My only complaints about this book are (1) it was too short and now I'm jonesing for her to release another title, and (2) three of the stories were repeats from prior books, meaning I'd already read them but because I love her and the book was so short, I re-read the three repeated (and retitled) stories anyway.  I just can't get enough of Laurie's books!!  If you like Hollis Gillespie, you will love Laurie Notaro 
 I would like to begin and say that this book was published on June 1, 2000, over a year before September 11th happened.  With that being said, Flynn has written a sharp, entertaining thriller featuring Mitch Rapp, an undercover assassin who takes care of the dirty work of terrorists for the United States (without actually belonging to the CIA or FBI).  And this book deals with terrorists, who have Al-Qaieda and Iraqi/Sadaam Hussein ties (sound familiar?!), and who have a vision of making the United States suffer.  Flynn gives us great detail on how the terrorists plan on taking over the White House and gives us realistic scenarios of how this is done (although he said he changed aspects of the real White House so that terrorists wouldn't get any ideas).  And Mitch Rapp (think of him as Jack Bauer in a book without a whiny daughter that gets in his way) is the only one who can save the day.  Without ruining what will happen, Flynn writes a Tom Clancy-like book (with a lot of details in which I learned A LOT - but still not as detailed as Clancy) that is action-packed.  You will be rooting for the good guys (I hope!) and the ending will not disappoint.  As this is a series, read this book first.  Then read these: -Third Option -Separation of Power -Executive Power -Memorial Day -Consent To Kill -Act Of Treason (coming out 10/10/06)  A great thing about Flynn, is that he is a conservative Republican, so you will not get the liberal spins that can ruin good books (like David Baldacci's Camel Club!).  He actually writes it like it is (with a little bias, but at least it is like a breath of fresh air).  But don't expect to see any movies get made from these books.  Flynn said in an interview that liberal Hollywood thinks his books would make great movies, but because of his stance, no one wants to risk supporting a conservative Republican.  So much for making the best, entertaining movies possible!    In conclusion, give this series a try.  Read this book, and if you like it, you'll have a lot of reading to do to finish the series 
 This book covers +1000 deep sky objects plus solar system objects for binoculars. It includes many faint objects that can be seen with ordinary binos under very favourable conditions so the observers with large  binoculars can use this book better. Although there are +1000 objects given  in the book, most of them are not explained but rather their basic data  like coordinates and magnitude are given. It does not have maps so you need  an atlas with this book. However; this book is very useful with its  tabulated data and constellation-based organisation. You cannot find any  other complete and well prepared list and data of objects visible in  binoculars. The author also groups Messier objects into 4 difficulty groups  which is helpful for inexperienced observers 
 So, Ann must be making sense 
 This was a great book.  Some scenes left me teary-eyed from laughing, and some that were very poignant.   A nice reflection on life's up's & downs from a small town perspective 
 A great pleasure for the armchair traveller and gourmet. And how nice to read about a less common part of France, the Lot, rather than the ubiquitous south of France. My only criticism is the sloppy proofreading in the hardbound first edition 
 "Arabian Nights" is as good as any of the books in the Fables series, but the entire sequence read like a prelude to future volumes. Nothing happens in this latest installment to significantly impact the war against the Adversary, nor are there any major changes in the established cast, though we see a lot of new characters introduced who will no doubt play major roles in the future.  There are basically two stories in this volume. The first concerns the arrival of a delegation of Arabian Fables in New York, led by Sinbad. We've seen references to non-European Fable lands in previous volumes and knew that the Adversary had already begun his invasion of the worlds of the Arabian Fables. Now we learn that the Arabian Fables are quite aware of the threat, but still have not decided whether or not to ally themselves with the Fables who have fled to Earth.  There are a lot of culture clashes and the requisite amount of treachery and bloodshed, along with a few subplots highlighting the personal lives of Beast, Beauty, Prince Charming, the Frog Prince, and Red Riding Hood. (As a side note, I personally found the resolution of the Djinn threat to be rather lame -- it is introduced as the magical equivalent of a nuclear weapon, but resolved in an anticlimactic manner in which Willingham seems to be making up new magical rules just to get himself out of a plot bind.)  The second story is about two wooden soldiers serving the Empire in a unit that is establishing a beachhead on an Arabian Fable world. We get another glimpse inside the Empire and learn more about the wooden soldiers, and these two individuals are obviously being set up as recurring characters whom we'll see in future volumes 
 This is a profound book in so many ways; here are just a few.  Augustine writes with a combination of confidence and humility that is not seen today.  His confidence stems from faith in the God he clearly knows so well and his humility from a deep understanding of the sinfulness that dwells at the very core of his being.  Worship is the purpose and attitude of the book; one can't help but be moved to do so after reading it.  This book has also stimulated me to much thought in the areas of entertainment, evangelism, conversion, and scripture.  Although this book is a great classic that has influenced Christianity and beyond for many centuries and people feel like they "should" read it, I recommend reading it for the pure delight of listening to a man who lays himself bankrupt before the Almighty and sincerely asks, "Give what you command, and command what you will. 
 I was worried that the book would be censored, but it is as I remember it.  My favorite part is when that silly little monkey gets tanked on the Ether.  Ain't medicine grand 
 Wilde, in part, attempts to portray the relativity of truth, power, and character, things we often take as absolutes, while also entertaining his audience with witty dialogue and comical mishaps 
 Dr. Wayne Dyer is wonderful.  I have been practicing meditations according to his instructions and I love it 
 This book is a very piece of literature that is relevant to today's world of globalisation against the damages [known and hiden] to the environment.  Once you read this book, you will see things in a different way and you will question more the values of the global corporate world and governments [left, right, liberal, conservatives, etc]   strongly recomend it.  enjoy 
 Packed with information and interviews never before available. Great. This book offers an entirely new perspective on the tragedy of terrorism. Chapter 2 alone is worth its purchase price, revealing just how devastating violence is to an economy and how rewarding it can be to rise to the challenge. Kudos to Carrison for an excellent read and tutelage 
 Without a doubt this book will touch the memories and hearts of everyone who pauses to slowly peruse these casual photographs of men at sea in World War II.  Without the overtones of trying to make a statement about the camaraderie that accompanies men off at war, these photographs simply follow a healthy group of sailors resting on board ship, working at their tasks, bonding in the bunk rooms and in play on the decks and the foc'sle.  There is an obvious physical relationship that is transmitted in the gentlest ways, further proof that men together find the emotional and physical support so needed in the time of isolation from the world.  It is to Evan Bachner's credit that he shares this truly sensitive body of work with the public at a time when we all need to understand not only the plight of the men away at war today, but of the common threads of pansexuality that have never been a threat but only a solace in a world infected with prejudice.  Grady Harp, December 2004  
 This album is truly mind-blowing!  I saw Regina live in concert last night (Thursday 6th July), and also was involved in a masterclass run by her on Wednesday as part of the National Youth Jazz Orchestra of Scotland Summer  course.  What an inspiration!  If you ever get the chance to see her live,  please do, because if you think the album is fabulous (which it is), you  will be truly mesmorised by her playing and the general atmosphere at one  of her gigs 
 The toy is fun for about ages 5 and up.  My little sisters got it for Christmas and one of them just turned four.  She also had a little trouble with the V meaning purple.  The pegs do fall out easily for her but the 5 year old understood that you really have to push them in.  It is educational in the sense that they can see how the letters represent the colors because that is what starts the word.  My 5 year old sister is almost reading and it was good practice for her, especially because she wanted to get out easy by just asking me and I wouldn't answer her. I wanted to buy them refills for the older one's birthday.  I work at Toys R Us and I actually found a couple refill packets, just so you know some places do have them 
 Being one of my favorite artists in the game today, i have to say that Luda is at his best with his debut album. Full of amusing lyrics and his unique rhyme style, he puts together an album with outstanding songs. Listen to hsi freestyle 'mouthing off'. He is one of the best freestylers out there. Basically if your a fan of Ludacris or southern rap then this is a must have album. 4.5/5  Top 5:  Stick 'Em Up Phat Rabbit Southern Hospitality Ho U Got A Proble 
  "Gorgeous Disaster" is a true crime book that chronicles the relationship between accused and convicted child molester Debra Lafave and Owen Lafave, her husband of less than one year.  The book gave a lot of details concerning the case and concerning Owen's marriage that have not been made public knowledge before.  Owen is a good writer and because he played a part in the story (unknowingly of course) the book is a riveting read.  The only thing that I would recommend concerning this book would be a part with pictures in the middle.  It would have been interesting seeing pictures of the Lafave wedding, and of Debra when she was younger.  
 This book is as good as anything I've read about hip hop culture in America, and how it weaves into other elements of African-American culture: basketball, feminism, the ghetto, racism, the drug wars, and more. It's extremely interesting and detailed in its close look at the way key trends in hip hop have unfolded since its founding -- the key players etc. Intelligent and thoughtful. If you are interested in contemporary music, hip hop is *the* major creative force of the last 20 years. This book is the key text. Too much writing out there is very ephemeral on this subject, about the latest hot act; this is the reference. Search Google for a longer review I wrote on postconsumer dot com with the terms "george nelson hip hop america amol sarva". I can't fit it in here 
 I've only read a few books by Heinlein, but the more of his stories I read the more I see two trends. First, he likes to take an idea, and then run with it through every possible effect and ramification it could have. Secondly, he seems to (unless I miss my guess) be writing his adventure stories from the dual perspective of himself as a youth, and himself as an older world-weary traveler (in his own eyes anyway). Reading this book I got the same feeling from Starship Troopers and Tunnel in the sky, that our protagonist is struggling to learn the essential life lessons that he will one day be in a position to hand down. But that's just Heinlein...  In this story, our master of sci-fi take the idea of freedom to it's absolute philosophical limits. First, he shows us the world of a person who is an actual slave and has no rights whatsoever. Then, he takes that individual, and shoves them into situation after situation that leave us wondering what exactly freedom is. When Thorby is taught by his adoptive father how to think, he is freed mentally. When he is adopted by space-traders he is almost totally free in a physical sense (the traders travel all of space), but he finds himself enslaved to a way of life, a series of traditions, and many many rules. As part of the intergalactic space police force (or its equivalent), he finds himself fighting for freedom, yet again a slave to the ideals and way of life (and organization) behind it. The real kicker though, is when Thorby finds himself in a position of super-powerful financial might, with literally the world at his fingertips, yet enslaved to that power and all the responsibilities that it implies.   Perhaps the real message of the story though, (to me anyway), is that freedom really is in the mind of the beholder, and helping others to overcome enslavements of a hateful, evil sort (like literal slavery) is a very good thing indeed. And no matter where you go, you will always be enslaved to something. So you'd better learn to survive, to be happy, and to make the most of what you have. And forget about the limits others try to impose upon you. A person with a mind that is free...is a Citizen of the Galaxy.  Besides all the great philosophy and ideas that Heinlein is famous for is of course a great adventure that really captures the imagination. I love every Heinlein story I've read so far, for the characters, the slick dialog (especially for it's time ), and the amazing universes he always manages to have up his sleeve. This book is DEFINITELY an enjoyable read for sci-fi fans 
 Philosphy's On A Clear Day h2o2 may seem a bit overpriced at $20 for a 1 oz. jar, but it's worth the expense. This tiny jar has a tremendous amount of applications, since only the minimal amount needed to cover the skin is enough to see results. I've had problem skin for years now. For the most part my skin is clear, but I frequently get one or two large cysts that won't go away. This cream has resolved those problems and has smoothed out my skin more in general. It also acts as a gentle moisturizer, without adding extra oil to the skin. I apply a tiny amount to my face every evening before bed, all over--and in the morning I exfoliate with St. Ives Apricot Scrub in the shower. I cannot tell you how much of a difference it has made for me. My skin glows now and is more evenly toned; this was not the case when I was just using the apricot scrub. If you try it, I hope you have the same results as me 
 My 10 year old son and I read this book and we both loved it. Three children of the elite class who have been protected all their lives venture out into the "real world" one day and the adventure starts there. They endure ALOT of hardship along the way but clearly learn something about themselves from each experience. I thought this book helped my son to question the "norms" of the world and reflect on some complex social issues like poverty and crime.   
 Please, OH Please!!! Hear Me out.  To anyone considering purchasing this album please do, this is an excellent album.  If you are a Pillows fan and have acquired their music off the web, buy this album to show your support.  I have and will buy thier other albums as they are released.  I love this band and I am major fanboy and I want The Pillows to have all the respect and success they deserve 
 There aren't words to describe this film. All other documentaries don't even stand a chance against this one. This is the one that speaks the full truth and shows it as well. It reveals the full extent of our nation's heroes' courage and bravery. As 'accidental' as this was it is the single most amazing link to the tragedy of 9/11 
 "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is a fascinating example of a film almost too "cool" for it's own good.  Stylized, somewhat self-satisfied, so pleased with it's own cleverness--this type of movie can easily rub me the wrong way!  But the odd thing is, "Kiss Kiss" walks that fine line so precariously--yet falls onto the side of good entertainment.  It's fast paced, funny and filled with good performances.  Even though the picture tries so hard, I ended up admiring that effort as opposed to being put off by it.  The ostensible plot of "Kiss Kiss" really isn't that important.  Let's just say that Robert Downey, Jr., is a small time crook masquerading as an actor masquerading as a detective.  The film works as a homage to every pulp fiction detective story you've ever read and/or seen.  Following all the necessary conventions, yet tweaking them with abundant humor, it's a twisty and fun ride.  It's not the most difficult mystery to unravel but with "Kiss Kiss," it's all about the journey.    But in addition to being a send-up of pulp detective and noir films, "Kiss Kiss" actually works as an effective satire on Hollywood as well.  It's pretty spot-on in it's depiction of the Hollywood "scene" and the community on the cusp of success.  And this, blended with the mystery, provide an absurd and magical backdrop to the story.  But the success of "Kiss Kiss" relies most heavily on it's screenplay.  One of the funniest, self-aware (but in a good way), and fastest scripts I've seen in a long time--most of the lines are delivered so quickly and in such a dead pan manner, it takes a moment to process just how witty they are.  This is an intelligent comedy for someone that appreciates cleverness, and you miss a lot of humor if you're not paying close attention.  It once again balances well--this time mainstream humor with "inside" industry jokes--so that everyone can enjoy this sly film.  Robert Downey, Jr., has a certain loose, hangdog appeal as the lead.  This is the type of material he excels at.  Val Kilmer has received a lot of attention as a gay private eye and it's a nicely controlled performance.  It's good to see him return to sophisticated entertainment.  And Michelle Monaghan also does nicely in the sexy, smart girlfriend role.  Recommended to mystery and comedy lovers, and particularly suited to film geeks and noir enthusiasts--"Kiss Kiss" works on that rare level of absurd, but intelligent, entertainment 
 The Karate Kid has been around now for over two decades.  We bought this set of four movies because we think the Karate Kid is a good role model for our 4-year old boy.  It's funny, when these movies came out, I did my best not to watch them because I was already a teenager and the Karate kid was this dorky younger teen for whom I didn't have any sympathy.  Now that I am older, I see the real value in these movies.  The boy went from being a self-absorbed "I'm so cool" dork, to learning the meaning of self-respect and dignity, while in the process earning the respect of others.  This four-movie set is definitely worth the price if you value these personal traits.  As a bonus we got to see the fourth movie which I hadn't seen before 
 This book has, under one cover, all the info we received via pamphlets and verbally over the past eleven years since diagnosis.  It is exceptionally well researched, and more importantly, is an honest sharing of the ups and downs which only a patient of Parkinson's can reveal.  A handy reference which will support the PD patient and care partner in advocating for the best treatment available 
 My son played receiver on the Briarcrest Football Team. As a fan I met Michael Oher early on. I saw Michael deal with a great amount of adversity and overcome it. I saw loving and caring individuals reach out in a way I never had seen before to help him in his quest to become educated. I also saw him enter school as a raw block of iron that through hard work, and a never give up attitude honed itself into the greatest football lineman ever to come out of the Southeast. I saw a shy individual without parents, without confidence, or economic benefit gain incredible ground, develop his education up to the level of his classmates that socially and economically had superior ability and education. This true story is a great motivational story of what an individual can overcome in life when faced with real hardship. It is also a true story of some great individuals that reached out with love and compassion for a human being in need. "BLIND SIDE" will touch your heart in a way that has never been felt before 
 Although this book targets elementary school libraries, adults of all ages and persuasions will find it riveting. Tree of Life recounts Darwin's childhood from two points of view: his own and his father's. Terrific art work of various media take readers from the naturalist's youth to his long years of travel aboard the Beagle, where his then revolutionary ideas about the origin of species took root. He knew early on that publication of his theories would create a maelstrom. The unique pictorial presentation of this material is nearly as revolutionary as Darwin's thought processes. Though chronologically linear, it feels bold and sweeping in the process of presenting so much information in so small a space. It's a spectacular, visually exciting intro to Darwin's ideas of the natural world. You feel as though you're inside the great man's brain 
 Marcia Willett is no imitator. Her writing can be compared to Pilcher and Binchy as noted, and what a wonderful compliment...i.e., the descriptive writing and attention to detail so that the characters have the breath of life in them. They wound themselves around the heart of this enchanted reader.  The descriptions of Cornwall were so clear that I was transported. The intertwining of characters, simply living their (not so) ordinary lives, becomes anything but ordinary.  The main character, Maudie Todhunter, is delightful as is her step-granddaughter Posey. Posey's Mother, Selena was impossibly frightful and Ms.Willett weaves a wonderful tale of family strengths, weaknesses, falling in love (with a few mysteries thrown in) through them.  I particularly loved Polonius, the dog. I have her "A Summer In The Country" and eagerly begin another anticipated delight! Thank you Marcia Willett! 
 Different from Cowie's first tutorial/pictorial (Colin Cowie Weddings), this book reflects more intently on all the sensational details that soar beyond simple "weddings" to absolutely luminary nuptial celebrations. Like his first book, a wealth of extraordinary photos showcasing his incredible eye for detail & distinction. An essential resource for all the bells & whistles...or just to dream 
 Talks about a lot, and in great detail without boring you. I learnd more about wines in the first 2 chapters than I did in 2 years of drinking it 
 The book really targets at non-designers, and that doesn't mean it's under par at all.  On the contrary, the book is illuminating and very easy to follow for people like me without any training in design and typography.  The author formulates four principles of design and explains them with ample examples.  The little quizzes not only reviews what we learn but also can apply the principles instantly.  The second part of the book is about typography.  The author elucidates the typography in layman's terms.  I find this book extremely useful, a good start point to explore more about design.  The author keeps asking us to explain why one design is good and why the other piece is bad, and I gradually become more aware of good design I read in everyday magazines and newspapers.  I highly recommended this book to people who are not trained but need to design posters or fliers occasionally 
 Brand's has a great style with a smart wit and feel for the times as well as anecdotal material that gives great depth to his writing 
 I've always considered the novel Friday as the start of Heinlein's `modern' science fiction works.  He wrote his novels I Will Fear No Evil (1970) and Time Enough For Love (1973) in the 70's and The Number of the Beast (1980) followed up with characters from his previous works.  Friday (1982) started out with new and fresh characters and shucked off most of the 60's and 70's feel of the other previous novels (such as the lovey-dovey talk between bedmates, the oft-used term `dear' (though still used), etc).  Although there is still some aspects of it in Friday such four lovers together in one bed.  By the 80's, swinging had pretty much ceased to be a social phenomenon.  For anyone that's a red-blooded male, you couldn't help but notice the book cover if you passed it in a book store.  On it is a pneumatic woman in a tight jump suit zippered down low.  With that though was also a problem, as the term `don't judge a book by it's cover' comes to mind and one then thinks of it as just a pulp novel and not of any good.  So come to my surprise where in this day and age where faery handbags and militant lesbianism passes as award winning SF and I look back to past science fiction works to find that Friday was one of six finalists for the 1982 Nebula Awards and one of five finalists for the 1983 Hugo Awards. It's a brilliant cover telling of the novel, the woman has her sleeves rolled up showing that she's independent and tough, and in the background is a futuristic window on what appears to be a space station or space shuttle overlooking a planet.  In one brief glimpse one's able to tell that this is a science fiction story.   Fortunately the publishers knew this book cover is a classic and have not removed it which they've unfortunately done to other classics, Frederik Pohl's Gateway being one.  It wouldn't be sufficient to say that this novel is about the adventures of Friday because although it is, it uses her actions partly as means to tell of events in the story.  North America is broken up into a series of autonomous regions and a series of assassinations and riots occur within these regions and the inner systems and asteroids.  Sort of a Tet Offensive for the Solar System.  After these events tone down for a while, she's able to meet back up with "Boss", in scenes reminiscent of Charlie's Angels.  Talking about television programs, there are strong similarities between Friday and Cameron's former program, Dark Angel.  There's a genetically modified and enhanced female courier, young and sexy, set within the future where the United States has disintegrated into several countries.    Although Heinlein does use the discrimination against genetically modified persons, or artificial persons (AP) as mentioned in the book, as an allegory on racism, racism is a bit more complex.  It's difficult to consider a male refusing a curvy, sweet, willing woman like Friday whether she's an AP, black, brown, yellow, red, Andorian blue, or Rigelian green.  And for other women to be prejudiced against Friday, it's less likely to be due to her color than to her curviness.  There's not as much sex in the novel as may have been mentioned, certainly less when compared to other Heinlein novels, I Will Fear No Evil topping the list.  Any mature adult should be able to handle the scenes within the novel.  Heinlein does rip into religion so some puritans may be offended.  As with other Heinlein novels, there are sections that drag on, and if you find yourself re-reading the same section, just plow forward, keep reading, and it'll get better.  There are some `hard-core' science fiction sections such as describing that the distances between stars may be further apart than they appear looking up into the night sky on earth.  You either already know this from astronomy or you don't really need to know it to read the novel.  Categorize this novel under `fun'!  Friday, 1982, 357 pages: 3-1/2 star

 WORKFORCE CRISIS: HOW TO BEAT THE COMING SHORTAGE OF SKILLS AND TALENT predicts a crisis in the workplace as the huge boomer generation requires and leaves less experience holding the bag in the workplace. Companies must rethink their workforce management and attract and retain works of all ages, as a result. Decades of research have culled these strategies for reorganization in WORKFORCE CRISIS, which will prove an inspirational vision for any manager looking at the long-term picture.  Diane C.

 I liked most of the songs on this CD, though its missing Solitary Man and 1 or two others I would have liked to see.  (Maybe they're outside the period the CD covers.)  The nice surprise was the liner notes, which provided interesting history into his career and depth to the songs.  Great collection 
 Just like all other Scooter albums, 'Back to the heavyweight jam' doesn't  have one bad track. All songs are great. Especially 'No Release 
 This book has some great summaries, about 6 pages in length each for a variety of businesses.  Discussions center around best-case scenarios and the author offers bits of interviews from those successful owners and how you can apply it to starting your business.  A suprisingly realistic view of quite a few different business options.  I really would like to see an updated version of this book since it was published in 2000 and the market has changed for many small businesses 
 I thought this book was very helpful. Of course, it is always easier to find jobs through your own personal and professional networks, but if you don't have that, internet searching is a good way to go. This book has many links available for jobs, internships and coops, and .... It also has job sites categorized by state and that was particularly helpful to me. Overall, I recommend this book to anybody who's looking to find a job by using the internet 
 This book is excellent.  I happened across it in Barnes & Noble and decided to get it along with Critical Care Nurse.  It brought back such fresh memories of nursing school.  The stories in here to some may sound  made up, but believe me it is the real world.  I don't think I have ever  laughed so hard while reading a book and I couldn't put it down until the  end.  You just don't understand it unless you're a nurse but all will enjoy  the laughter and heartache of hospital work.  The only thing I didn't like  was the strong language.  She could have toned it down a bit.  Otherwise, a  must read for all nurses. I look forward to reading the rest of her work 
 Having already proven himself to be one of our best biographers today, with his books on Dean Acheson, JFK, FDR, Jean Monnet, James Forrestal, Henry Ford, Rosa Parks, and others, Douglas Brinkley has done it again with a terrific look at the truth behind an American veteran, politician and lifelong public servant.    Only the ignorant and openly biased will dismiss this highly-detailed examination of John Kerry's war experience, from growing up in Denver and his education at Yale through to his trials, triumphs, and ultimate disgust with the Vietnam War.  Any questions you have about Kerry's character or his military service - especially those invented by political opponents who instead backed a corrupt coward named W - you'll find the answers right here.  If you value truth over hype and courage over self-serving cronyism, you'll enjoy this book 
 George Washington being the "Father of our country" has new meaning for me.  
 Sometimes more is just more; in this collection, that is not the case.  Stan Lee and Jack Kirby continue to improve in skill and art as they tell marvel-lous tales about space, time, genetics, and science fiction.  Plus, it contains Jack Kirby's "This is a Plot?," which is a comical depiction of he and Stan at work, and a Fantastic Four Feature Fantasy starring the Silver Surfer!  A must for any F.F. fan! 
 My husband designs roller coasters, and I wanted to get a book for our son who, someday, is going to be riding them!  (He's 7 weeks old today :)  This is a great book for kids who may be a little scared of roller coasters, and who need to know exactly what happens from waiting in line to getting back in line after the ride is over!  Easy read and great pictures 
 Absolutely fabulous book.  I love picking up this book and reading it. It is inspiring and elating and I would recommend it to everyone on a "destiny" tour 
 Just listen to the song "Mister Trouble" off of the Folkway Recordings CD and that will say it all my friends !!! What a song, what a song, what a song !! 
 The aniversary edition is totally cool. It contains some helpful drawings. Excellent size font 
 Crescent  This is the story of Sirine, half Iraqi-half American, who works in a Lebanese Cafe in Los Angeles. Still single at 40, Sirine lives with her uncle, enjoys her fullfilling work as a Chef, and is the centre of attraction for men coming to the cafes, attracted by her middle eastern dishes which remind them of home and her mysterious ways. In a setting of homesickness, love for a lost country and longing for the middle east, Abu Jaber weaves a slow tale of love, woes and food. Sirine meets mysterious Han, Aziz and Nathan, all haunted in some way or another by Iraq and Sirine. This is quite a slow story which I thought could have benefited from deeper character development, especially for Sirine, but the whole Middle Eastern setting I thought was beautifully recreated. This is a great book for anyone interested especially in Iraqi culture 
 I am 21 years old, and still remember being handed this book before going to the hospital when I was quite young. I remember feeling more comfortable with all of the things I would see, and feeling safer knowing that Grover did not have a scary time :) I would absolutely recommend this book to parents of children who will be having a hospital stay 
 If you don't understand drinking, you don't understand  American history. Colonial Americans drank like fish   average whiskey consumption one pint daily. In the early   1800s they went on a bigger binge, mostly on hard liquor and   drinking alone, rather than sociably like in the old days.   Rorabaugh says this explains how the temperance movement   came up just then, & it was the stress of industrialization &  frontier loneliness & inflated dreams for the new nation.   Readable & smart & has the good modern historical perspective   on ³alcoholism² but¹s still skeptical of heavy intoxicant use 
 I've read a lot of books that talk about Sun Tzu's strategies in the Art of War and I have to say that most of them are junk. I picked up this book and expected the same thing-lots of Eastern mumbo-jumbo and not a whole lot of content, especially since this book opens up with a Zen story.     I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this is actually quite a good read. I was 1/3 of the way through it before I realized that this was a pretty good strategy book. The book is disarming because it presents all the case studies as stories. Every story is an engaging read - kind of like a novel - so I didn't expect real content. But it's there. For instance, when it comes to vision, which is a topic that's been overdone in every book, the authors list five key points that, while they are common sense, really make it easy to get the feel for what a good vision should be:     1) Celebrate successes because celebrations acknowledge the vision being followed and lived on a daily basis  2) Go back to the beginning (meaning you should always revisit the initial spark or reason for the business being started-this mostly applies to companies where the founders are no longer present)  3) Dignity because unless the vision makes everyone associated with the organization more human and dignified it's not worth the time  4) Hire to fit the vision because trying to cram someone with all the right skills and all the wrong attitudes into a corporate vision is a failed experiment  5) Cultivate culture because it doesn't happen by itself (the authors profile exactly how some of the top companies do this)     None of this is rocket science, but the point of the book is that business shouldn't be rocket science either. If the strategy is sound then the business should be sound as well. This book is more like on-the-job training for strategy than a comprehensive strategy manual. The stories give you a taste of what good strategy is and how it should look and feel, but it's definitely not a beginner's guide. Overall an entertaining read and an insightful glimpse into what really goes on behind closed doors in some of the world's best companies. A for entertainment, B+ for actual strategy content 
 I liked it, it was an interesting version. I never thought that I'd see Kate Beckingsale playing Alice. It was funny how her hair kept changing with like every scene 
 Paul Johnson's highly readable case study of Finney-inspired revivals in Rochester argues that these revivals were a response to the breakdown of social relationships involving work.  His research finds that the revivals  converted the relatively stable entrepreneurial class of Rochester who had  recently abandoned former traditional employer-employee relationships where  the employee boarded within the home of the employer.  The revival  legitimized this abandonment (and the resulting free labor system) by  emphasizing the individual's moral freedom.  Furthermore, the revival  united the entrepreneurial class behind a mission-oriented Protestantism  that enabled them to assert economic pressure, and a measure of social  control, over the working class.  While clearly sympathetic to the working  class perspective, Johnson does not create a Protestant hegemonic  conspiracy where none existed.  Although one may dissent from his  fundamental assumptions and approach, Johnson's argument is quite effective  within the framework he has set for himself.  I recommend this work to  students of religion and society and antebellum reform 
 The clue's in the title.   "Clarity" is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is so clear and well written.  It opens the heart to the possibilities of inner peace and contentment.  Just what everyone in this world needs.  It should be in every school and library.  Well worth finding out about 
 This is a WOW book. It first analysis the way we think & then step by step it explains the changes that we need to incorporate. My Favourate chapters are Casual flow chart & matrix. 
 I  love Ben Nye Make up. It is originally Stage make up. But now can be used for every day. The color lasts long and is very impressive. 
 I saw this film when it was first released in the late '80's. To this day I think it is the most moving piece of art I have ever seen. It gave me a new persective.  I was shocked to find that there were some unhappy reviews of this film on this site. I think that might derive from the fact that many facets of this film have since been copied by other directors and screen writers, so todays new viewers may not get the opportunity to see this film as the ground-breaking piece of art that it is.   But even with that said, ignore the negative reviews and just see this beautiful movie set in the divided/cold war era Berlin.  My best to all of you 
 At first view the book seems like a dissapointment. Numerous equations, most of them rather complex. You feel that this is basically an academic book and has nothing to do with real and practical knowledge. But as you go deeper into the book you will soon realize that the content is going to be very helpful in a practical point of view.  The book starts with pure vibration theory. Don't even think that this is sonething to ignore as it is so important to know the basic aspects of vibraton theory in order to go deep in damper knowledge. You will find many important and interesting things for the real world, like transmissibility of the suspension, damping coefficient, damping ratio, damping factor and more. Also at Section 2.8 series stiffness is being discussed which is an extremely interesting subject in a practical point of view. Chapter 3 is maybe the most important chapter of the book describing in depth the theoryof vehicle vibrations, ride, handling and most importantly you will learn a lot about ride handling compromise.  Chapter 4 is about motion ratio, its effect in suspension behavior and also you will be so happy to be in a position to understand the basic differences in terms of geometry and behavior between double wishbones, mcpherson struts, rocker arm suspension, pushrod, pullrod and motorcycle forks and rear suspensions. Personally, i was excited to find out that in most cases there are not huge differences in behavior between a double wishbone and a strut suspension. Chapter 5 is all about fluid dynamics but as the author also states, you must already have a level of knowledge on the topic in order to fully understand the stuff there. Chapter 6 is about valve design, valve types, velve characteristics and valve models. Chapter 7 will guide you through the damper behavior, it will talk about valve flow rates and the effect of these on damper behavior, damper parameters like damper symmetry and more. Chapter 8 discusses about the adjustable dampers and the effects of the various adjustments in the damper behavior. Chapter 9 will give you a guide on how to specify a damper Chapter 10 is a very nice and practical chapter on damper testing.   If i have a single complaint about this book is that it would be 100% perfect in the case it contained some colour real pictures of various types of dampers, damper internal components, various types of valves, etc.   All in all, this is a book you cannot afford to lose if you are serious in dampers. I would like to see a more modern new edition though 
 I bought this book a few weeks ago, and was very touched by it. I live in San Diego and just this week this book was featured in the Reader. I am so glad! This book is what I will be recommending to anyone who asks. Thank you for this wonderful read 
 Anne Bronte constructs a vivid Victorian world in AGNES GREY, which isn't surprising since it's drawn so strongly on her own experiences.    Agnes is a dutiful clergyman's daughter who goes into the world to seek employment as a governess in order to contribute to her family's financial well-being.  Her several positions are described with deadly accuracy--the bratty children, the yapping dogs, the secretly disdainful other servants, the uninvolved parents.  All are rendered here in minute and telling detail.    Agnes's familial background--and the familial background of Anne Bronte, of course--makes her especially well-suited to describing a local cleric she dislikes: "His favourite subjects were church discipline, rites and ceremonies, apostolical succession, the duty of reverence and obedience to the clergy, the atrocious criminality of dissent, the absolute necessity of observing all the forms of godliness, the reprehensible presumption of individuals who attempted to think for themselves in matters connected with religion, or to be guided by their own interpretations of Scripture, and occasionally (to please his wealthy parishioners), the necessity of deferential obedience from the poor to the rich--supporting his maxims and exhortations throughout with quotations from the Fathers . . . But now and then he gave us a sermon of a different order--what some would call a very good one; but sunless and severe: representing the Deity as a terrible taskmaster, rather than a benevolent father . . . [on leaving the church, I heard] his voice in jocund colloquy with some of the Melthams or Greens, or, perhaps, the Murrays themselves; probably laughing at his own sermon, and hoping that he had given the rascally people something to think about; perchance, exulting in the thought that old Betty Holmes would now lay aside the sinful indulgence of her pipe, which had been her daily solace for upwards of  thirty years; the George Higgins would be frightened out of his Sabbath evening walks, and Thomas Jackson would be sorely troubled in his conscience, and shaken in his sure and certain hope of a joyful resurrection at the last day."  Bronte displays this same calm, measured, extraordinarily accurate descriptive skill throughout the novel, which more than makes up for the fact that the plot is simple and the action mostly calm and uneventful.  The joys of the book lie chiefly in seeing how Bronte renders even the simplest character vividly lifelike 
 This is a terrific cd for many reasons;  1) The songs are top notch. This is a perfect power pop album. The songs are laden with irresistable hooks, hummable melodies, will make you bounce up and down and really rock.  2) The production is great. It is really sparce with lots of room and space around the instruments. You will hear the snares vibrating, bass thumping and each string on the guitar twanging.  3) The musicianship is great. These are no Yes/Led Zeppelin compositions but the bass is way up front and often acting as the melody or counter melody to what the guitar is doing. The drumming is very explosive and each chord and note truly counts. It is similar to the energy and dynamics of Elvis Costello and the Attractions.  Many metal,punk, jazz artists etc have done covers of these wonderful songs. The album has all great songs, with varying paces yet rocking just as hard as anything out there.  "Is she really going out with him", "Sunday papers", "Got the time", "fools in love", "happy loving couples" and "baby stick around" are standouts however there is no filler and the cd blazes away at a quick pace.   This is a high energy, fast paced cd. When it first came out it did not get the full accolades that it deserved. Joe Jackson was a serious, diversified artist and tried different forms of music but I think he came out of the gates with this, his hardest rocking, most fluid record.   I am not a Joe Jackson fan. "I'm the Man" is okay and the rest of his stuff does nothing for me. I am not a Joe Jackson fan raving about anything he does. It is just this particluar cd is really, really good and deserves attention.  I cannot say enough praise for this and I appreciate it more as it ages. It has withstood the test of time and is a certifiable classic. You can get this cd used for probably less than $8 delivered and therefore owning this is a no brainer.  
 Brad Snyder has done it again. Following on the heels of his much-acclaimed Beyond The Shadow of the Senators, Snyder returns to the pinnacle of his profession with A Well-Paid Slave, a gripping account of Curt Flood's fight for free agency in professional sports. In my opinion, Snyder's latest work is at once the best baseball book and the best law book that I've read in years. It is a gem that shows off Snyder's talents as a writer, researcher, and legal analyst.     On Oct. 7, 1969, Flood, an All-Star and Gold Glove centerfielder with the St. Louis Cardinals, was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. Instead of accepting the trade, Flood challenged the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams for life, and brought a lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court.  Although he narrowly lost before the Court, Flood paved the way for free agency and helped give ballplayers some say in where they played. The free agents who will sign multimillion dollar contracts this off-season owe some of their good fortune to Flood.  According to Snyder, Jackie Robinson started a racial revolution by putting on a uniform and Flood started an economic revolution by taking his uniform off.    In one riveting volume, Snyder manages both to tell Flood's personal and professional story and to present in a manner that is comprehensible even to those without formal legal training the amazing story of Flood's case, from the trial level all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as its implications forty years later.   In a lengthy review this past Sunday, the New York Times Book Review concluded:  "Generations of ballplayers -- Curt Flood's children -- have never honored him properly. But with his fine book, Brad Snyder surely has." I could not have said it better myself. Snyder is a star. A must read for anyone interested in baseball, American history, law, and sociology.  
 I can't vouch for her recipes but I can speak for her prose.  I picked up this book for pure entertainment and found it.  Fisher's conversation is elegant, entertaining, and educational, and her advice is at times amusing, at times timeless 
 This deceptively slim volume, while an easy read, is so densely packed as to be nearly impossible to digest in a single reading.  Ridley expertly illustrates fundamental concepts in a warm, humor-rich voice that in no way resembles the dusty monotone of the average classroom text.  I plan to re-read it many times over 
 This book is captivating even for non-"history buffs".  I was so impressed by it that I ordered copies for several family members and friends and they rave about it.  If the history books used in schools were even half this interesting we'd be a nation of history scholars.  Having those who lived through it "tell" you what happened and how in such detail makes it a hard book to put down.  It's the best 12 bucks you'll ever spend 
 I own the 1995 edition of this book & thought this 2006 edition was to be an expanded version. No, it's alike, page by page, with only an additional index entry for zucchini muffins. However, my old edition was falling apart and I am quite glad to have this reprint from a different publishing company anyway!   On Brownie Mix: Yes, it has no shortening. Hurray, no trans fats! I add for the additional ingredients: 1/8 c. melted butter or Smart Balance, 1/8 c. applesauce, 1/2 c. egg substitute, 1 t. vanilla, 2 1/4 c. Brownie Mix.  No nuts, because my husband doesn't like them in food, but I often add 1/4 c. mini chocolate chips. My brownie mix is half all purpose flour, half King Arthur Flour White Wheat flour.  We like fudgey brownies, not cake style 
 These are heady days for anime and manga as they occupy the mainstream spotlight. Japanophilia is on the rise. But how could a very singular culture (anime and manga riding the cultural tsunami wave) explode into an American phenomenon? Even the Japanese seem to be dumb founded.   Roland Kelts topical book _Japanamerica_ provides that answer. Clocking in at 223 pages (HC) it's a cultural treatise on steroids. _Japanamerica_ provides an intimate insider's look and overturns some long held myths. Highly recommended for the otaku and non-otaku alike.   Being a huge fan of anime, manga and all things Japanese for a long time, I loved this book!  A bibliography for the curious would have been useful.  Here's hoping for a sequel on the "world-wide" effects of Japanese pop culture.     
 Laura Rankin's The Handmade Alphabet portrays the letters of the alphabet along with their manual alphabet counterparts in American Sign Language.  Each letter receives one page on which the uppercase letter appears in a black, serif font in the upper-left corner of the page and is accompanied by a realistic illustration of a hand demonstrating the manual alphabet of American Sign Language as well as an object cleverly representing the letter.  "G" is demonstrated by a gloved hand; "K" is demonstrated by a baby's hand holding a key ring; "X" shows an x-ray of the hand demonstrating the sign.  The illustrations of the hands are done in softly luminous colored pencil on charcoal paper, with exquisite detail.  The hands are of different races, sexes, and ages.  This book focuses solely on letters, but does offer a key that lists the words for the objects portrayed with each letter.  Of course this book will be useful for deaf children or children with deaf parents or friends who are learning the alphabet, but may be useful for other children as well to drive home the concept of abstract symbol systems and the different ways sounds and meaning can be represented. 
 David Freeland's Ladies Of Soul profiles the rise and fall of seven female performers of the 1960s. Maxine Brown, Ruby Johnson, Carla Thomas, Timi Yuro and others are revealed, from their struggles for success to issues involved in their music. A very different, unusual account 
 I mailed this for a shower gift so I didn't see the item but was told it was very cute 
 This was an excellent read. The story grabs you from the very beginning and is filled with many exciting and unexpected twist!!!! I finished this book in 3 days! Buy it you won't regret it. 
 I love this watch it is beautiful. I am a fan of dragonflies and this watch has them and how. You can have them "fly" in the background or stay still by the press of a button. 
 I found out about the Plimsouls by watching Valley Girl. I really liked "A Million Miles Away" and the other songs featured in the movie, so I decided to buy the soundtrack. I just happened to come across this CD for $5.99 on Amazon and couldn't pass it up, even though I was planning to buy it anyway. I like all of the songs on this CD. I definitely recommend this CD whether you already like the Plimsouls or are just discovering them 
 No author can make every book work. It's unfair to expect that. This is the first Ondaajate book I read, make that: devoured. I loved the non-linearity, the depth of love for his home country, the characters gathering and separating. I write this review because I believe strongly that Anil's Ghost is the companion piece to "Running in the Family" and less well-done, less artful. But this book more than makes up for the flaws in the later book. Perhaps the kleig lights of fame are too hot for a writer to work at his best. I say that because the author of this book is so gifted and has so much to evoke that I expect he will do so again, maybe not in his beloved, insane Sri Lanka, or maybe back there again. So, in closing, If you despaired of loving "Anil's Ghost" read this and you're efforts will be fully redeemed 
 The works of Winslow Homer are already well familiar to any interested in American art: they captured the American Civil War and, later, scenes of early America as a whole, presenting a range of styles and themes - so it's surprising to note this book is the first in-depth critical survey written in the last decade. Here all his major paintings appear along with a number of etchings and woodcuts to compliment a blend of biography and critical art survey. Full-page color prints not only analyze the works; they offer insights into the public's reaction to scenes, settings, and perspectives. A powerful, recommended pick.  Diane C.

 I most like her very short stories & this is a great collection. They are almost scenes more than stories. In many of her writings, definitely in my favorites ("But the One on the Right"- about sitting next to a dud at a dinner party, "The Sexes"- about a date getting off on the wrong foot, "Here We Are"- about nervous newlyweds), Parker takes  people's silent assumptions, adds dialogue riddled with miscommunication, then has her characters completely overanalyze the situation. What's left is very biting, very funny and gives loads of evidence to the saying  that `assuming makes an ass out of you and me' 
 If you like historical fiction, you will definitely like this book. I was so fascinated with the historical context, I researched it further and found the book very accurate in its details of a little-known "society" that existed pre-Civil War. You can Google New Orleans People of Color to find historical information. I have not read Anne Rice, since I'm not interested in her usual topics, so am not familiar with her writing style, however, she kept my attention with this book. I couldn't put it down. I read a lot, and it is one of my all-time favorite books.  I rented the movie, which was a disappointment, as usual, but it gave me a visual impression of the characters and places. 
 There are few actors who could deliver such a performance as Patrick Stewart. His recital of A Christmas Carol is by far the best avaliable. The story's tone and Dickens' characters are truly brought to life through Stewart. Highly recommended for the holidays, the classroom, or for any fan of this classic 
 I love this film! It really does justice to Stephen King's novel (which I just Finished recently). I say that this is better than the book because it is alot less bloodier. The story works alot better without most of the gore. I still would have liked to seen the scene when Annie uses a lawnmower to kill a young policeman. I would not have laughed at it. It would have been nice to have it included as an extra 
 If you are looking for "management" book that recycles the organization scripts that appear in many other books, look elsewhere.  Mr. Koch's book successfully links the performance of the individual employee, the company, and societies progress in the battle for more freedom and less control.  This is a novel connection.  While all of the Market-Based Management dimensions are worth study, decision rights and incentives are two that really struck home.  Giving employees the freedom to make decisions is earned by good performance.  Employee performance is what decides compensation.  Many others preach this, but Koch Industries has proved it.  Incentives must be aligned by the manager to match up: What is good for me (employee)?, What is good for the company/organization?, and What is good for society?  This is a difficult task and requires critical thinking, but crucial and often overlooked.  This book works for those in the private sector as well as the non-profit world.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a fresh take on management.     
 Easy to follow, this book is a good place to start learning about growing and using herbs. In addition to clear explanations on making tinctures, poultices, teas, baths, etc. there are recipes and suggestions for seasonal celebrations.  The fact that it covers not only medicinal uses but also culinary and gift making makes it a valuable beginners book on the diverse uses of herbs.  As a green witch,  I liked the chance to learn about herbs commonly used in magick from a different perspective.  It gave me ideas on how to use these gifts from the Earth in a way that still represents my beliefs yet allows me to share it them with others in different forms other than incense or potions 
 I read this book as part of an effort to catch my breath during Spring Break in my first semester teaching a large college class. It left me feeling re-energized and excited about the new ideas I learned, and gave me new perspective on the whole undertaking. It is chock full of really useful and thought-provoking insights and suggestions. Reading the book basically got me ready to get back to teaching with renewed enthusiasm and confidence.  I would recommend this enjoyable and extremely useful book to any college teacher looking for new ideas and techniques--even a fresh attitude toward how they approach the classroom and their students. 
 Is the enemy of my enemy my friend?  That seems to be the central question in The Keep:  when some dark supernatural force starts picking off Nazis, does that automatically make it benevolent?  The pursuit of the answer makes this book a good, effective horror story.  The Keep is a small structure in the Transylvanian Alps.  In 1941, the Germans realize it is strategically located and some soldiers are sent to occupy it, led by Captain Woermann.  Woermann is an old-school soldier and generally not a bad guy; he hates Nazis, but believes the army will outlast the Hitler regime.  He is also leery of the Keep; it is too well-maintained, there are all sorts of crosses on the walls and there are no birds anywhere near it.  A couple of his soldiers try to loot a cellar and instead wind up unleashing some dark force that begins killing around one soldier a night.  Woermann wants to leave the Keep but is ordered to stay.  Instead, he gets "relief" from some SS troops, led by the vile bully, Major Kaempffer.  Kaempffer, despite his boasting, can do nothing and soon his people are dying as well.  A little research, however, leads Kaempffer to grab Jewish historian Theodor Cuza and his daughter Magda in an attempt to find answers.  Meanwhile, a mysterious red-haired man crosses Europe heading towards the Keep.  Cuza does appear to provide some help, finding out the creature's name is Molasar and that he hates Germans.  This appears to make the pair allies, as Cuza knows exactly what the Nazis are capable of.  But what is Molasar?  And what is his agenda?  Therein lies the mysteries that make this such a good book.  In fact, this is top-notch horror, marred only by a final chapter that saps some of the energy out of the book.  But I am willing to dismiss those last few pages (they don't really upend the plot) and focus on the rest of the book, which takes traditional elements of horror and adds enough twists to make this a good, original work. 
 My three-year-old nephew already knew his numbers. He loves watching this video---picks it over Dora and others.  He can now add all the single-digit numbers and some double digits.  He has some blocks that look like the quidgets in this video and that helps reinforce the concepts when he isn't watching.  He loves to stack them up, starting with, say, 2 blocks and 4 blocks, and putting them together to make !!6 blocks!! He gets so excited 
 I read this book sometime around 1975 when it first surfaced as a highly literate diary chronicling the Rolling Stones 1972 tour of America.Basking in the reflected glory of the (then and arguably still)'greatest rock n' roll band in the world';the author is afforded access all areas,and guides the reader from bickering rehearsal sessions,through rigid security meetings and late flights,until finally you are granted a carte blanche  ticket for the greatest show on earth.Greenfield's cultured and informative reporting hurls you head-first into the crazed and ruthless world of the maelstrom that is The Rolling Stones in all their sometimes heavy-handed glory.Wonderfully entertaining stories unfold throughout this incredible journey as the outlaws in love march like kings,across the decadent sprawling lawns of mighty America.Pure zeitgeist.Great stuff. After reading this book you just wanna'play 'Exile on Main St.' at serious volume and wish that you never had to go to work again.(Oh'well.. 
 This book lists fabulous ideas and how to fix some of life's everyday problems.  From removing toilet bowl rings, to fixing facial blemishes, keeping pets off furniture, and even stopping hiccups!  Listed in the back  are great recipes that use lemons.   This book is well organized & it  even gives a brief "history" on the lemon.  Highly recommended 
 This movie is fantastic.  It should be mandatory on everyones dvd list.  It's so funny and fun and it stars two of the best from the 80's brat pack - Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. Molly Ringwalds character, Samantha, is about to turn 16 just at the exact same time her older sister is about to get married.  In all the commotion, her birthday is forgotten and ruined.  Her grandparents (so cute) come to stay at their house and bring along a hilarious Asian exchange student with them.  She is forced to go along to the school dance (and take the exchange student with her) and there at the dance, Anthony Michael Hall (king of the nerds) has a wager with his nerd friends (including a very young John Cusack) that he can get her pants by the end of the night and will show them to all the nerds in the bathroom.  There is actually a very tender scene in a car at the 'car workshop' classroom where he and Sam have a bit of a heart to heart.  She reveals her secret crush (Jake - the hottest guy in school).  One thing leads to another and the rest of the movie is spent with the 'will they, won't they get together'.   With a predictable ending (albeit happy and fun), this is a great movie that I never get tired of.  Long Duc Dong (the exchange student) steals every scene he is in.  He is so funny (fans of ER got to see him again as he had a minor role each week for a long while back).  This is a cool movie that I highly recommend because it's absolutely great and to me, it will always be a classic 
 	I though that this was a book that was definitely worth reading. It was a little confusing at certain parts but overall it was fairly straight forward.  	I got a little confused when it was supposed to be Hillary but she was still talked as if she was Chana. I liked the overall point of the book and I thought then ending was pretty good. I feel like the ending maybe could have been dragged out a little more then it was.  	I liked the detail that is in the book when Chana is in the concentration camp. It is not to brutal but it gets the point across pretty well. I liked at the end how Chana was in the bed next to Hillary in the hospital. I also liked how you find out at the end that Chana ended up finding her sister and then she left the photo album of her family for Hillary.  
 We purchased this book for our son who was not sure if he wanted to quit smoking. The book sat on a shelf for a month. Then he picked it up and began to read. One evening he came into our bedroom and said he had finished the book. We asked him if you had quit smoking, and he said "Yes!" He hasn't smoked since. This book is an incredibly persuasive tool for smoking cessation. Maybe it is due to the author's departure from standard scare tactics, his own intimate acquaintance with cigarette addiction, and his unorthodox methods, such as telling the reader to continue to smoke while reading the book. We have purchsed two more copies for friends. If you have tried to quit unsuccessfully or have been hesitant to try at all, this could be the book for you. 
 I rented this movie thinking that it would be pretty stupid.  Man, was I suprised.  I laughed so hard for 90 minutes, it took another 90 to catch my breath.  I went out and bought this movie the very next day and have watched probably too many times but it hasn't lost a thing.  In a time where everyone is worried about being P.C., it's nice to see a truely funny movie.  I am sure not everyone will like this but if you enjoy goofy slapstick type comedy, I would HIGHLY suggest this movie 
 This is an excellent book for the person who knows nothing about Siamese Fighting Fish.  It gives a good general knowledge.  The pictures were excellent also. It left me wanting to know more 
 This is one of the better field guides available for identifying and determining the usefulness of many medicinal plants found commonly in the Eastern and Central US.  This guide is recommended for beginners and experienced medicinal plant enthusiasts alike.  A must have book for the novice in this field 
 I think the author brought this very interesting era vividly to life. So vivid, in fact, that Brenda's and the other druids' travails were very upsetting to me! I loved the details and description, and didn't want the book to end 
   My dad, uncle and aunt were born in the Zone. I came to this book with a lot of interest due to  family involvement. The story is absorbing. The history of the French attempt in the 1880's is  largely lost to our knowledge of Canal history.    The U.S.'s political, [military action to gain posession of the Panama Teritory from Colombia], and the financial chicanery to finance the construction  is enlightening. Teddy Roosevelt's personality, drive and ambition were to a great degree responsible for getting the project completed.   Obstacles such as recruiting labor, construction in the jungle environment with  yellow fever rampaging, overcoming incredible  management and engineering problems, and the politcal obstacles, keep your interest s as though it were a novel of unknown outcome.  The resolution of the Yellow  Fever issue is a story in itself.      
 This is a very warm and nice jacket. That looks cool too. If you want anything to keep you warm for winters this is it. Value for money and I loved it.  the only thing I found discerning was that it is a bit heavier than expected. Keep it in mind while buying. Also an all metal zipper would have been nicer than a plastic one. But I found it perfect for me 
 Armchair Theatre appeared during a lull in the music world, (which in Cincinnati could mean any day,) and as a result, it got absolutely zilch as far as airplay.  It deserved better.  Jeff Lynne's collection of friends alone should have earned some airplay, but the fact of the matter is, very few people know who Jeff Lynne is.  ELO aside, he was never quite a household name, but he demonstrates his uncanny ability to bend and shape even the distinctive guitar of George Harrison into his signature sound.  Far and away, the best cuts on here are "Every Little Thing" and "Blown Away", but there is nothing that isn't at least listenable on this album.  OOP or not, this is a pretty decent effort, guaranteed not to offend anyone within listening distance. Happy Birthday, Mom 
 This movie is, I believe, essentially a metaphor for the relations between men and women in japan, and perhaps elsewhere. I'm undecided as of now whether or not this movie has universal meaning or if its intrinsically tied to Japanese culture...  The plot is simple, an aging widower in a decent career position is talked into holding "auditions" for a potential new wife. The women are selected from those already auditioning for a movie part, creating a cover for the widower to sit in and judge the women by his own standards. One catches his eye, and at first glance, she's the parfect caricature of the submissive japanese female ideal. She is, to say the least, a wolf in sheep's clothing...   The men in the film spend time lamenting the decline of the traditional japanese woman, an event they blame for the "lonliess" they see haunting japan. They arn't presented as chauvanists, but as decent men geniunely concerned about their futures in a society where their values are increasingly threatened. So what is Miike saying? Underneath the ideal woman is a wounded and angry sadist, the ideal is false. So is there hope for japan? Have men been too cruel towards the traditional women, leaving only the "classless, stuck up, snobs"? Should these women resume traditional roles, or is it men who must change to be more accepting of the new woman? Miike doesn't seem to take a side, only present an ironic and dark vision that will surely be with you long after you watch it... 
 Great book for one who wants to learn about Hinduism and the feminine within the Indian traditions. Scholarship is excellent, but it isn't for those who have more New Age beliefs in general on goddeses such as Kali or Hindu/eastern concepts in general. I would suggest it for those who are actually into learning about the Hindu religion and not the Western idea of Indian culture and religion 
 This box set seeks to recapture the magic of the first motown box set and while it delivers great music, it doesn't quite live up to its predecesor. The first box defined a time. Motown was called "the sound of young america" and that can be heard in the music. Joyful, questioning, urgent, fun, pleading. That was the 60's and that was the first box set. The second set suffers from the fact that Motown was not as big a music force in the 70's. The music does not have the vitality of the earlier decade. That being said, it does contain some marvelous music. The first 2 discs especially. Motown lives on in this box, just not as robustly as it did in the earlier one. I would recommend it, but I don't think it will occupy as much of your time as the first box set. It's note worthy for some of the one hit wonders that were included (like berry Gordy's own son who went under the moniker "rockwell"). Fun but not memorable collection 
 Kim Corrum, yet another woman unabashed in her natural submissive desires, showcases the inner workdings of a maledom relation and the breaking of the girl to free the inner sweet little submissive slut that lies inside.  Bearking of the Girl: Let the first lesson commence.  
 It's not frequent that one is able to find books that are so relevant to personal current endeavours. In the case of solo freelos like many of the ISVs are, the personal an professional boundaries are often blurred. This is a superb book full of hints, guidance and resources that will enrich your path to building a successful solo practice. Of course, it does not have a fail-safe formula or guaranteed approach. But it is a book that deals with all those uncharted waters you might have to face

 _A Suitable Boy_ starts with a wedding and concludes with a wedding.  Mrs. Rupa Mehra wants to choose a suitable marriage partner for her younger daughter, Lata.  He would have to be acceptable to Lata's mother, to the family, and most of all he would have to be a man whom Mrs. Rupa Mehra's late husband would have been proud.  Lata rebels, but must eventually navigate through a Muslim student, a poet, and a shoe manufacturer.  The theme of Hindu versus Muslim not only figures prominently in finding Lata a suitable boy, but also is salient in relation to friendships, jealous love affairs, politics, and even a section of the novel concerning a Muslim man saving the life of a Hindu boy during a horrific stampede that occurs in the midst of an Indian religious festival.    Seth has done a wonderful job in developing his characters.  They are by turns flawed, tender, selfish, neurotic and always very human.  One of the major male characters in the book, even when he is facing possible attempted murder charges, still evokes my sympathy.  The author makes many forays into the minutia of Indian politics during the early 1950s.  I must admit that my eyes would often start to close at these points in the novel.  This made reading this 1500 page book all the more difficult.  The recurring story element related to confiscating land from wealthy landlords, though, is especially interesting, considering that India, at that time, was a newly independent, emerging democracy, having to ponder such important issues as the fair distribution of wealth.  All in all, Seth has written a warm hearted, sensitive book, in which the past 6 months of my life has been enrichened 
 I've never read the entire book (I'm working on it!) but just excerpts from my eighth grade lit. book, but what I've seen of it is FUNNY! Cornelia Skinner and Emily Kimbrough get into such hilarious circumstances! This is one of the few books I've laughed aloud with 
 I got this for my brother.  He says it's a 5.  
 This book taught a life lesson. When bad happens, there are good people willing to help make things better. This was a good book. I am taking English 324 Literature for Children with Professor Roger D. Samples, he is a wonderful teacher. 
 This is the first scanner i have ever owned, and I must say its a good scanner. I bought it to listen to railroad communications mainly. I do listen to local police dept's (3 of them) and they all come in clear. I would say its a great scanner and the programming is not THAT hard, but it does take a little getting used to. Also, the antenna that comes with it can prove a little useless everyonce in a while, but i think thats with most of the scanners. So, if you buy a good antenna for this thing, it will work GREAT. 
 This book is right on the money.  We stayed in the Clearwater Beach area while vacationing in Florida, and used this book to find a place to stay at Clearwater Beach that is dog friendly.  Also, the book listed dog beaches and dog friendly cafes.  The dog beaches were so much fun for both us and the dog.  The book also gave some great tips about taking dogs in Florida, like alligators and salt water, which us Northerners didn't really think about.  A great book, would reccommend it to anyone traveling to Florida 
 All the music on this CD took me back to the 1970s and early 1980s. Great CD to listen! 
 In 1733 Benjamin Franklin released the first Poor Richard's Almanac. He was by no means famous when it appeared. Another twenty years would pass before his electrical experiments brought him worldwide attention. But some Philadelphians knew Franklin as a dedicated printer and public servant. Regardless, Franklin needed a  marketing gimmick to gain a percentage of the crowded almanac market. This bold trick involved his main competitor, Titan Leeds. On the inside cover Franklin (writing as "Richard Saunders" or "Poor Richard") predicted Leed's death in October of that same year. It worked. The "scandal" spread throughout Philadelphia and sales of "Poor Richard's Almanack" skyrocketed. Leeds did not die, of course, as predicted but Franklin (Saunders) hilariously stood his ground in future issues.  This very slim volume, reproduced to scale, also contains some of Franklin's best known sayings. "Eat to live, and not live to eat" lies buried in the grid for the month of May. Dozens more phrases peek out from the text, including "He's a Fool that makes his Doctor his Heir", "Hunger never saw bad bread", "Beware of meat twice boil'd & an old foe reconcil'd", "He that lies down with dogs, shall rise up with fleas". Of course Franklin didn't pen many of these phrases, but he cleverly aligned them for his own purpose.  A lot of history sits in these fourteen pages. Vestiges of astronomy and 18th century thought fill up each page. This almanac served many purposes. Its pages list the year's eclipses, court schedules, Quaker meetings, planetary motions, and "A Chronology of Things Remarkable". Another page lists the distance between towns. Franklin also included a list of kings (listing Saunders as "an American Prince, without Subjects, his Wife being Viceroy over him"). Entertainment was also on the menu.  With this volume Franklin's true fame begins. Though Poor Richard didn't outsell all other almanacs at the time, it maintained a special status with its audience. Franklin retired Saunders in 1758. He had quit the printing business years before and, thanks to his illustrious reputation, dragged into politics. As Poor Richard faded Franklin entered the world stage. His life then followed the progression of the American Revolution.  This small pamphlet demonstrates Franklin's timelessness. His publicity stunts and pithy sayings still resonate today. Franklin helped create America, and Poor Richard marks just one phase of his fascinating life. Surprisingly, only a single copy of the original 1733 almanac survived (according to the incredible Franklin Tercentenary exhibit which displayed the rare specimen). This reproduction faithfully presents Franklin's first almanac as printed by him. Fans of Benjamin Franklin or American history buffs should definitely pick one up 
 A great book for any business owner. 201 ideas from successful entrepeneurs across the country.  Each idea is between 1/2 to 1 1/2 pages long. This makes it easy reading and good for reference (mine is full of bookmarks). The format makes it easy to skip ideas that don't apply to you. This is a no-brainer for every entrepeneur. I bought 100 to give out as gifts 
 This is definately John's best CD of his 3. You just don't get tired of listening to it!! I used to hate rap with a passion, but now John Reuben is my one exception! It's fun music, and God is Love is an incredible spiritual for me. Buy it, and you'll be glad you did 
 This book is great but too short.  It sticks to the point and facts but leaves you wanting more 
 This is an interesting and informative DVD to gain a broader view of how the media operates, especially during the runup to the Iraq war. However, it is so jam-packed with information that it occasionally seems to gloss over important points or scenarios. There are some segments that I would have liked Schechter to have elaborated on and a few which could have been presented more clearly. As a member of a younger generation this DVD is great because it provides an informed picture of just how much the media is in bed with government. For me, it tied a lot of loose ends together in my head and gave me a broader view of how mass media functions. I disagree with another reviewer that Schechter was in the movie too much. He was narrating his own point of view and he stayed out of the way when it was appropriate. 
 Pulp magazines were long gone before I was even a gleam in my father's eye and yet they have always held a tremendous fascination for me and are one of the very few things I collect today.  The great thing about collecting pulps is that while many range into the thousands of dollars, many more such as the Sci-Fi pulps of the 50's are very affordable.  "The Incredible Pulps:  A Gallery of Fiction Magazine Art" focuses on one of the main reasons that people collect pulps...the incredible artwork, particularly those covers that just had to have mesmerized kids and adults back in the 30's and 40's.  Writer Frank M. Robinson (who also wrote the very excellent Pulp Culture) provides a brief, but enlightening history of pulp magazines, beginning with Argosy Magazines decision to move from slick magazine, to all-fiction pulp.  One of the great things about pulps is that they virtually could appeal to any person due to the diversity of subject matter.  The pulps covered it all:  crime, mystery, western, romance, adventure, war, horror, Sci-Fi, sports...if it had a possible audience, there was probably a pulp to suit them.  But perhaps the most popular were the hero pulps featuring characters like The Shadow, Doc Savage, and The Spider.  The popular misconception was that the pulps were written by hacks but some of the great writers of the first half of the 20th century wrote for pulps, among them:  Edgar Rice Burroughs, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Ray Bradbury, H.P. Lovecraft, and Frederick Faust AKA Max Brand.  But this book is not about the stories, but rather that beautiful, often terrifying and downright shocking artwork.  The artists are as legendary as the writers:  Virgil Finlay, J. Allen St. John, George Rozen, and Frank Kelly Freas to name just a few.  It was their job to create covers that would grab the attention of readers in a very crowded and competitive market.  Today their works are worth thousands and many of them are on display in this great collection.  The book reprints hundreds of pulp covers and is divided by four main genres:  Sci-Fi, Horror, Mystery/Detective, Adventure/Western.  The book provides the name and date of the issue and the artists name if known.  Tragically, so many of the artist names have been lost to history.  The covers are reprinted beautifully and seemingly from flawless copies of the pulp.  Frank Paul was one of the very early greats and did many classic covers for Amazing Stories in the 20's and 30's.  He was a man well ahead of his time and his imagination was limitless as his paintings foreshadowed many technical advances that would not take place for decades.  J. Allen St. John is best know for his Tarzan illustrations but a great cover in this book features Burroughs' other great character John Carter of Mars from Amazing Stories January 1941, for the story John Carter and the Giant of Mars.  My favorite pulps have always been the horror and weird menace pulps.  So gruesome were some of the covers that the government eventually had to step in and force the publishers to clean them up a bit.  One great cover is by Grave Gladney for Dime Mystery August 1937, showing a woman about to be sliced in half by a very large paper cutter.    George Rozen may be my favorite pulp artists of all-time.  His Shadow covers were beautifully sinister.  The cover to Shadow January 1933 is one of the all-time great covers showing a skeletal shadow emerging from behind a curtain.  You think gore is a product of modern times?  Then check out Rudolph Relarski's cover to Thrilling Detective from August 1940.  It shows a table full of decapitated heads and a man locked in a stock, about to be the next victim of an evil Asian's sword.  The book reprints numerous Rozen Shadow and Doc Savage covers.    It's really a great little book that anyone who is a pulp or pop culture illustration fan will love.  I do have a couple of minor complaints though.  First, there are no cover reprints from Weird Tales, arguably the most famous pulp ever.  I can only assume that since Weird Tales is still being produced that perhaps the rights could not be obtained.  Since there is no Weird Tales covers there are no examples, and not even a mention of Margaret Brundage, one of the truly great pulp cover artists.  That aside, I highly recommend this book.

 Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is really a manual for living.  So much of what he teaches is very relevant for today.  "If you don't have a consistent goal in life, you can't live in a consistent way."  The book is actually a lot of short to the point lessons for living a better life.  "If you seek tranquillity, do less."  "Which brings a double saftisfaction to do less, better."  That is a philosophy that we all would do well to ponder and then employ.  Another of my favorite bits of wisdom, "Not to assume it's impossible because you find it hard. But to recognize that if it's humanly possible, you can do it too."  Marcus Aurelius spends a lot of time on death and how to approach it.  Some of that is very good.  However he also spends a lot of time thinking about man's right and priviledge of deciding if and when to end live voluntary.   There is an excellent though somewhat long introduction to the book.  Hays also provides a list of persons referred to in the book.  This is very helpful to at least know who Aurelius was talking about.  I only rate the book four stars because I found The Emperior's Handbook by David Hicks easier to read and understand.  I recommend that everyone read at least one of the books by Marcus Aurelius.  If you can only read one, pick The Emperor's Handbook 
 It is a rare person that has no curiosity about what "lies beyond."  The recent popularity of TV programs and movies that deal in some way with the afterlife speaks to this inherent desire to know "is there really a heaven?"   In spite of our eagerness to know - we also are quick to discredit accounts by individuals who claim to have experienced death, and returned with first-hand evidence of the reality of a realm beyond this one.  Don Piper is one of those individuals.  He was silent for many years, but now, thanks to his collaboration with ghostwriter Cec Murphy,  his story is available - to believe, or to scoff.   I don't think  Don Piper really cares anymore what people think.  There is enough evidence to prove his death had a purpose, and enough pain to prove his life has a purpose.  The story is more than another life after death encounter.  For a Christians, it is a challenge to the depth of one's faith and one's commitment to the belief in an omniscient God.  It is the ultimate story that addresses the question "what am I doing here?"   Sure - we all want to know what heaven is like.  We want more than the scriptures offer us.  We want details!  Read Don's story.  You will get details, and you will still long for more.  You will thrill with hope, and hope for more thrills.  Most of all, you will wonder.   
 I was overjoyed when I began reading this book.  I have been a phone sex operator for more than 10 years, with MANY of my clients being "boys who want to be girls".  As part of my ongoing learning experience, I bought this book, and was THRILLED when I read it.  The book doesn't condescent, isn't "Domme", and isn't a boring critical read.  No, it doesn't give as many tips as one might expect, but it allows crossdressers to see themselves in a positive light, to learn that they are "OK" instead of abnormal, to see that one should walk with pride (and more than a bit of grace), instead of hiding out in the closet, fondling the pretty dresses instead of wearing them.  The message is upbeat, humorous, and wholly positive.  Thank you Miss Vera for helping to bring sexuality into the mainstream 
 to enjoy this book.  Piercy paints a picture of a corporate run world that is ravaged by pollution and crime.  Only a few free cities remain.  This book, however, also deals with family relationships as much as the unusual sexual relationship between a woman and a cyborg.  There is still divorce and child custody and an aging grandmother so I found it easy to relate to the characters.  I very much enjoyed this and also loved her "Woman on the Edge of Time. 
 This is a great game. However, I can only play it at a friend's house. Even though I pre-ordered it from Toys 'R Us in July, it somehow is not getting shipped to me until November! I wish I could play it at my own home 
 Very comprehensive but somewhat esoteric. This handbook is not for casual reading, but yields results for specific research. The more the book is consulted, one has a better understanding of how the information is presented. The handbook contains a wealth of material 
 Yeah, He's my favorite I dubbed recently. This is only the first CD I ever purchased from him at Borders. I love the way that he moves the flavor w/ a more mature sound w/ a smooth taste to it. I always love the vocals and scats that he did on this album. Prove to me, this is highly recommended as a must-have to those that don't listen to jazz pretty often. If for those that are not feelin' it, don't buy it.  Norman, keep doing your thing man and would love for you to put another CD. I look forward of working with you. I'm officially a trumpet player 
 About the Hupalo's reveiw... This reviewer doesn't know what he's talking about. And all he does it give opinions. The E-Myth was recommended to me a decade ago by a very successful advertizing executive on a flight from Seattle into LA and then on his way to scuba dive the Barrier Reef for a month. The E-Myth provides the best way to view the various aspects of "getting there" and has even helped me in my work at the large commercial aircraft company I work for. It helped me through years of working my own side business and the recent E-Myth Manager book made me realize its time to go back to grad school (which is where I am now). Amazingly one level Gerber's books are the best "self help books out there"  I feel sorry for all the readers who didn't buy the book because of Hupalo's or other negative reviews 
 A beautiful and diverse album. A little bit of everything that is Toussaint. Only few can touch a piano like him. I once read in an interview that "In Your Love" was one of the songs he was most proud of composing-and for very good reason. If you have not had the pleasure of listening to any of Mr. Toussaint's releases please do. He is not only a legend but a preserver of New Orleans' music and heritage.  I also highly recomend his new Jazzity Project CD entitled "Going Places." It smokes! Jazz the Toussaint way. If you can't find it anywhere check out www.louisianamusicfactory.co 
 Bryan Savage has long been a great sax and flute player and a good composer. Now he has gone to the next level with Rush Hour... it's got great compositions, great playing, and great arrangements/production of the tunes. These are the kind of songs that you expect to be used in good movie scenes. The title cut smokes, and I predict will go high on the jazz charts. My favorite tracks are: Rush Hour (you can't sit still to this one), Scenic Route (dreamy), Wind River (sexy tango), Innuendo (haunting), and the remix of Coral Princess (3rd Force at its best). Bryan has included remakes as usual--this time excellent jazz versions of Sunny and My Cherie Amour. This is one great blend of smooth jazz numbers, and there's not one on the CD that you will want to skip 
 As conservative Judge Richard Posner pointed out in the New York Times Book Review (Dec 19, 1999), Ms. Himmelfarb unwittingly makes quite the opposite case from the one she intended to make, criticizing an American  society that could easily impress an observer as being on its "moral  uppers". This book should be read alongside Alan Wolfe's "One  Nation After All" published a year earlier. Wolfe's book, based on  hundreds of interviews conducted for the Middle Class Morality Project of  the centrist Russell Sage Foundation, found that most Americans, both  liberal and conservative, have developed a complex moral and theological  style that holds fast to traditional values while embracing religious and  cultural diversity. A better informed population is now more likely to  substitute individual conscience and personal responsibility for blind  acceptance of authority. The book concluded that the "culture  war" theory of America was largely a fiction cooked up by right wing  intellectuals and the news media --- which habitually portray the country  in terms of stereotyped divisions over moral, racial, and social issues 
 My interest in the band "Garbage" led me to this book - its title was used by them to create a chillingly magnificent song on their second CD. I found the book itself to be one of the most creative and compelling works I read this year. The story it tells gets under your skin to such a point that I don't recommend it for those already depressed. For the rest of us, it is a chilling look inside a sympathetic character, a young woman dancing around the border between sanity and madness. She knows she is on the verge of losing it all, and knows she is not getting the kind of help she needs from anyone - least of all the mediocre medical personnel who see her as just one more casefile. Yet she's unable to shake the helplessness and displays the lack of will to take control of her own life which is so often found in the insane and/or suicidal. Galloway makes extremely skilled use of innovative page layouts and even unexpected graphics to really show us her character's imbalanced view of the world. We see through her eyes 
 This compilation, while not comprehensive, either on The Police or Sting's solo career has good songs, just not very complete. What is here is good and the sound is very good, but this is for the most casual of The Police/Sting's fans. If you like a little of the Police and a little of Sting solo, this should be ok 
 This was a great book! In my opinion it deserved 5 stars. Plenty of characters made it an absolute page-turner 
 I would give this product a 5 star rating but it just came out and there are a few very small problems. I'm sure Microsoft will fix them in future updates. One problem: when trying to insert an image it freezes when going to the directory which holds the image, you can back out and continue without any problems. A work around is to drag and drop the image. I miss some of the features FrontPage has, like, photo gallery web components(counter, marquee etc.) But, you can cut and paste code from FrontPage to Expression web and they will work. So, don't get rid of the FrontPage 2003 you can us some of its features with Expression Web. Expression web is a world class product many more features than FrontPage (CSS, ASP.NET,XHTML etc).  If you are a web designer like me you will see what I mean when you use this product. Not mentioned in the advertising Expression Web comes with a second DVD with several hours of instructional movies on applications using this product.  
 If you want to learn about volatility, this is the book for you. This is more advanced than a basic volatility book, so beginners and advanced students of volatility will benefit.  Also, if you are actively trading options, this book is often quoted, so you may want to get it just so that you could follow what people are saying 
 Khayree is known for making some heavy basslines and nice tracks. On this album it shows how good he really is. I was chillin watching videos in 95' and ''in the game'' came on. As soon as I heard the beat I was blown away, then ray luvs flow was just tears up the track. I knew from then that this whole album would be heavy because of hearing that track, it showed the quality was just shining and there was something there to get. Not long after, I picked it up and it's been a favourite since too. I love this album so much, theres so many rappers ray luv blows away. The bay area was represented right by this man in 95. If you are looking for a classic oakland style or any style classic really, you need to pick this up straight or lose out. Its my favourite ray luv album too. Straight through, start to finish classic. Later 
 Hope Mirrlees originally published this marvelous book back in the 1920s, to some acclaim at the time.  The book then was forgotten by all except a few lovers of fantasy until it was republished by the now legendary "sign of the unicorn" series put out by Ballentine in the 1960s and early 70s.  Many authors have tried, with varying degrees of success, to achieve what Mirrlees does so effortlessly:  She brings a true sense of the mystery and wonder to this story of a people who live on the borders of fairlyland.  In this book, we learn about Nathaniel Chanticleer and his son.  About a people who would rather not see fairyland, but who are in some ways inextricably linked.  I don't want to say too much, or give too much away about this wondrous story, but I would like to say that one phrase has stuck with me for a long time:  One character accidentally wears yellow to a funeral, and then comments that it was, "after all, a blackish sort of yellow."  True words of the genuine synesthete, yes; but also true words of those who have touched the fe.  I am just delighted that this is back in print.  I hope everyone reads and enjoys it!  
 Now i dont usually write reviews for things, but when i do its because i really like it or i really hate it. And i must say this is one of the best, if not the best music magazine out there. But before you go on if you like bands like simple plan or new found glory just stop and go read something else. this magazine is for indie rock fans or just plain rock. They give you reviews on at least 30 albums and have great interviews with artists. Now this is not like "Spin" who jumps on anything that is popular at the moment to make some money. I enjoyed reading this summers issue ( with Death Cab for Cutie on the front) so much that I ordered it the day i got the magazine. A must have for indie fans 
 The Young Entrepreneur's Edge is not so much a how-to book on starting your own business, but is really a "how-to-cope-with-life-while-starting-and-succeeding-in-your-own-business-book."  I have read many books on starting your own business and this book has some very unique advice because it is geared towards younger entrepreneurs.  Jennifer Kushell offers some practical advice about selecting the right business for you, writing a business plan, getting funded, etc.  But what sets the book apart are its sections on not having any credit or not having good credit, using interns instead of full time employees, how to get mentors and advisors, how to present a professional image despite of your youthful looking appearance, dealing with family and friends who don't support your decision, how not to starve, etc.   The only complaint that I had about the book was that some sections were not very complete on their advice.  It is true that there are lots of other books out there on subjects such as marketing and business plans and so on, but if the author was just going to recommend that we look elsewhere, why did she include a chapter on that topic in the book in the first place?  Some of the information is a little dated, but not too bad.  I also would have like to have seen more resources to go to in the back of the book as to where to go to get that information that she doesn't cover in the book.   Regardless, if you are a twenty-something or younger entrepreneur, there are some really helpful hints to be found in this book and it is well worth your time to read for Jennifer Kushell's upbeat attitude and encouragement.  She is absolutely right in that there is no better time for young entrepreneurs to go into business then now, when we have little or nothing to lose 
 At first you think its "Memoirs of a Geisha", but this one has far too many details for that. Its court life in Japan with all its back stabbing rivalries. This book takes you back to a time when a woman was not seen and barely heard, yet they commanded men to cross oceans for just one possible look at their beauty. This long (very long) novel is interspersed with what may seem like a thousand little poems, and each one is a gem. I suggest you read this book if you are interested in: Japan, women's roles in Asian cultures, or if you just want a good read 
 This masterpiece by Rabbi Dr. Akiva Tatz is sure to become a favorite.  The ideas on life, living, happiness, inspiration, etc. contained in this book will have you re-reading it for the second, third, and fourth time.  The deep philosophical ideas presented in the work are a culmination of thousands of years of information from  Jewish knowledge treasure chests, such as the Bible, Talmud, Zohar, early sages such as Maimonides,  later wisdom by Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin to recent sages like Rabbi E. Dessler.  Also see Anatomy of a Search, Worldmask, and Reb Simcha Speaks by the same autho 
 This book is great.  The only bad thing was when Derek ended up in a coma. Brian had to bring him down the RIVER and get to a trading post. You're going to love it!! 
 I loved this book... I thought it was amazing how the author spoke through the voice of a character that was obviously totally different than herself... a man for starters.  I thought it was hip, fun, imaginitive, and delt with one of the most universl issues in humanity... how our childhoods effect our decisons and our perceptions in our adult life.  I loved it.. and thought it was much better that IN THE DRINK.... That was a good book... but it was such a downer... JEREMEY THANE on the other hand was filled with hope.  I can't wait for the next one!!! 
 An extraordinary film, The Vanishing, brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the American Northwest. The movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller type of category. Kiefer Sutherland, Jeff Bridges, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!   The setting, the plot (Jeff's strong sense of love, devotion, and determination are admirable and commendable, and an example for all to follow!), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! In short, The Vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 
 This is a clear and well written book devoted to the premise that the way to prosper at the racetrack is to seek value in your betting methodology.  It is one of those books you read and afterwards say, "Of course, that  is so obvious."  The only criticism I have is that it really doesn't  give you much insight into learning how to assign probabilities to the  various horses in any particluar race.  You are told this is vital to your  success or failure but are not given a methodology designed to help you  assign those probabilities.  Still this is one of the best books ever  written about parimutual gambling 
 I purchased this book for a CSS class that I was taking.  The book is good, it does cover a lot of information.  I found that it was not the only book that I was using.  I had an old HTML book that I used for reference more often then not.  It is one that I liked for things like Color codes.  The CSS book does not reference these, and if it does, it is not that easy to find.    Agian it is a very good book, but not the only one that you should have for reference 
 ...you have to read the book!  SubUrbia is one of my favorite movies, and I thought I'd read it also.  There are several parts in the book that didn't make it to the movie.  Also, I finished it in two sittings, so it's not very time consuming 
 Cooking is something I have always wanted to know how to do better, but could never find an appropriate resource to show me the way. I bought this massive book in a London bookshop, and have been using it frequently ever since. While some of the terminology uses "British" english as opposed to "American", which may have some of us running to the grocer to find out just exactly what that strange vegetable she is referring to is, the book is overwhelmingly useful and informative. Like the title says, it is a complete cookery course, and you learn more about the uses and methods of the various utensils and cookware than in any other cookbook I have seen. Granted, if you buy all of it, you need a bigger kitchen than I have just to store the pots and pans. Regardless, it's a fun as well as informative read, with practically everything you can imagine ever wanting to cook between its pages 
 One doesn't have to have read Martel's previous novel featuring these unsavory characters to enjoy (?) its successor.  What a nasty piece of work is our Muriel Axton!  Admittedly, her horrendous upbringing by a lunatic  mother gives her meager brain sufficient cause to seek sadistic revenge  upon those she sees to be her enemies, but how fortuitous it is that fate  so often cooperates with her!  Martel is positively brilliant at keeping   the convoluted plot going full pace at all times --the reader is never  absolutely certain as to just what will happen, but knows that whatever  does, it will not be pleasant. The mordant wit is most enjoyable to those  of us who appreciate such nice touches! Regardless of the genre she  chooses, Martel is a gifted writer and a pleasure to read 
 Every year or so I re-read "Heartburn," one of my favorite novels of all time.  It is fall-on-the-floor-funny, and possibly the best and most memorable form of revenge that a spurned wife ever had.  Today's re-reading of "Heartburn" was inspired by the revelation that Mark Felt is the real name of Deep Throat, the former FBI mole who fed Watergate information to Ephron's former husband, Carl Bernstein.  In this roman a clef, the chatacter based on cheating-husband Bernstein is called "Mark Feldman."  Today I read Ephron's admission, in the Huffington Post blog, that living with the knowledge of Deep Throat's true identity was a "very heavy burden."  So, was her estranged husband's character name inspired consciously by Deep Throat's name, or subconsciously?  I don't really need an answer to that question.  However, it does prove that the novels we love are gifts that keep on giving.  Thanks, Nora.  Thanks, Mr. Felt--for everything 
 There is a reason this book is ubiquitous among students studying for USMLE Step 1: it gets results. It contains a section giving advice for studying for the test, high-yield facts and figures for the subjects, and reviews of other resources. It is a great value for the price. The best way to use this is as a master study-guide. Get it early 2nd year and use it with your courses as you go along. Also, get a long (9-12 month) subscription to Kaplan's QBank (another Step 1 necessity) and do those questions as you go along with your courses. Make notes in your copy and turn it into the perfect resource to use for Step 1, and study it over and over. Ideally, you'll have gone through First Aid a few times and done all the QBank questions by the end of 2nd year. If you can do this, you'll be very well prepared for the test while all your classmates are flipping out. There are some areas that First Aid needs some first aid of its own. Physiology, being more concepts based, is not suited for quick review with high-yield facts. Path and micro are also too broad for short review. The anatomy (gross, histo, and embryo) is somewhat weaker in first aid, but these subjects are not highly represented on the test anyway. So, for supplementary review, use BRS Physiology and Pathology, and Clinical Microbiology Made Ridiculously Simple. If you have time, you can consider High-Yield Behavioral Science and High-Yield Gross, Histo, or Neuro, but don't get bogged down with anatomy, as it is a small part of the test. Unfortunately, there are some disciplines in medicine that will be very hard to get into unless you have high board scores, and Step 1 is generally considered to be the more important of the Steps as far as getting a residency goes. If you prepare early and study high-yield material again and again, and practice, practice, practice doing questions, you will ace the exam. Don't try to know everything. I scored a 252/99 on the test, and if you're reading this review, you can do as well or better. Get it now, use it, and ace the test 
 I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE DVD(IN 3D) NOT THE VHS(2D).THIS FILM AIRED ON TV AS A CHRISTMAS 30 MINUTE SPECIAL IN 1997(IN 2D).THEN IN 2002 IMAX DECIDED TO RELEASE THE FILM AS A 3D IMAX FEATURE.KIDS AND ADULTS FLOCKED THE IMAX 3D SHOWINGS.THEY WERE IN SHOCK  AS SNOWFLAKES AND REINDEER CAME OFF THE SCREEN RIGHT AT THEM.THE FILM IS NOW ON DVD (IN GLORIOUS 3D).I GOT THIS FILM AND I PUT ON THE 3D GLASSES.AND I HAVE A 28 INCH TV AND THW 3D ACTUALLY IS AWESOME.THE SNOWFLAKS ACTAULLY LOOK LIKE THERE FALLING IN YOUR LIVING ROOM.AND OTHER THINGS COMES OFF THE SCREEN REALLY FAR,EVEN ON MY 13 INCH TV !!!! 
 A forty-storey lighthouse straight out of George Lucas's imagination - but it did exist 2000 years ago, mathematical formulae measuring the Earth's circumference to unbelievable accuracy based on a well and a stick, a long-lost library including theories about the world not being flat written millenia before the Catholic Church condeded the point, and an accessible turn of phrase make this a good read for students or fans of the ancient world, that criss-cross of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Jewish, Christian and Muslim civilisations. 
 Doing a review of The Heart of the Ribhu Gita tonight, it occurred to me that I should do a review of this book as well, since the two are tied in my mind as the most sublime of all Hindu writings.  I have had an old copy of the root text of this book (The Ashtavakra Gita/Samhita), translated and printed in India in 1981, that I have always dearly loved. I used to take it with me wherever I went and was reading it constantly. I recall one morning early when I was reading it on the shuttle back to the San Francisco airport from Santa Rosa where I had travelled the night before from New Mexico at somebody's insistence to attend an all-night ayahuasca ceremony, back when such things seemed important, probably the late 1980s. So, in rather an altered state still, and high on these beautiful verses, suddenly someone yells out from the back of the shuttle, "The Ashtavakra Samhita?!!!" Turns out I'm sharing the shuttle with a couple of Da Free John devotees, so we had a good old time the whole way to the airport discussing the Samhita, as well as the Tripura Rahasya, the Avadhuta Gita and other such esoteric lore. Perhaps, only in California, and perhaps, for me, only back then!  When this rendition by Thomas Byrom came out a few years later I was hesitant to even look at it, loving my old one so, and having become rather jaded by the many poorly written renditions of the Hindu and Buddhist classics that were hitting the market. But I was most pleasantly surprised: turns out I was, and remain, very deeply impressed with Mr. Byrom's fresh and modern translation. It is outstanding in every sense. So open. So light. Capturing in its tone just the sort of liberating outlook these verses are talking about. See the difference from these two approaches to the same verse:  OLD:  He who has realized that change in the form of existence and destruction is in the nature of things, easily finds repose, being unperturbed and free from pain.  NEW: All things arise,  Suffer change,  And pass away.  This is their nature.  When you know this, Nothing perturbs you,  Nothing hurts you.  You become still.  It is easy.   Or, see the difference in the last verse of the work, my favorite:  OLD:  Where is existence, where is non-existence; where is unity, where is duality? What need is there to say more? Nothing emanates from me.  NEW: For I have no bounds.  I am Shiva.  Nothing arises in me, In whom nothing is single,  Nothing is double.  Nothing is, Nothing is not.  What more is there to say?  Granted, there is a bit of creative license at play here in Mr. Byrom's translation, since, for example, in this instance there is no mention or even suggestion of Shiva in the original verse. But such liberties on his part actually seem to enhance the work in just the right way, and I believe he captures the spirit of the work beautifully, and the spirit of the work is beyond my capacity to praise. Highly recommended. Read it.  What more is there to say?     
 The Baseball Economist is a fantastic read. A big strength of the book is that neither a background in economics or an obsession with baseball is required to enjoy it. Bradbury's writing is clear and his enthusiasm is evident. The book is not just for citizen economists and baseball enthusiasts, but for any truth-seeker in the general public who is looking for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read 
 The little Red Hen is one of the cute stories out there for kids that actually have morals to implement within the story itself. It's teaches the moral of helping and what happens if you just sit down and do nothing but when the job is done, you would get nothing either if you don't help.  Little Red Hen found some wheat on the ground and did all the work of growing it, cutting it, grinding it and even to the baker to bake it into bread all by herself because the other animals refuse to even help her to do all of the process above. but in the end when it's all ready to be eaten, the rest jumped up to offer to help her to eat it, but of course, Little Red Hen won't have it their way, for she has done all the work by herself with none of their help so she could do without them this time too 
 This book was awesome.  Anyone who is a big Danielle Steele fan would love this book.  Or even if you happen to run across her in searching for things to read this would be a great book for those who have just started reading her books to read.  You remember her books as well.  No other author has just allowed me to do that.  She is a very unique writer.  As I was reading, I can remember the plots and storylines of the other books that she has written.  This is by far got to be the best that she has written 
 I remember the first time that I came across Brian Tracy's material when I was 18 years old. I must admit that I have been very fortunate that I have.   When I was growing up as a teenager, coming from a disadvantaged background, I thought that people that were better off than me were just lucky. I thought that luck was something that happened to people and that there was nothing that anyone could do about it. In other words, I thought that people that were happy, people that were successful, and people that lead happy and fulfilling lives were just lucky. I thought that people's lives were destined. But as I grew older I witnessed people that used to be known as "losers" starting to succeed, and "winners" starting to fail. By my late teens the whole concept of luck and destiny did not quite make sense to me. I refused to accept that my whole life was a product of chance, luck, and destiny. I started to look for answers, answers that no one in my environment could give me.   Then, one day while looking for my answers, I ran across one of Brian Tracy's articles about success on the net. I was amazed by Brian's knowledge, professionalism, and writing style. The next day I went to the library to find some of his books. The only book that I could find was his "The Luck Factor" Audio Book, which came in handy since I hated to read.   Then I decided to purchase Maximum Achievement. This was the first book that I have read from cover to cover and my life has never been the same ever since. The principles in this book are nothing new or innovational, they are merely simple and while reading you will often catch yourself saying over and over again: "That is so true! I should have known about this! Why didn't I think of this a long time ago?" But don't let that discourage you from getting this book.  Brian Tracy is the best self help professional in the world and I would not recommend anybody else but him. There are many "self help" gurus and books out there, but as you read their material you will start to notice inconsistencies and contradictions in their work. As with Brian Tracy, I have not found any contradiction, inconsistency, or lies in his work. And I am very sensitive when it comes to people trying to teach me some "cool stuff". I check every reference, every background, and every quote that I can. Brian Tracy's integrity has never disappointed me. I would have given this book 10 stars if I could because it's still one of the best books that I have ever read!   I have read many books after this one, but only a few were worth every penny and every second that I have invested in reading as this one! 
 This book is very well written.  It covers all the questions you have when starting to play an instrument as an adult.  It also has motivational quotes and words of wisdom that you will want to read again and again. My piano teacher lent it to me, and I was so impressed I ordered my own copy 
 its the best of the good stuff, it even had the Kenshin song I like so much 
 Many have commented on LaVey's sharp perception of women in this book.  That's not so suprising when one knows his wife and High Priestess was a silent co-writer of this book, and Anton LaVey no doubt found her, his "ideal woman" a model of the Satanic Witch 
 I was fortunate enough to become involved in a local church's Shoebox Project. Volunteers assemble shoeboxes to be given by social workers to children being taken out of their homes. Included are necessities like toothbrushes, packs of cards, pencils, etc. I did a fundraiser to buy books as well, and then came the hard part, choosing books which would appeal to every child under the worst kind of stress.   I picked The Witches for the upper elementary group. It's funny, exciting, and scary. 
 This chronology of Hooker recordings is simply awesome! To walk through the progression of songs from early recordings to the present is simply mesmerizing. Some titles are repeated throughout the 4 disc set put are clearly an evolution of the artist. It is clear why he influenced so many artists, too. You can't go wrong with this set 
 This is the best book I've ever read.....almost.  After the first few pages, when it seems young girls are disappearing and found dead, I threatened the recommender with dismemberment b/c I have little girls at home.  But as I kept on, I was hooked.  It is well written with a phenomenal ending.  Not for those who read the last pages first.  
 Imitation of Christ was highly recommended to me and it did not disappoint 
 This is a simply marvelous book: well written, interesting, and informative. Prof. Kelly is that rara avis, an academic who can write. I highly recommend this book to the operatic newcomer and professional alike 
 This is an eminently sensible and readable book. It is very well written and explains the Bible in a way that does not require resorting to literalism. My only complaint is that the author does not cover the whole Bible. Many books of the Old Testament are skipped; he essentially discusses only the creation stories and Isaiah. In the New Testament, much also is skipped. We never hear of Hebrews or Romans, or the smaller books, for example. However, what he does treat is treated well, Revelation being a very good example. Fundamentalists and literalists need to read this book. Much dissension in Biblical interpretation would vanish. Another topic not discussed is that covered by Bart Ehrman in his book "Misquoting Jesus", in which Ehrman discusses the various types of errors that have crept into the Bible thru copying mistakes and deliberate "corrections". How these affect Biblical interpretation is not discussed by this author. I guess that's Ehrman's territory. More discussion of the other books of the Bible would have earned this book 5 stars. 
 Item as described and received in a timely manner... an excellent buying experience 
 Green Day in my opinion were one of the greatest groups in history! Warning is their best before American Idiot. To all the one star reviewers below known as, STEVE MORSE, PINK FLOYD'S SAMURAI, THE INFIDEL, MR. CRANKY, LED ZEPPELIN ROCKS, SIX SIXTEEN, I don't need your opinion of Green Day. They were the greatest group along with Dire Straits, and Foreigner. Their albums are good. The band that you love like ACDC are horrible. And the bands you hate were LEGENDS!!!!!!  Warning is absolutely the greatest song ever recorded in HISTORY!! Get this. Green Day are legends 
 As Po Bronson put it himself, this book is not about life or careers, let's not get trapped in the semantics - this book is about 'people who dared to be honest with themselves'. He doesn't write about rising stars, nor miraculous transformations, his book is about real people confronting their everyday life. For good or for worse, each story focuses on a life of a different individual - some of them succeed, others fade. You have to approach this book with an open and  a receptive mind, it will make you contemplate your own life choices and future direction.  I'm young, but it made me think twice about my future, my career, my goals and how I am going to get there - I feel like I have a better perspective now, thanks Po. 
 This is not a book on how to play the piano, even though learning chords is probably more than half the battle, this book does everything it says it does, it teaches you the most common chord structures and progressions in most popular music.  I sat down at my keyboard and played one of the progressions, they are very effective, and I had heard them before in other songs.  The notation is very intuitive for the none music reading songwriters-to-be.  It shows the keyboard visually on the page with dots on the keys to be struck for the chord.  All in all this is an excellent book, with a nice cd letting you listen to the progressions to get a better idea of them, one motto from the book is not too worry about what chord you are playing, if it sounds good 
 This book was so much more than I expected. A fun, easy read than made me examine how much our culture really dictates our lives as women, moms, wives and lovers. What I gained most from the book was the ideas of social eating. We now have a sit down breakfast in the morning with little to no extra trouble, but has changed our mornings into a calmer more unified morning. I stoped defining myself as the tipicle American running in all directions, mom of three children under the age of five. We can savor each moment...and no more starbucks to go. I now go sit, ask for a mug to drink my cofee in and truly enjoy those extra calories.  
 Congratulations,you've just stumbled upon the web page of the most gifted guitar player to ever walk the earth. Browse Amazon all you want, you won't find anybody better than Danny Gatton. Quick, name a guitar player who is equally adept at rock, pop, jazz, blues, country, rockabilly, and swing. Any style of music that can be done on guitar, Danny Gatton could do it better, faster, with more feeling, and just plain cooler than anybody else. Here's a guy who paid his dues in the music business. He was a musical prodigy who started playing guitar at age 9. He formed his first band at 12. As a young man he learned the finer points of guitar playing from the late great Roy Buchanan. He was one of the most sought after session men in Nashville. In 1989 Guitar World Magazine named Gatton the "Worlds Greatest Unknown Guitarist". That led to a 2 record deal with Elektra Records. His first major record contract at the age of 44. That brings us to this first record for Elektra, "88 Elmira St." This is the one I still consider his best overall album. A few of the outstanding songs on here: "Elmira St.Boogie", which has some rockabilly licks that sound like Eddie Cochran on speed. Gatton overdubs his guitar here to make 2 leads going full throttle at the same time. I've never heard anything quite like this one, especially on a rockabilly song. Fantastic. He gets into some blues on "Blues Newburg", a slow meandering song that's contrasted by some of the fastest guitar licks Gatton ever burned onto aluminum. He changes pace on here with the Lex Baxter standard "Quiet Village", a jumpy little number that's got some fast, yet very beautiful guitar work. Outside of Les Paul, Danny Gatton is the only one I think who could pull this off effectivly. And finally, the gorgeous cover of Brian Wilson's "In My Room", that's got the most beautiful guitar work on the album. The arrangments on this song are sheer heaven. Just put the headphones on and listen to Danny trading note for note with himself while going from one speaker to the next. If you don't like this one, you don't like guitar, period. It's too bad Elektra dropped Gatton after his 2 records failed to make enough money to put their kids through college. It goes to show ya talent means absolutley nothing in the music business. And I think after all his dues paying, that letdown is what help contribute to Gatton's suicide. But Gatton still lives on through his diverse catalog of music. And Elmira St. is an excellent place to start. Highly recommended 
 I couldn't believe there existed so much information on this subject.  I'm a student of the humanities and this is right up my alley.  The inclusion of original documents in Greek and Latin have made this book a relic. One should feel gratified that through this book one can own a piece of  history.  I have read many books on history and I can assertively say this  is one of the best.  Imagine, why read a book on christian history when you  can go straight to the source and discover for yourself. I thank goodness  there are people who still care about publishing such important things 
 Bueller, Ferris Bueller  OK, lets start off with what wrong with this edition of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  there are two problem  I see with this new Bueller Bueller DVD edition of Ferris...One is the over use of actor/know it all Ben Stein and the missing director John Hughes's missing audio commentary.  Now the good news. There are extras like a few great documentries with most of the cast talking about this movie.   And then there is the movie itself-The extras are fine. However the film is a minor classic.   Matthew Broderick emits an air of whimsey with a wink of his eye. Broderick's odyseey of adventure isnt lost on his audience. He is part Robert Preston from the Music Man/Part W.C. Fields/Part Robert Wagner from  It Takes a Thief. Broderick playing Ferris is slick, sly and a con man with style. He pokes a stick of his collective eye of Principal Jeffrey (Deadwood) Jones and we are laughing at his antics with enjoyment.  The supportive cast of Alan (Spin City) Ruck and Mia Sara makes a sorta lover's triangle without love nor passion..more deeper friendship. The two combined with Broderick makes this film a buddy movie, rather than a TEEN  angst film (like Not another Teen Movies or Ten Things I hate about you)  So want to laugh and enjoy the system being poked, get this film  and as Ferris would say, "What are you Still doing here? Why aren't you buying this yet?"  Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL 
 Robin Williams was perfectly cast as Jakob Heim.  The critics hated this movie, but I enjoyed it alot.  This is one of my favorite Robin Williams films, next to Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society.  This is a great Holocaust movie and you should buy it or at least rent it 
  For century's it has been back and forth and back and forth. When will it ever end. We have three great religions preaching peace but waging war 
 Not only is the content accurate and informative, it is presented in a very interesting manner...with photos and illustrations.  
 I've used Epson's Premium Glossy, Colorlife and Heavyweight Matte.  The Matte is far cheaper and gives beautiful results.  I've actually found that I like the Matte best for framing.  It has a less reflective surface and looks more 'arty' than photographic. But I wouldn't recommend it for architectural, detailed photographs.  A good benefit of both the Matte and Colorlife is that they have the longest rated life without fading of any paper for use with Epson's dye based printers.  
 Lately I've been disappointed more often than not by the newer graphic novels and compendiums that have hit the store shelves but in the case of Vengeance I have to say this is really good stuff. Jeff Loeb introduces an all new team of superheroes called the Maximums that seem oddly familiar. The team is an extremely blatant homage to the Avengers/Ultimates including a mythical Viking, a super soldier, a giant man named skyscraper and so on and so forth. The team even includes doppelgangers of Spider Man and Wolverine. This is not an Avengers rip off but a playful imitation of Marvel's super team and it's pretty clear that this is likely a one time appearance for the Maximums. Late in the story there is a nod to fans of The Ultimates when the Maximums are merged into a single being called The `Ultimate' Warrior (or is it a nod to fans of the worst pro-wrestler ever). Meanwhile Batman and Superman are merged into a single being called the Composite Superman and believe me I'm old enough to remember the original Composite Superman. It's these kinds of nods and winks running through the story that made it so enjoyable.  Vengeance is a pretty wild tale, featuring parallel universes filled with piles of alternate versions of Superman, Batman and Supergirl as well as an all new Bizarro take on Batman named Batzarro. Batzarro may actually be the single best part of the entire story. Jeff Loeb was particularly meticulous in making sure that every single phrase spoken by Bizarro and Batzarro are indeed in reverse of their meaning and it becomes rather enjoyable to try and decode their actual intent. Despite the craziness of the story (which includes The Joker and Mr. Mxyzptlk) the author manages to keep it from becoming muddled and incoherent which is often the result in stories with this many characters and swerves. Mr. Loeb also does a good job of tying the story in with previous story arc's including `Public Enemies' and `Absolute Power'.  I am a big fan of Ed McGuinness's illustrations. His art is rather cartoonish but that doesn't bother me. As always he manages to produce very clean and consistent images. I have to confess that I'm extremely surprised that Vengeance isn't getting better reviews since I found it to be a very enjoyable read. 
 I am neither a parent nor a teacher, but I found this well-written, insightful book eye-opening.I bought it as a "suggested reading"  gift for the parents of a young girl I have been mentoring, but could not  put it down after reading the introduction! Ms. Stepp's intermingling of  real life examples with research from the experts revealed so many things  that a non-parent can do to change the world by helping children navigate  early adolescence. Her inclusion of African American children among her  subjects, and her sensitive treatment of the special problems their lives  present brought her book home for me 
 I loved this book! The combination of personal growth/intraspection, Virginia history and horses is just more than I can pass up.  The plot of historical time travel was a novel (no pun intended) approach and very enjoyable 
 Alice James interests many as not only the sister of two great writers but as an example of a writer struggling to make her voice heard against the torrents of misogyny and dreadful illness.  Her diary is ably edited by Leon Edel, and contains a lot of shrewd portrait-painting of her brothers (including the third, not-famous brother who sparkles throughout this diary, even though he left this life without a shadow), as well as some general philosophy.  She is ever ready to remind herself that she is a child of privilege, and yet a trace of self-pity remains, like some stubborn stain that proves unexpectedly difficult to scrub out.  "What an awful loss it is that we can't see our own follies," James writes, "they must be so much more exquisite than any one's else, but as vanity is what keeps the world agoing, after one or two convulsive laughs, the game would certainly be up!  "Shall I ever have any convulsive laughs again!  Ah, me!  I fear me not.  I had such a feast for 34 years that I can't complain."  Anyone who wants to know about American writing at the turn of the century should get a copy of this book.  "What difference is there in the spiritual essence of two viragoes fighting on their door-steps over a coal-ticket, left or not left by the district visitor and that of two great ladies at daggers drawn over their seat at some function or other?--all simply scrambling for something they haven't got. 
 Prestwich has certainly written the best I've read on Edward I to date. However, there were sections where he goes a little deeper into legal tangents than would normally interest me. The Yale series is very promising  and well worth reading. Saul's Richard II in this series was the best, but  Edward I will give a good, unbiased view of this king who is difficult not  to be biased about 
 Enjoyable book, almost couldn't put it down!  Very enjoyable read. I am looking forward to reading S 5 Minutes Ago!  
 How Few Remain is a pure alternative history book as opposed to alternative history blended with science fiction as in Guns of the South.  Turtledove assumes that several plausible events happened in the original Civil War, which allowed the Confederacy to win.  How Few Remain takes place twenty years after the Civil War.  The Confederacy buys Northern Mexico to enable the Confederate States of America to extend from coast to coast.  This touches off a second war between the United States of America and The Confederate States of America.  The Confederates are joined in the war by their allies England and France.  Turtledove follows the action by jumping around the country to various locales of the confrontation.  Real and imagined historical figures are woven into the story.  The action mainly focuses around:   General "Stonewall" Jackson defending the Yankee advance against Louisville   Jeb Stuart's cavalry (and camelry) launching attacks against the New Mexico territory from former Mexican provinces   Teddy Roosevelt defending Montana from a British invasion launched through Canada   Abraham Lincoln leading socialist rallies   Frederick Douglass' exploits as a war correspondent   Can the United States redeem themselves from the disgraceful loss of the first Civil War?  Will the residents of Montana end up speaking with a British accent?  Will Lincoln incite a Marxist revolt in Utah?  I couldn't wait to find out.  Turtledove weaves a fascinating "what if" scenario that is based on good research of the original Civil War.  Anyone with an interest in the Civil War should find this book fascinating.  At first I found the flow of the book slightly annoying since it keeps jumping from place to place to follow the main characters.  However, once I got used to Turtledove's style, the book flowed fairly well.  But be forewarned...if you don't remember your Civil War history, this book will leave you scratching your head wondering what was going on.  Either refresh your memory on the actual Civil War or give this book a pass.  
 I bought this book for my husband who is a huge Lord of the Rings fan.  He then said, "This is the best anniversary edition I've ever seen."  The book is extremely well made and absolutely beautiful 
 A truly sensational cookbook that stimulates all of your gustatory senses.   A truly fabulous book for those who want to REALLY GET TO KNOW Spain through your stomach ;)    We always find good recommendations in the reader's comments.  So, I will share one with you.  One of our favorite NEW FINDS is the ChezEvaristo in Pamplona, Navarra, Spain. They treated us very well and the seafood they served was to die for.  The "tapas," or finger foods, are mouthwatering, especially the seafood.  The decor is beautiful, yet quaint. It is located in Pamplona's downtown on the world renowned street where the bulls run loose to kick off Spain's annual bull fighting season. Enjoy your Sangria and tapas in the comfort of this quaint and comfortable restaurant if you opt out of trying to literally run with the bulls running loose on the street. [The restaurant has a webpage for more info  www.chezevaristo.com]  Es recomendable a conocer la comida española y come las deliciosas tapas españolas. Mi favorito lugar es el Chezevaristo en Pamplona, España.  Se encuentra en el centro de Pamplona a 1 min de la Plaza del Castillo y a 3 de la Plaza del Ayuntamiento. En plena calle Estafeta, famosa por se la calle por la que discurre el famoso Encierro. Ver su pagina web www.chezevaristo.com 
 If you can only get one book on teaching writing using the Writer's Workshop model let it be this one. It's detailed, full of practical tips, but most important--you will be INSPIRED! I immediately started my own writer's notebook after I read this book. One caveat...this is not a book that you can pick up on Sunday night because you want to start the program on Monday morning. This book is written to be read and re-read, pondered and poured over. That having been said, this is NOT just a book of theory, it thoroughly and lovingly explains all the nuts-and-bolts of the workshop 
 Buddha Boy review  Buddha Boy by Kathe Koja is a realistic fiction story of a religious young boy named Jinsen, who is new at Rucher High School.  The kids make fun of him for his dragon t-shirts and peaceful ways.  Especially McManus, a popular hot-shot that likes to put others down.  McManus does things like shoving Jinsen into lockers and jamming Jinsens locker.  Justin, another student at Rucher High became friends with Jinsen despite the names other people were calling him.  Justin's father is an artist and does not visit Justin very often.  Jinsen just happens to be the best artist in the school.  This draws Justin to Jinsen.  Can Jinsen overcome what other people think and sketch his way to the top?  You will have to find out yourself.   I would have to give this book a 4.5 out of 5 star rating.  I enjoyed this book so much because of the simple writing style that was easy to follow yet effective to tell the story.  This author really puts you in the shoes of Justin who is becoming friends with Jinsen.  One thing that I didn't like about this book is the fact that it was a mere 117 pages which really turned me off when I saw this book.  I really wish I could have kept on reading this book.  I believe that you will love the story of Justin and Jinsen, 2 boys trying to make their way at Rucher High School.   
 Kurosawa and Noh do Macbeth with so much less language (not that I do not like Shakespeare's poetry) and so much more physical expression, that I doubt that I will not be able to read the play again without imagining Mifune as I read Will.  
 One, and only One, reviewer gave this album two stars.  My advice:  read ALL the reviews printed here.  You will get the idea and I have nothing further to add to their critiques.  But with one exception.  As far as Christians having their brains sucked out through their noses, you who wrote that are demonstrating your total lack of integrity and artistic worth.  I don't go to church, I smoke, drink moderately, cuss, and sometimes practice irreverance that shames me.  However, I love God/Allah/The Great Spirit/Jehovah and, like Dylan, become rabid when I see religious intolerances.  Not all Christians are Pat Robertson any more than all Muslims are Osama Bin Laden.  Give Bob (and God) a break son!  We (and Bob) are all aspiring to a higher truth in whatever form that may come to us.  This is the nature of art.  If you love surrealism but are vehemently anti-drug, would you dismiss Salvadore Dali as NOT ART because he was an LSD zealot?  I think people who are so narrow minded they cannot see straight are the ones who have had their brains sucked out through their noses!  Bob Dylan set his beliefs in motion in his art.  This IS what art is all about.  Van Gogh was PASSIONATE and DEDICATED to his beliefs and painted with his soul.  Steinbeck and Hemingway wrote with their souls.  Dylan composes with his soul.  He is an artist whose expression changes with his soul's direction in much the same manner that Picasso's artistic style drastically changed during his life more than 4 times!  These songs are NOT childish, they are NOT a religious slap in the face, and they are certainly NOT demeaning to anyone who appreciates good art in music.  How many times did Joni Mitchell change her style of music?  Did the critics trash her at any bus stop?  Heck No!  So why did they trash Bob during this period?  Because it is and always has been vogue to trash anything having even a remote resemblance to being Christian or even religious in any way shape or form.  That is too bad, because the critics seem to not be getting the message.  An artist paints what is inside them.  This album has terrific music.  If you liked Blood On The Tracks, and Desire, you will love this one.  It's a natural progression from them.  Buy it, if you don't like it, send me hate-mail.  If you just cannot abide by anything even resembling Christianity then I suppose you'd better not buy it, you've been "warned" by just about every review here, eh?  Oh and by the way, if you do feel that way, throw your money away because it says "In God We Trust" on it.  In fact, you can give to me!  Oh and one last thing, if you can't abide by this albums "preachiness" you better stay away from the new cd Modern Times because it's loaded with an old man's religous reflections, and hey what's up with that?  The critics are falling all over themselves for Modern Times!  It's Dylan's new masterpiece don't you know?  People are so fickle.. 
 If you like yoga to be more strenuous, this book may be for you. It shows a series of ashtanga exercises in words and pictures. The poses are so well explained that you won't need an instructor. Unfortunately, many are out of my reach, although I have been practicing yoga for two years. I simply pick out the ones I like and leave the rest for contortionists. But if you either start young or you have a background of gymnastics or ballet, this book will teach you ashtanga yoga at its best.   Unlike other forms of yoga, ashtanga includes flowing poses, a series of individual poses that are stringed together so that you flow from one into the other. Those are great exercises for developing balance, rhythm and strength.  The author places great emphasis on breathing and explains clearly how to breathe at each step. This is very useful and can be transferred to other yoga exercises as well. Another plus: The book focuses on physical exercise and does not go into nutrition or lifestyle. 
 I am a 40D and it is very difficult to find a bra that lifts, is comfortable and the straps will stay on all day. My search is over. This bra stayed on my shoulders all day!!! This has never happened to me before. Wonderful product, seamless and comfortable. Please don't hesitate to buy 
 This book is exactly what I have come to expect from Colin Mook and O'Reilly. It is a very well written, quality and informative tutorial on OOP with AS 2.0. This book goes great with Mr. Moock's earlier book; "ActionScript for Flash MX, TGD". I have come to cherish O'Reilly as a publisher and this book just reaffirms my complete trust that they put out some very good books. 
 My mother had me choose a book to read of school , and of the books we had this sounded like the best. I was a little skeptical at first, but as soon as I started reading, I couldn't put it down! Every time something new happened, I would stop and announce to Mom why this part of the book was exciting, and I just couldn't thank her enough! One night I read from 10:30 to midnight. I just couln't get enough of Buran and her prince, Mahmud. If I had a favorite book before, it was nothing compared to Seven Daughters and Seven Sons. Thank you, Barbara Cohen and Bahija Lovejoy 
 This is a very good book to read on shotguns and shooting. Mr. McIntosh is an excellent writer. His style of mixing technique with short stories and antidotes made for a pleasant, educational and entertaining read. Add this book to your library 
 Luckily my wife knew this book as I had never heard of it.  At first I was concerned about the story line as I read it (thinking of what goes on in Bull fights and my little girl) but the story is masterful written and the pictures are well done as to eliminate concern.  Ferdinand is a gentle bull that loves to smell flowers under a tree rather then play, play bump heads, and dream of being in the bull fights in Madrid.   One day a group comes looking for the biggest toughest bull they can find.  Ferdinand was going to do his usual thing of sitting under a tree and smelling flowers but he sits on a Bee.   He gets stung and charges around like crazy and so they pick him.  My girl doesn't like bees as she was stung by one.   However, the look on Ferdinand's face made it funny for her.  Ferdinand goes to the fights and simply sits in the middle of the ring and  smells the scent from the flowers in women's hair.  Nothing will make him fight and he angers, depresses and makes the matadors cry since they can't show off.  He is returned to his field and quickly returns to sitting under his tree and smelling the flowers.  It's a sweet story and I think I will be reading it for a long time.  
 my friend saw them, and told me to see them, so i saw them, and they put on an amazing show that just gets everyone into it, and thier cd does too... it is worth every penny... hell its worth more than they sell it for. this cd is now one of my top favorite cds in my collection. i just saw them at warped tour and they are coming here again next week and im gonna see them again. but i love this ep and i think if u are looking at this then u should buy it. i think my favorite song is "it's too bad" but they are all good and i think that u will love this ep if u get it. so do ur self a favor and get it.. 
 I used to read Drummer Hoff to my little girls in the late 1960's and  early 1970's, at the height of the antiwar movement.  I am saddened by the reviews that fail to find the message in this fine little book.  It was published in 1967, and is such an obvious antiwar book that I can only feel the reviewers have little sense of history.  The idyllic pastoral environment with little birds and flowers is blown to pieces at the end as the giant cannon, "Sultan," explodes.  It is a tale of the self-destructive savagery of war.  My little girls are now grown, about to have their own children, and I am giving Drummer Hoff to them, so their own antiwar instincts can be made vivid to their children in a language that all will find accessible and delightful 
 If you are studing for the CSCS exam this is your book.  And I should stress this is the ONLY review material that you need, the other "review" materials are a waste of time and money.  This book does an excelent job preparing you for the test--read the chapters take the tests at the end of the chapters and you should pass with flying colors.  As a side note, yes this book is rather dry, however there is NO other book that covers the entire relm of strength training as well as this book--yes, there are better speciality books than this one and yes there are books that are easier to understand--but as far as covering all the bases, this is the best I've found.  It also has good color pictures--as opposed to Designing Resistance Training Programs 
 For those looking for a step-by-step book for securing your Windows XP box, you have come to the wrong place. This is a textbook covering security fundamentals from mathematical concepts, like cyphers and encryption, to the analysis of intrusions, viruses and worms through to policy aspects. About as concrete as it gets in terms of implementation comes in the second to last chapter on securing the internals of a C program.  This book provides an excellent grounding in the fundamentals of security. A must have for anyone studying security, or for those looking for a deeper understanding of IT security fundamentals 
 Upon reading the spiritual autobiography of Thomas Merton, the immediate details of his life that boldly jutted out and painted the overall portrait of the man was his controlled yet cyclonic whirlwind of pell-mell inconsistency and the overall amorphousness of his ever evolving life up into manhood.  Thomas Merton's life seemed to be the never-ending quest for the ultimate truth, and there were many byways that he chose in order to obtain that: literature, academia, writing, traveling, communism, rollicking around with friends and girlfriends in playful mirth, all the way down the gamut. The veneer that he presents, as illustrated in the autobiography, seemed to be one of gradual and acute worldly dissatisfaction, a man who had an internal "been there done that" mentality and who could never be really satiated, despite his intellectual and Herculean efforts. And Merton was, no doubt about it, a brilliant man, but he never seemed to have the appropriate venue for all that he was eternally endowed with. Though he was young and had so much going for him in a manner realtional to the world, it could not soothe the cut of his injured relationship to the outer world in which he occupied. It was as though he was a reluctant participator in a mysterious game where Love was the backdrop, and his inner tumultuousness gradually conformed to the Will, and it is the latter aspect that makes the story so fasciniting, because it encompasses the supernatural, the pragmatic, the logical, the Divine, all meshed together in a ball of wax.   What makes the Seven Storey Mountain so gripping is that the reader follows Thomas Merton through his various escapades of self-absorption down to his conversion and then on down to his monastic vocation. But with each step, the discernment process is intricately exposed in all its minute details, as well as its various joys and sufferings. He was a man who could write beautiful English yet could never get published. He was a man who was philosophically deep yet could not really apply that depth to anything concrete. He was passionate in his seriousness yet that made him somewhat of an outsider, but it was not until he stopped fighting God that things started to happen, and he saw the Divine tests for exactly what they were: Gifts. But it takes a long time to come to that understanding and it is not always easily accepted. Like Merton, one just has to run him or herself ragged with fighting the duality of the internal and external to come to that point, and the autobiography makes it known that it is not always a joy to have to hit the basest level of yourself to understand what you really are.  Overall, the work was quite nice to read, if not a tad bit preachy at times and other times overly sanctimonious, but again, that can be attributed to the newness of Merton's calling, for he entered Gethsemani in 1942, and the partially approved text of the Seven Storey Mountain was approved in 1946, finally being published in 1948. But I thought it was a moving read that did affect my senses, and it will yours as well.    
 I really liked the fact that this was in a text format with questions as well as answers provided.  The title says "Course" and I believe that is exactly what it is.  It provides a lot of detail in such a short span of just over 200 pages.  The question and answer format really helps to cement the content.  As other reviewers have indicated, there was a lot of page turning back and forth to find the right chart to go with the right question but there are plenty of charts to support the material provided.  I found it was just what I was looking for as a formal introduction to candlesticks from someone definitely in the know.    Happy trading! 
 Charlaine Harris is addictive-watch out.  You start timidly with one and before you know it, you have finished her last book and are boo hooing that it will be forever before she finishes another one.  Great book, really believable characters.  It was one of the most delightful reads I have had in a long time 
 My uncle had given me a copy last Christmas.  We discussed the book, and its impact upon our lives, fairly often.  When he was hospitalized late this year with what turned out to be fatal colon cancer, he insisted upon having his copy with him in the hospital.  When you read Breakfast at the Victory, you'll understand why.  Its one of those once-in-a-decade books that affect you for the rest of your life 
 WELL I LOVE THE BEATLES WHOM I ALWAYS THOUGHT WERE THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD.EACH AND EVERY SONG ON THIS COMPILATION IS GREAT.SO BUY IT TODAY.THE BEATLES ROCK,GREEN DAY SUCKS 
 Ann M. Martin also produces a lovely holiday story for advanced elementary to middle school readers: this, ON CHRISTMAS EVE telling of Tess, who believes in magic and is determined to view the 'real Santa', not the department-store fake. Her holiday wish is for a friend - and her faith results in a rare holiday indeed in this story of love and magic. 
 Great value 2 cd disc set cut in the early 1980's & remastered the sound of the Royal Marines Band is nothing short of terrific. Judging by the sound would not be surprised for this to be a combined double RM band. These 1st chair players give Sousa's great marches that extra kick that takes the "March Kings" music to that higher level. By the center quick march!!! 
 Recently bought Il Divo album.  If you like Modern Opera and 4 fabulous voices that lift you up, then this album is for you. I am enjoying it everyday 
 One of the greatest books about Gypsies Ive ever read. Fraser is skilful historian with necessary distance from controversial theme of his analysis. Only if youre looking for insight of individuals, you wont be satisfied 
 Here's what my reviewer Kris had to say for DJfix.com/Raves.com:   From classic true jazz to jazz-infuenced futurisms, this two disc set brings us "The History" and "The Present" of jazz. Helping to filter out some worthy tracks from jazz's extensive history is Gilles Peterson, whose selections on "The History" disc include Rashaan Roland Kirk's "Spirits Up Above," a kind of funky sung jazz band number that halfway makes me think of the "Hair" musical; lonely, rainy night brass jazz with delicious vocals both male and female on Charles Mingus' "Moves"; the jazz classicism of Mark Murphy's "My Favorite Things," putting to shame Julie Andrew's version; the hip smoothness of John coltrane on "Equinox." Others on disc one include Roy Haynes, Randy Weston, Art Blakely, The Jazz Crusaders, Eric Dolphy and Bill Evans. The second disc explores more modernistic modes, touching on music that may not seem like jazz - in some cases - but is definitely endowed with roots in jazz. Examine the sexy soul jazz-it-up of Nikki O's "Butterflies" or the funktified kickalong of "Mother of the Future" by Bembe Segue. You can immerse yourself in the dark, almost foreboding sound of Two Banks of Four performing "Two Miles Before Dawn." You can even enter electronic chillout territory with "At Les" by the Innerzone Orchestra. Others on this disc are 4 Hero, The Matthew Herbert Big Band feat. Jamie Lidell, Pavel Kostiuk feat. Vanessa Freeman, Rima feat. Ian O'Brien, Carlo Fashion and Hedvig Hanson. These "Present" selections were made by the Jazzanova collective. All told this is a wonderful exploration of jazz and jazz offshoots, boasting an eclectic (for sure) batch of tracks, a selection of smart, alluring music to drift through for a while. 
 A few months ago, I started dating a very successful, attractive, and intelligent girl who revealed very early on our relationship that she was the victim of sexual abuse. Although she didn't provide details and I didn't pressure her for details, I had no idea the impact this could have on someone and as I got to know her better and see her more often, we actually started getting farther apart emotionally. This really confused and upset me because I was in love with her and I really wanted to be close to her. As a result, I began to push her to be closer emotionally and to share her feelings with me more often.  Within a few weeks, she broke-up with me because I think of the pressure I applied to be close, among many other things that only now make so much sense. We remain, however, today as friends.  After we broke up, I came across "Invisible Girls" and read it cover to cover twice. As I read the book, so many things that happened in our relationship and some of my friend's characteristics were now so understandable. I wish that I had read this book as soon as she told me her story as I could have been so much more understanding and more supportive toward her than I was.  For example, each time that she pushed me away, I would try to talk to her about it and try to get her to share her feelings with me, but in reality I was actually just pushing her away. After I read this book, I learned that such people really don't want to push people away but that is what they have done for years to protect themselves and it shouldn't be taken personally. I should have been more patient and understanding to my friend during these times.   I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the affects that sexual abuse has on people, and to hear what steps individuals can take to recover, overcome and move forward confidently in their lives as independent people. It has given me the perspective and understanding to be unconditionally supportive, kind, loving, gentle and understanding toward my friend, which is the very least that my awesome friend should expect from anyone in her life.  This really is a great book.    
 Without question this is one of the most incisive books written about living and working with Asians, especially the Chinese and Japanese.  Put this together with some knowledge of Group Dynamics and you will have two very powerful tools to engage in business with Asians 
 This CD contains seldom heard songs, radio commercials, and even a clip from FDR's famous "Day of Infamy" speech.  A wonderful time capsule of WWII in the Pacific, beginning with Pearl Harbor. The country hit by the Sons of the Pioneers about the battle of Iwo Jima is almost never seen in the usual big-band only type of compilations. A fitting finish to the CD with the song, "Let's Remember Pearl Harbor", rounds off the tribute.  Overall, a great collection of rare recordings that sum up the era 
 This system was very easy to set up and came with clear, concise instructions for use.  The sound is full and satisfying.  My only reservations are; using the unit with a Roady XT requires an adapter (nicely included) which seems to get fairly hot after prolonged use, and the volume control is a knob on the front which feels a bit flimsy.  I will probably end up buying the Roady XT remote so that I don't have to deal with turning the knob all the time.  I bought this unit for it's design and sound quality, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase 
 I have to say that Animal Liberation by Peter Singer is one of my all time favorite books.  It is amazingly well researched and thorough: after reading it I think most people will have little doubt that Singer is a genius.  The work was instrumental in beginning the Animal Rights movement.  It explores animal testing and the meat industry through the lense of the suffering of animals.  
 With the precision of a surgeon and the eloquence of Jesus, John Spong's insight removes the cancerous tumor threatening to consume Scripture to reveal the Good News of Love. Praise is to God, Allah, or whatever you deem to call Him. If you are a freethinking, people-loving, faith-filled person, then this book is a must. 
 I am a nurse, and I recommend this book to almost everyone.  It is written at a decent level - not dumbed down, but not too technical.  Information is current, helpful and practical.  For less than 25 bucks, it is a bargain!  Family and friends will benefit as well as people with cancer 
 This is a good game with plenty of re-play value.  The travel addition is small and light and helps with long plane trips.  I could quibble... the quality of the unit isn't great - it can be hard to get the pieces out after a game and the little pieces are small and hard to handle and can get lost.  But why quibble?  It's small and light and cheap and FUN 
 The Healthy Lunchbox provides a solid basis for parents to provide their children with healthy lunches that pack up quickly and easily.  The book is divided into four parts: Part One, "Get Ready!", outlines the nutrional needs of kids; Part Two, "Get Set!", helps parents with the logistics of packing lunches (how to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold, menu suggestions, ideas on how to get your children to eat what you pack, not trade it away, alternatives to junk food, etc.); Part Three, "Go!", where all the recipes are housed; and Part Four, "More Food for Thought," where the authors give parents further resources.   I read the first two parts (after looking at all the recipes!) and the information was solid and written in a conversational tone. My reason for buying the book, of course, was the recipes and I was not disappointed. There was a wide variety of foods (from your standard english muffin pizza to japanese style california rolls) presented under three headings: Sandwiches, Salads, Soups, Casseroles, and Other Main Dishes; Fruit and Veggie Side Dishes and Snacks; and Snacks and Desserts. As promised, the recipes are quick and easy, and each has its own nutrional index covering calories, total fat (further broken down into saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat and monunsaturated fat), cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates (further broken down into dietary fiber and sugars), protein, and exchanges. Serving size, total servings, prep time and cook time are also included. Indeed, this book is very comprehensive.  Additionally, the recipes in this book can appeal to adults and children alike, so that weekend lunches and adult lunchboxes can benefit, too. My particular favorite is the Turkey Lurkey Jerky - it's easy (although time-intensive) and tasty and now I can make my husband's favorite snack without any preservatives or other nasties. In fact, the first batch I made was eaten the same day (much to my chagrin)! This recipe alone was worth the cost of the book to me 
 Like Andrew Hallock, it did not escape my notice that all the political references were Republicans or conservatives, and I've grown weary of that bent in academia and would have preferred a more balanced look at politics.    Nonetheless, this book was hugely enjoyable for me.  While I bought it for a class, I would have read it just for a fun.  But then, I'm kind of stickler for critical thinking anyway.  Fellow students hated the class and had a hard time with it.    IMO, critical thinking skills are woefully lacking in today's world and if I were king, this book would be required reading for everyone.  
 I bought this cookbook a few years ago, read through it, fixed a couple of cookie and muffin recipes, then put it away. Recently I got it out again and cooked some entrees and they were incredible! I am stuffed at the moment from Eggplant Cassarole. It was so good I nearly couldn't stop eating. Last week we had red beans and rice, the week before Black-eyed Chicken. The recipes take a little more time because of the ingredients (dried beans, rice, etc.) but not a lot of work. But oh the taste -- it's totally worth it! My husband has raved about his leftovers lately. Highly recommended. 
 Steven Levy, author of Hackers, reprises his examination of the high-tech industry with a close-up on the making of the Macintosh.  Levy retells the story of the Macintosh's genesis, its influence from research at Xerox PARC, the ill-fated Apple Lisa and finally its painful birth.  This is not a classic business book and really doesn't cover the rise and fall of Apple or it's CEOs in any great detail.  Instead this is a more intimate story of the people who helped make the Macintosh.  If you liked "Soul of a New Machine" you'll love this book 
 Very pleased with this set.  In an age where you can quite easily pay $20 for a new, single-disc release of most movies, which come with no insert other than a one-sheet "Buy more DVDs from this company"...it's refreshing to pay less than $20 for two well-made discs and a very nice, informative booklet.  As a fan of Hertzfeldt, Plympton and Judge, I bought this on the strength of them, but am finding a lot more that I like on here as well.  Can't wait to catch the road show when it comes to the my area.  Word of warning, most people who come to this page will already know but, some of these cartoons are rather strange.  Just be forewarned, if you try to put this on in mixed company, or for people who aren't really into animation other than Family Guy and The Simpsons, I doubt they will run screaming - but they're probably going to give you some strange looks.  That's one of the reasons I love them - but, it might not be a lot of people's cup of tea.  And like JONG said, for 67 cents a short, you really can't beat giving it a shot 
 Nora Roberts' greatest talent is in creating a realistic sense of place for the reader.  She is better than almost all other present-day writers in this area.  In the "In the Garden" trilogy, she takes us to a large plant nursery outside Memphis and makes it so that we can see the mansion, the gardens, carriage house, indeed, the entire locale.  One almost feels that he has been there.  Roberts creates the same realism in her other novels--Alaska, an island off New England, the Louisiana Bayous, etc.  I would add as an aside that gardens are a recurring theme in Ms. Roberts' works, even in frigid  "Northern Lights."  Her characters are generally engaging, but she throws in one in "In the Garden" who is, for lack of a better term, annoying.  The genealogist is supposed to be a "hottie," attracted to Ros, the principle character in the middle book, "Black Rose."  But the genealogist/professor is pedantic one moment, as he carefully explains for the ignorant, and sappy the next as he romances his employer, Ros.  A somewhat similar character appears in the Three Sisters Island trilogy by Ms. Roberts:  a "scientist" who is investigating witches by using vaguely described technical instruments.  The genealogist and quasi-scientist could have been of some other occupation and the books would have been better.  I can accept witches and ghosts in fiction.  They are part of a long literary tradition, from Shakespeare to J.K. Rowling.  The failing is when a writer tries to look at ghosts and witches with some modern-scientific and logical perspective and thus destroys the illusion.  The only exception is when this is done humorously, as in "Ghostbusters," and even then the results are questionable and silly.  The plots are OK in all Ms. Roberts' books--nothing spectacular--just OK.  She throws in sex scenes, generally two per novel.  They are warm and gauzy sex scenes, lacking in specifics such as one came to accept in old movies.  I suppose these episodes are necessary for some readers, but I don't believe the gratuitous bedroom (or in one case, the lawn} scenes add anything worthwhile.  Closer editing would help in numerous cases.  Surprising errors occur.  The Atlanta Braves, for example, do not play the Seattle Mariners--ever.  Celiac disease was unknown in Ros' grandfather's infancy.  College basketball players cannot be drafted 10th in the first round by the Boston Celtics and still be playing college ball.  Etc.  Some may consider these niggling points, but they are the sort of thing that can puncture the balloon of reality for a reader.  Despite the imperfections, the books are fine examples of escapist literature.  I would not call them "chic lit."  The term itself is somehow offensive.  Fiction is either good or bad or somewhere in between.  To defend a book's shortcomings by saying, "Well, it was written for women" is saying, "Well, it may be a bad book but women have no taste."  I cannot accept that.  Nora Roberts' books are not perfect.  Few novels are.  But the atmosphere alone is sufficient to bring me to read more by this writer 
 Dude, nobody rocks it like the Hoff! as hard as it may be to believem his musical talents actually equal-maybe even surpass-his skills as a thespian!   I was first exposed to the Hoff's amazing vocal talents when he guest starred on the classic series, KIDS, incororated. Imagine how exciting it was for a young tyke to see Knight Rider singing on saturday morning TV! y'know, Knight Rider was probably the greatest series ever about a talking car, but they really dropped the ball by not having the Hoff sing more. maybe even a duet of the Hoff and KITT of ebony and ivory. Knight Rider would've been like 37 bajillion times awesomer if it was a musical like cop rock. cop rock rules!  but i'm not reviewing cop rock, I'm reviewing the Hoff's awesome retrospective album, which is a great overview of the Hoff's career, altho obviously, you're going yourself a disservice to not buy the original albums; a lot of great stuff there. But if you want an album that rocks the house, this is the one for you.  Dude, I hope when they do the movie of Knight Rider it's a musical. that'd be the awesomest movie eve 
 Joe Gaziano from Chicago, Illinois , November 24, 1998   An excellent book that explains human/animal relations Unnatural Order establishes Jim Mason as one of the important intellectuals of the Animal Rights Movement. Mason  provides a thoughtful and readable analysis of the relationship of people  to animals throughout history. In this book Mason demonstrates how the  changes in animal/people relationships have, over time, dramatically  altered human existence. In much of the early history of humanity people  lived in harmony with animals. Nature was viewed as containing fellow  creatures with many of the same characteristics as people. Animals were  revered and respeced. The move to an agricultural society where increasing  numbers of animals became food resulted in a shift of consciousness. The  culture became one in which humans were seen as dominant over and superior  to animals. Humans increasingly separated themselves from nature and the  animals, often denying their own animal nature. The result is a human  culture divorced from nature and suffering from all the ill effects that  such a society produces. Mason's book should be read by every vegetarian  and animal rights advocate. It is sure to be a classic in the field 
 I found this book to be very illuminating in light of what I do (interaction design) and the books I have read recently on the latest in computational neuroeconomics, maninstream pattern recognotion theory, interaction design, visual design, industrial design, computer engineering, new marketing theory, and information design around complex systems. In fact, this book is almost a stake in the ground on how the manufacturing process, invention, and branding created the artifacts in our environment. Better than the Industrial Desig books I read 10 years ago. I think we would call these "case studies" and "use cases" in modern terminology. I mention all the fields above because every single one of them have an exact doppelganger in the past.  This book is a brilliant look at process and can be used as a research tool when looking at why something like the iPod caught on and why almost everything that has been developed at MIT in  recent history (except eInk) has never gained a foothold in popular American culture. In the face of the rise of "everyware" computing, it's adoption in places like Korea and Japan, and only limited use by the rich for personal security in the US, I would say this is a must read for contemporary designers, no matter what depth of complexity their task at hand. This book predates the web, making it very enlightening in light of user-centered design in recent years.   This book looks at the relationship of genius design, corporate R+D, pop culture, the feedback loop for product innovation, and the adoption of standards around SIMPLE things. This means these case studies can be used to analyse the failures (and how failure  breeds innovation, not "form follows function") of our complex information economy and embedded systems. Society has gone through it all before. And as projects become increasingly team based and open sourced (like Stanford's new d.school), just about anyone can find value in this book based within this context 
 If you are looking for a book that goes into detail about the human condition and what a life of practice is in relationship to it, one of Ezra's previous books would be more appropriate.  If you are looking for something that can instantaneously cut through the general sleep that is pervasive in day-to-day living, if used wisely, this book offers a hand.  A place in my daily life where I tend to get consumed in the narrow tunnel of thinking is in relationship to finances.  When balancing the checkbook I usually end up in a ball of constricted tightness and am completely asleep in my thinking. After purchasing a copy of this book I took one of the aphorisms and taped it to my computer where I do my finances.  "You'll never be free from discomfort and fear, yet liberation comes from not needing to be free from them.", was gazing down at me throughout the process.  Every few minutes I would take a look at the phrase and use it as a reminder to work with the experience rather than get completely caught in my usual mechanical way.  Staying with the body, the breath, the sounds, observing the thoughts and this place, which usually leads to complete sleep, and suffering was just an interesting, even enjoyable experience.  I recommend this book without reservation for anyone looking for a tool that can assist in the difficult process of a life of practice.  
 One of the most robust and active publishing sectors is that of business books (especially in the areas of corporate management and product marketing nationally and internationally). Tom Gorman (author of more than a dozen business books), specifically intends Writing The Break Through Business Book to be a solid guide to getting a business book written and published. Gorman takes the aspiring business book writer from concept to development, to negotiation, and covers business aspects of getting business books written, published, and marketed. An astutely organized, matter-of-fact resource covering everything from whether one should hire a PR firm or a book publicist, to developing an idea in one sentence, to creating a "time budget" in accordance with one's publishing schedule and so much more, Writing The Break Through Business Book is recommended as being comprehensive, practical, and definitive 
 Considering this collection was written in the late 30's and early 40's, and was, in fact, the first volume of Heinlein's now-famous Future History, it has actually held up quite well throughout the ensuing years. However, some of the events in the stories have been inevitably dated. It is still well worth reading, though. Heinlein's quick-paced writing style and caustic wit, not to mention lovable characters, always make his stories worth reading, regardless of when they were released. Also, the stories here, for the most part, focus not on the scientific aspects of the technologies in question, but rather the sociological and political sides of them. This is what Heinlein brought to science fiction. He showed us that the key ingredient in good science fiction is story and characters, not the technology being showcased; and by focusing his stories on the characters within and their aspects, his stories are usually just as readable now as the day they were released, even if some of their inherent technology has been dated by subsequent advances in science. Aside from being the first volume in the Future History series, this book is also notable for containing Heinlein's first ever published story, Life-Line. I'm sure you all know the premise-a man invents a machine that shows when people will die-but it is an interesting read if you haven't, and an epoch in the sense of it being the starting point in the career of one of science fiction's greatest writers. Blowups Happen and The Roads Must Roll (does this story remind anyone else of H.G. Well's The Sleeper Awakes?) both focus on technologies that are now fundamentally debunk in the modern day world, but they both focus instead on the people running these technologies (atomic factories and rolling roads respectively), and are an interesting look into sociology and psychology in science fiction. Let There Be Light is a short, decent piece. The Man Who Sold The Moon novella is the title and longest piece in this collection. It is almost totally devoid of actual science, as it has a rather unique, in fact, plotline for science fiction; but has as it's protagonist a seemingly rather crooked, dishonest character who is not particularly of the usually lovable Heinlein kind. It's still an entertaining story, as the writing style is excellent and fast-paced, and the dialogue is exquisite. Requiem features the same main character, and shows a seemingly total different side of him. This story is quite a bit different from most Heinlein, as it is primarily and emotion-based bit, reminding me of something more along the lines of Arthur C. Clarke. Interesting. Although not his best stories, the ones contained in this collection are worth reading, and a must, eventually, for any Heinlein fan 
 I am a 15 year old Catholic, and to be perfectly honest, I had never really read the Bible. Yes, I hear it in Mass and in Religious Education, but reading the Bible on my own was just plain difficult before I got the Catholic Youth Bible. It breaks down the different parts of the Bible so that I can understand the differences between the books of the Bible, so that I can choose what it is I want to read. It also explains passages, prayers, and stories that I never knew were so important. It has sections entitled "PRAY IT!" "STUDY IT!" and "LIVE IT!" that explain how to use the words from the Bible to live better lives as Catholics. I have a much better understanding of basic things such as the LORD'S PRAYER!!! Now, every Catholic knows the Lord's prayer by heart but how many of us teens truly understand what each line means and what we should be thinking about when we pray it?? When the prayer appears in the book of Matthew, the CYB picks apart the prayer line by line and explains what significance the prayer should have in our lives and what the lines mean.I would go on forever about how great this Bible is, and how much it has made me grow in spirituality and understanding of Biblical teachings, but we would be here all day. So just buy it yourself!!! It is worth EVERY penny!!! 
 I usually hate open ends, but in the case of La femme Nikita... it gives hop 
 Sometimes frustrations brought on because our politicians do not seem to understand the proper approach are the worst. Ralph Peters, being from the military, gives confidence that there are those in the right places who do understand terrorism and have the understanding to deal with the threat. A very clear and in-depth view of the world wide conflict with radical Islam and the correct approach 
 This DVD is a great benchmark of Coheed and Cambria's live show from the IKSSE3 tours. every song is a stellar performance and fun to watch. the audio quality is top notch and the camera work is just as good. The set was a bit short for the average Coheed headlinig show. The only problem is that no matter how good this DVD is it can never fully replicate the power, energy, and emotion of Co&Ca's live show. that would just be impossible. 
 Francine Gray has humanized Sade for us. The full description of his activities prior to his arrest,as given by Gray, confirms what Sade says of himself,"I am a libertine: I have conceived everything one can conceive in that genre, but I've surely not done all I've imagined and surely will never do it.." Sade was a visionery of cruel and convoluted sex. As regards the use of whips and Cat-'o'-nine tails and sodomy, he was only following the style of his contemporary aristocrats, a way of life which treated prostitites and the lower orders as captive booty, like the nubile black slave girls were treated in the South here till the Civil war.That way of life amongst the French Aristocracy .seems to have continued at least till the twenties of the last century- see Proust's portrayal of the proclivities of Baron Charlus in the last volume of his 'Remembrance of Things Past' ['In Search of last Time' in the recent Penguin Edition]. The description of the French Revolution by Madame Sade is an insider's account of the cataclysm. The black tid-bits about the leaders of the French Revolution, - Mirabeau [incest with his sister and writing erotica] and Danton, ['who read Justine  to masturbate']are quite revealing and also raise the question how it is that lechers and the morally defecient become leaders of rabble or are chosen as such by the rabble.Francine could have analysed what exactly was the attraction Sade had for women of all types- the intellectual Milli Rousset, the beautiful Anne Launay,his sister-in-law,  the uneducated Constance and others.The book is, on the whole, a great read.

 I am very satisfied with the whole experience in making this purchase.  It was delivered promptly and it has been working without an issue.  (I am using it as I type this). I had a professional install it so the fact that it did not come with instructions did not effect me.  There have been no surprises which is how things should go when making a purchase.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I gladly recommend this hard drive.  
 Just kidding, I don't know what I'm talking about. You should see this movie if you like:  1) Sex 2) Nudity 3) Hot babes 4) Mickey Rourke 5) Carre Otis 6) Mickey Rourke and Carre Otis going at it for real 7) Perfume commercials 8) Directors trying to make their softcore porn look like art by filming everything sensually and in slow motion, so the film appears to be arthouse and "visually stimulating" 9) Really, really, really bad dialogue 10) Lots of good banging and screwing without a plot 11) Mickey Rourke playing a total pimp (which is different than just Mickey Rourke - I mean, there's Mickey Rourke, and then there's Mickey Rourke the Pimp, which is even cooler)   And finally...   12) Hot female characters who wear glasses and carry around clipboards so the audience believes they are smart and successful businesswomen, when in fact they'd have a hard time calculating 1 + 1. (Also see: Alone in the Dark, Tara Reid's character; or Fantastic Four, Jessica Alba's.)  Highly recommended to the appropriate demographic.  I could kill myself for buying it. : 
 Even if you've only a passing interest or familiarity with old-time radio, this book is a must-have.  Full of fun quizzes, facts, and personally autographed pictures of radio's kings and queens of comedy, music, mystery and drama.  Everyone from Autry to Welles is in the book; I doubt you'll find a broader range of photos between a front and back cover.  "The Old-Time Radio Trivia Book" is splendidly done, and a pure delight.  The engaging trivia will leave long-time hobbyists and "newbies" alike saying, "Hey--I didn't know that!! 
 Ned's burst into the "alternative rock" scene with God Fodder, a brilliant debut effort, and one of the best in 1991.  "Grey Cell Green" and "Happy" were picked up by the local radio station, but the entire CD spills over with raw power.  A few of the songs on the CD (ex. "Kill Your Television") were taken from their earlier independent label issue, re-mixed here and blended to match the theme of the CD.  The energy of God Fodder is similar to Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory" - in fact, if you have never listened to Ned's, I would suggest this CD is like a mix between Nirvana and Linkin Park.  Unfortunately, Ned's Atomic Dustbin's later CDs never reach the level of intensity this album does, and have the feeling of overproduction, though they did manage a minor hit with "Been Sleeping Around".  
 Yes, the movie is juvenile.  Yes, the movie has some gross out moments.  Yes, the plot is basic.  But it is still fun!  I know that now that I am in my twenties, I am supposed to be more into classical films and literature, and modern smart and well written films and literature, and I am, but I also really like movies like this.  Films like Out Cold, Hackers, Grind , etc. all have that same magical combination of good times, outrageous skills or situations, comedy, adventure, and some deeper meaning.  Ultimately, these types of movies speak to the inner child in all of us, especially those of us that missed out on some of the light hearted teen years, due to some reason, or another.  Don't watch this movie to learn anything, or to expand your mind.  Watch it to have a good time, and get some great laughs 
 This book is a synopsis of easyt ways to evaluate and resolve conflicts in a business environment.  To the point 
 I was very touched by her concert which is this cd. she puts her soul and her spirit into all of her songs. One song almost had me in tears because she makes you feel her words. She is a must see in concert 
 I did enjoy this book a lot - it is well-written and is more like a diary about Robert Rodriguez. It tells the story of how he did with little money and ended up with a big hollywood success - a true american story 
 Ponder's book is, simply put - life-altering! This book was recommended to me by a psychic in 1986 because she was concerned about my constant focus on scarcity. I ignored her advice and continued a downward spiral into financial calamity. A year later, an astrologer friend insisted I read Ponder's book. I bought it and began pouring through the tome. It seemed overwhelming, I just didn't "get" it, but I kept reading and doing the affirmations. I took the book with me to the beach, to the library, on the commuter train to NY. I took the book with me to bed and rested it on the pillow beside me... hoping it would transform me during the night. After about 6 months, things started popping! After one year, my life changed dramatically. I had begun a new business in 1986 and wasn't attracting clients because my attitude was seriously in the crapper. I was focusing on not having any clients and continuing to manifest the same scenario. Ponder's style was ground-breaking. It's a huge book, sometimes daunting. If you're a slow reader like me or overwhelmed by books with more than 274 pages, just meditate first, close your eyes and open the book - wherever you "land" is where you're meant to read.  The material will always be timely, essential to reaching your goals and DYNAMICALLY magnetic for attracting exactly what you want. The practices have catapulted my life to a more successful strata, completely changed my thought patterns and behaviors. Highly recommended.  Pie Dumas Author & Life Coach   
 The story began with the B's having to live with a scardy cat of a woman, Aunt Josephine, who lost her husband a long time ago. She became in love with the Captain-Olaf. She dies by lachrymose leeches.  Plot: dull.  Suspence: present.  Entertainment: page-turner.  Hidden messages: a lot of good ones.  Mysteries: Lachrymose, passageways, Isaac Anwhistle.  Lachrymose means full of tears! 
 I scored this at a used "rock&roll shop for 20 bucks. Little did they no the value. This is totally awesome. The best part is the "assortedness" of it.  I was leary of sound quality, but it is  very good.  The version of Dizzy's "Manteca" is almost worth the  price.  The only person missing is Kenton, but as we know, he wasn't a  verve man.  BUy it, its worth it 
 I've been waiting for Roger Manning or Andy Sturmer from Jellyfish to put out a solo pop record since that band split in the early 90's.   While I've enjoyed Roger's other projects (especially Imperial Drag), THIS is the album I was waiting for... If you are a fan of Jellyfish and need a fix, this new release is worth the money (even at import prices) for the first track alone.      There are several stunners on this genre-hopping collection.   No wonder, considering that Manning was half the song-writing genius behind recordings like "Bellybutton" and "Spilt Milk", which defined the power pop genre fifteen years ago.   Congrats to you Roger - five stars all the way.   Please don't make me wait another fifteen years.. 
 This book is great!  I've never seen a book with so many styles of fences that would go with so many different types of architecture.  I also like how the material and illustrations are presented to allow the reader to easily see and compare the many different styles.  The first fence books I bought had a few nice photos with trees and flowers, but, the fences themselves were not that special.  I think it is much easier to see the fences for their own style and appearance the way they are presented in this book.  If you are looking for an abundance of design ideas, this book has no equal.   
 This is the 4th book I've read on the death cult called Islam.  Few cults are so dangerous and mind controlling.    This reviewer is a feminist.  It's amazing that Islam is given a pass by many fairly level headed American reporters.  An Islamic leader can issue a death sentence from his pulpit.  In America and Europe this is treated like a joke.  If the laws worked like it should then the mosques would be shut down under RICO.  All non-Muslim American better wake up to the threat.  Islam means to enslave us all.  Unbelievers will be put to death.  Womyn will be enslaved.  Please, look at Saudi Arabia!!!  The Muslims are quite open on how they want to enslave the human race in this cult of a religion.  The Constitution of the USA is not a suicide pact.  Islam is not compatible with democracy.  Americans should pass an ammendment to the Constitution allowing the regulation of the Muslims, expell their leaders, and double tax their followers.  This book is a good help on understanding what a danger Islam is to the democracy of America 
 I've been using Norton products for over 10 years. Each year they get more complex and more bulky. However, once the product is configured properly it tends to run well, detects intrusions and can  improve the health of just about any Windows based system. The online update process seems to work well. However if you change your hardware system configuration  you may have to re-activate the product.  The default (out-of-box) settings ALWAYS needs tweaking. The 2007 version is even more bloated than this version.   
 We purchased Nero in order to make voice recordings for other people.  The program has worked great.  It does what it says, it allows wonderful editing, so you can make sure what you record is clean.  We have also used it to record old cassettee tapes to CD.  The program automatically records the track making it an easy and smooth process.  We have been extremely happy with the low tech aspect, as we are not techy people.  Easy to use.  Does what it says it will do and a little more 
 A working class Olympic hockey star is looking to turn pro when he gets a body slam that costs him peripheral vision and the chance to play in the big leagues. Enter a frosty, WASPy figure skater from Connecticut who has every thing she wants except a partner. She doesn't like them, or they cannot stand her.  Her desperate Russian coach finds the hockey player who has the strength, stamina and spirit to skate with her, but he takes an instant dislike to her spoiled disposition and condescending temperament. The coach is convinced that both are partners who can bring home the elusive Olympic gold in figure-skating. The sparks fly.  The chemistry between D. B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly is instaneous. Their evolution to a skating pair is filled with competition between them at every turn. The on-screen tension between the two build as the Nationals and Olympics draw nearer. (It doesn't hurt that Moira Kelly is actually an accomplished skater.)  Sorry! You'll have to see the DVD because my narrative ends here. You will enjoy this drama-comedy of budding romance unless you don't have a romantic lace in your ice skates.  There is no language or skin, but it is a story for mid-teen to adult. This is light fare that is well-acted with a good script. It is thoroughly enjoyable, and worth the purchase.  My recommendations? Don't miss. Buy, don't sell.  
 A book loaded with memorable characters, conflicts, and dialogues. Okonkwo, with his tragic persona, remains a character anybody, irrespective of culture, can identify with. Chinua Achebe has really set the standards for the modern African novel with this book. The Igbo culture and the impact of Christianity in African are some of the elements that coalesce in making this book one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Thought-provoking, captivating,and informative. Simply brilliant!! Only a gifted storyteller can pen such a work of creative imagination.                                             --Dike Okoro                                               Milwaukee, Wisconsin                                               USA 
 This book is a collection of articles Prof. Knuth                   wrote about programming. He promoted a particular                   programming methodology called "literate                   programming", which weaves comments into codes and                   make them more readable and easier to maintain. This                   book was published in 1992, but Chapter 4, "Literate                   Programming", was originally published in 1984,                   which was an idea way ahead of his time (JavaDoc was                   first released in 1998, 12 years after the Knuth's                   article). Chapter one is Knuth's Turing Award                   lecture and still worth reading for his view on why                   programming is an art. I was wrongly impressed that                   Knuth is a very theoretical people and doesn't do                   much programming. As you would discover from these                   lecture and other articles in the book, he indeed                   did a lot of programming and arguably in a very                   clever and beautiful way, "the program of which I                   personally am most pleases and proud is a compiler                   I once wrote for a primitive minicomputer that had                   only 4096 words of memory, 16 bites per word                   (pg. 10)." The discussion about the "goto" statement                   in Chapter 3 is not relevant in today's programming                   and computer environment. The last few chapters are                   more like manuals of the WEB and CWEB programs (C                   version of WEB), which are the programs generating                   documents and source codes. These manuals may not                   interest readers unless they are well motivated to                   write program "literally." One gem should not be                   missed is is Chapter 10, "The Errors of TeX" (and                   the accompanying Chapter 11, "The Error Log of                   TeX). Seeing how Prof. Knuth meticulously documented                   all of his bugs in TeX is just amazing. Overall this                   book is more of historical value and for people who                   love Knuth and his work on literate programming 
 The bucket of playdoh is great because it comes with all the doodads that are fun with playdoh.  The best thing is that you can take it any where

 This active antenna works as advertised. I have used it  in the mountains and downtown and never lost the satellite signal 
 I had my first crush on Mickey Dolenz. This was the first album I ever bought at the ripe old age of 9. It is amazing to think I thought these guys were so awesome. Most of the songs are teeny bop as to be expected. But some of them actually do transend the generations and remain timeless classics but not all of them 
 I've said it before and I'll keep saying it--if you are not reading Tobias Wolff you are only cheating yourself.  The man simply does not write anything less than absolutely mesmerizing.  I assure you, that is not an exaggeration.  This latest work of Wolff's I've read is called In Pharaoh's Army.  It is a memoir offering us what lead to his taking part in the Vietnam War, his actual tour, and then the aftermath.  Now having read all of Wolff's work, I purposefully saved this one for last because I mistakenly believed I'd like it the least.    I loved this book.  Those of us born after the war have a notion of what Vietnam was like thanks to Hollywood movies, but Wolff gives us a totally different perspective, though no less horrific.  Wolff's memoir deals with the one thing nobody likes to talk about too much--fear.  He was afraid to go.  He was afraid while he was there.  And when he got back, he was afraid of what he'd become.  Wolff is not a weak man, you'll gather that from his recounts, he simply does not bother to hide the fact that he was counting down the minutes until he got home, and he just wanted to stay alive.  Each of Wolff's chapters are like mini-stories, and they each offer the hilarity, absurdity, and sometimes tragedy of his life during that time.  I was surprised at how much of the book is spent leading up to his deployment and then his eventual return.  I'd say only half of the book actually deals with his actual time in Vietnam.    As I've said, I've never experienced anything like this book and I completely recommend you read it if you are interested in either Wolff himself, the Vietnam War, or in the form and style of a masterly rendered memoir.  Please, do us both a favor--read something by Tobias Wolff 
 This is the perfect book for a beginner! It teaches you very basic techniques on cooking that everyone should know, such as how to make a sauce from burnt on meat juices. Its recipes also build on previous ones which makes memorization easier. What I loved most were the lessons on organization that will enable you to cook more efficiently.   In all, this is a great book to start anyone off as a cook. I made a sauce the other day by following the book's guidelines, rather than following a strict recipe and it turned out pretty good. The advice is great in that it gives you room to experiment without destroying your meal. In all, this is a great book to start anyone off as a cook. It's excellent! 
 This book has changed the way I think about the world and business. I never thought about the fact that when markets change the way we do business must change. The book calls us ' history's shock absorbers" as we live with the pain and opportunity that arises when one business model is dying and another is being born. The book is packed with insights, facts and theory that open the mind to a new way of doing business. It is ground breaking stuff. We never think about capitalism in our everyday business lives  but maybe we should have done . We are part of history and we can make more money and build better  corporations  if we really understood this. I would recommend this book to everyone. It is a great read and a map to a new future 
 This is worth a read even if you don't believe in astrology. It's accuracy is better than I've seen elsewhere and the tone makes it a fun read. It has sections devoted to both straight/gay/bi compatibility and by sex. Sextrology incorporates the spectrum when it comes to gender, identity and relationships. I loved it 
 The book is generally very good, but remember it, like the US auto club tour books, is geared toward the motorist.  There is precious little information about rail travel, etc., except for getting around Vienna.  Unfortunately it was just published before the Euro became Austria's only currency and all prices, etc. are still denominated in Schillings.  The index could also be more comprehensive.  Otherwise the book is excellent, and very detailed and I recommend it 
 I originally thought that the book was MORE on airgun operation, types, problems, etc. Of course it it a history of many airguns and their parent companies; to that end, it was very readable 
 The history of revolutions, at least the modern ones, have always been preceded by an animated struggle over radical/revolutionary ideas which more or less animated the progressive parties to push forward to what is an exception circumstance in the historic process, revolution-the going over from the old order to a new order by means of eliminating the old ruling class and installing a new one. Thus, the English Revolution of the 1600's found plenty of pamphleteers and publicists, especially among the Levelers (the secular democratic wing of the parliamentary forces) in the struggle to gain parliamentary ascendance. The French Revolution was inundated from many sources with ideas about which way society should be run leading up to the famous Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. And certainly the Russian Revolution, the most conscious effort at revolution known to history, was centrally determined by the titanic struggle by the various liberal and social-democratic parties over ideas. The book under review here takes its place in the debate over the role of such ideas in the American Revolution. Professor Wood is thus on fertile ground in tracing the history of the prevailing pre-revolutionary ideas which culminated in the Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution as well as the later struggle between the ideas of a society run as a democracy or as a republic which burst forth after the revolution.  Professor Wood is an eminent, if not the contemporary preeminent historian of the American Revolution, so what he has to say bears attention. His fundamental premise in this volume is that the struggle for ideas in the pre-revolutionary period determined the nature of the later, essentially parliamentary, struggles after independence was declared and the new frame of government was established. In short, he argues for a much more radical interpretation of the heretofore stodgy American Revolution known from childhood. His point that this revolution represented an important accrual in the struggle of the forces for enlightenment is something that militant leftists can appreciate whatever other disagreements with Professor Wood's political conclusions we might entertain.     Professor Wood makes two main points that bear notice. The first- while today rather obvious bears acknowledgement-that is the struggle from early on in the 1700's in the colonies to break from the role of subjects of the king to independent citizens of a republic. That premise was indeed progressive at the time and animated all movements from the late 1600's on. It is a struggle that continues today. The exception I take to Professor Wood's view is that while he is content with the general outline of current democratic practice I would argue that the road from citizen under capitalism to comrade under socialism is necessary to fulfill the still remaining democratic tasks of the American Revolution and the American Civil War.  Professor Wood's second premise is to note the divergence between the ideals of the leaders of the independence forces concerning the establishment of a government based on disinterested rule and the more plebian (and messy notion) that every cook could be a legislator. The gap between the leadership's (Washington, John Adams, Hamilton and the usual cast of suspects) high expectations of a Republic of Letters (their own personal republic) issuing forth from the revolution ultimately led to the demise of the elitist Federalist party and the rise of the rule of those claiming the interests of the plebian elements. In that fight militants support the plebian elements. That fight has never really been completed or expanded. Nevertheless Professor Wood's goal of defining the revolution as animated by more radical ideas that generally realized is an addition to our historic understanding of the American Revolution. Read on.  
 This DVD gave me more footage and knowledge of 2pac's life added to the many DVD's I saw and other CD's I heard 
  	This book is about a girl named Ruth. She returns to her home town after WWII expecting to find some of her family members. Instead she finds a guy named Saul who wants her to lead a group of 20 orphans to Palestine. She accepts and the adventure begins. By reading this book you learn about what children who were in the Holocaust had to go through and what is was like trying to make the journey to Palestine as illegal immigrants. Ruth goes through many adventures and finally learns to show her true feelings.  	I liked this book because it taught me what really happened to Jews during WWII and how they escaped. I always learned that Hitler just killed Jews I didn't know how he did it or what the Jewish society went through. 
 A beautifully written work, the usual evocative and sad voice of Margaret Atwood as she inhabits female characters so deeply and convincingly.  The time and place are described flawlessly, you feel you are right there with the characters, and you wish you could swoop in to the story to give them guidance---but you can't. All is inevitable.  Haunting and memorable.  Read it!! 
 The opening of The Mauritius Command brings us some changes, especially for Captain Jack Aubrey, who finds himself in the improbable role (for him) of husband and father of twins. Unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life, he immediately jumps at the chance to leave England and take over a new command. Off the coast of Africa, Jack is promoted to commodore, putting him in command not just of his own ship but of a small fleet. In the course of the book, Jack stretches his abilities to the fullest as the British vie with the French for possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the India trade.   Of course, Dr. Stephen Maturin is on hand too. His facets as doctor, naturalist, and spy all come into play in the course of the novel. The previous novel, H.M.S. Surprise, involved incredible physical suffering, loss, and rejection for Stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this installment. However, Stephen is still haunted by what has happened to him. A dark current runs through him that no doubt will resurface in future books.   The overriding issue explored in this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader. Jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under him, one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar with his men and thus beloved by them. The other is a brave commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule. The weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters.   In spite of the battles and some serious turns of event, The Mauritius Command involves more action and comedy and less angst than H.M.S. Surprise, making it a lighter read.  
 This CD has a lot of the songs I remember from the '80s.  It's a good collection of Hall & Oates songs 
 If there had been a 6-7 star rating for the picture, I would've given it 6-7 stars.  Excellent writers, Good direction, + an excellent cast made for an excellent wartime drama 
 After reading this book I am sure I will be reading other books by Iles. Very imaginative story ala Michael Chrichton. It also had similarites to the DaVinci Code. Some thought provoking themes are brought up in this book. 
 This book was puchased as a gift and I know my daughter in law will enjoy reading it since she is very interested in Papercrafts 
 I tried several different bottles with my daughter and these have worked wonderfully for us.  We actually came across them when Walmart stopped carrying the Parent's Choice Anti Colic bottles we had been using which are similar in design.  These bottles really seem to decrease the amount of air my daughter takes in while she's feeding.  This is a blessing as she has had problems with gas since birth.  She also has reflux.  I can't tell you if the bottles are a major factor in her improvement in that area because she is now on meds.  However, I have to think they've helped a bit.  They are also comfy to hold for me.  I've read a lot of reviews that talk about leaking.  I had this problem once and that was because I heated the bottle with the valve system in it.  So, I learned to not do so and have not had a problem since.  They are a bit pricy, but I believe that you get what you pay for.    Lastly, I don't think that the small parts are difficult to wash.  Yes, it's a bit more time consuming if you don't have a dish washer, but for us, it's been well worth the extra time 
 Weinstein's account is a fascinating illustration of the famous quotation "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely." For better or for worse, the training of a cadet involves tearing his personality down and rebuilding it; unfortunately, the officers in charge of the Air Force Academy have chosen to use this power to take cadets at their most vulnerable and indoctrinate them with their own particular brand of religion. Some of the most chilling passages describe how Jewish cadets are subjected to Mel-Gibson-style anti-Semitism, and how the administration fails to support them.  A good companion to this is Reichen Lehmkuhl's book Here's What We'll Tell Them, about his experience as a gay cadet at the Academy in the mid nineties, and he pervasive homophobia in the chaplain corps. This is a problem in the U.S. military in general, but seems to be a special problem at the Air Force Academy, maybe because of the influence of the many Christianist groups that have their headquarters in Colorado Springs. It sounds like things are totally out of control there!  One disappointment: I was expecting to hear at the end of the book about how the lawsuit turned out. But this is an ongoing event.... you'll have to resort to sources such as Google News to keep up with the latest developments. I note that the suit has recently been thrown out on a technicality, but will be refiled. Mr. Weinstein isn't going away, and I suspect that he will be holding the military's feet to the fire for years 
 I find this a well put together flick. there are parts that remind me of my past, a fast thrill, a fast buck and covering up for mistakes made 
  This is one of the volumes which comprise a series published by John Wiley & Sons. It was edited by George S. Day and Paul J.H. Schoemaker with Robert E. Gunther. (Day and Schoemaker are co-authors of the recently published  Peripheral Vision, published by Harvard Business School Press.) In the first two chapters which serve as an introduction, they suggest that a "different game" with different rules is now being played, and suggest how to avoid the various "pitfalls" of merging technologies. The material which then follows is carefully organized within Four Parts.  "Assessing Technologies": Day and Schoemaker explore technologies' various paths of development, recommend frameworks for evaluating them, and suggest what the role of government should be during the emergence of both technologies and industries.  "Managing Markets": They examine why emerging markets (so different from mature technology markets) require new approaches to research and assessment.  "Making Strategy": They explore the various demands of strategy formulation in emerging technology firms which include the need to combine discipline and imagination, the use of scenario planning, and strategies for dividing the joint gains.  "Investing for the Future": In this final Part, Day and Schoemaker offer insights on using real options to help assess the value and potential of emerging technologies for projects in which NPV may be negative.  For whom will this brilliant book be most valuable? I suggest two different groups of decision-makers. First, those in organizations which have begun - or are about to begin - development of technologies which they hope can achieve and then sustain a competitive advantage and require expect guidance on how to manage those technologies effectively. Also, those in organizations which need expert advice when confronted technologies (developedelsewhere) which will create disruption of a given competitive marketplace and thus pose a serious threat.  For executives in both groups, there really is a "different game to be played," one which has different rules. Winning or losing that game may well depend on understanding the issues and concepts which Day and Schoemaker explain with both rigor and eloquence in this book.  Those who share my high regard for it are urged to check out Day and Schoemaker's aforementioned Peripheral Vision as well Eric Drexler's Engines of Creation, Geoffrey Moore's Dealing with Darwin, Kellogg on Innovation & Technology co-edited by Ranjay Gulati, Mohanbir Sawhney, and Anthony Paoni, The Future of Technology edited by Tom Standage, Thomas S. Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and Joel Mokyr`s The Lever of Riches 
 "Maine Handbook" is the most comprehensive guide to the state of Maine I've come across. In addition to all the usual tourist information, this book includes wonderful little off-the-beaten-path finds, and even has  information on where the nearest laundromats and drug stores are, and where  you can get film developed!  I used this book on a trip to Deer  Isle/Stonington last summer, and was very glad to have it 
 I don't write many reviews, but I had to for this one. D'Ambrosio is a favorite author of mine and his books are few and far between (I'll be looking through The New Yorker for my next fix). One of the stories didn't capture me, but I'm not going to ruin anyone's time by saying which one - we all have our opinions. If I had to pick a favorite though, that would be The High Divide: trenchant emotions, so beautifully expressed. And the ending sticks with you. I had previously read this short story and I happily read it again. It's a book you won't want to give away. 
 I like all of Sue Grafton's book some more than others.  This was one story line in particular that I liked.  One complaint I do have is about the beginning to the middle of her books are "slow" for me.  Once I get about half way I feel they pick up more and then I cannot put them down.  I like that Kinsey finally has a boyfriend and seems to care about her appearance.  Sometimes I do get tired of all the extra situations that have nothing to do with the mystery but on the whole it was a good read.  I would recommend reading this book

 I was never a fan of O'Reilly, due to the fact that 100 percent of the time, he has no idea on what he speaks of. I am not at all surprised that this book was released. In fact, it had to be.   Bill O'Reilly is no different tham any of these neo-conservaitve ideologues out there(Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Alan Keyes, Joe Scarborough, Laura Ingraham, Michael Savage, etc, etc) who whine about a mythical liberal media bias. O'Reilly, of course, is a straight up, pathological liar with NO MORAL VALUES WHATSOEVER. And he is by far the last person to be lecturing anybody on moral values considering his recent lawsuit and writing a book portraying teen crack whores.  Here's an example of his rants against the "liberal" media:  The New York Times: "Primarily a left-wing organization"  The L.A. Times: "The Pro-Palestinian newspaper of record out there in L.A."  NPR: "A liberal slant... twenty-four hours a day."  Foreign Press: 'Well. everywhere else in the world lies. If you see foreign coverage, it's just a bunch of propaganda."  No Bill, YOU are propaganda.  
 Putamayo recordings are a bit different from the mainstream music of a culture- they are known for their research into getting more of the heart and soul of music of a region rather than the top/pop stuff that everyone knows. This is true of this item.  Enjoyable to listen to and dance.  The tape was included in a gift basket of Mexican food given to friends. They called me while they were cooking and enjoying the music in the background 
 I am surprised at how many reviews I have read which are confused about this plot. In "Anne of Avonlea", Anne is hired to be a teacher in an all girl school. Her bossom friend Diana is engaged and gets married to Fred. I love how each character had his/her own uniqueness. In this movie Gilbert proposes to Anne twice!(you'll see) I absolutely love this 
 Taking from the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf, Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarsson pulls the broad poem down into a successful two-hour film filled with heroes, warriors, monsters and love (everything you need in an epic, right?).  The Norse hero Beowulf (Gerard Butler, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, 2004) is called upon to aid King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST), Lord of the Danes, in his bloody battle against a massive troll named Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson, K-19: THE WIDOWMAKER). But once within King Hrothgar's realm, Beowulf discovers much more than just a deadly troll.   Grendel kills only the strong men, and is selective even then, for his wrath is one of vengeance. King Hrothgar and his kin killed Grendel's father years ago, and now the troll is bent on revenge. Beowulf is initially unaware of Grendel's grudge, but our "hero" warrior soon learns of it via the beautiful but dangerous witch, Selma (Sarah Polley, DON'T COME KNOCKING).  That Beowulf is battling a hero status he doesn't feel deserving of is also observed throughout the film. The additional battles of the many gods now in danger of falling to "the one God" (Christianity) is also touched on, for King Hrothgar and his clan feel that the many gods have abandoned them and perhaps this new God will help protect them.   That Grendel is not just a monster but a flesh and blood being is quickly sensed as we watch his father killed for no particular reason, and experience the anguish of his isolation from the world (he plays a type of bowling game with skulls for entertainment). Even his need to procreate is vividly portrayed as he pays a nighttime visit to Selma's home.   So when the end comes for Grendel, it is surprising, touching, bloody, and brutal. That Beowulf is forced to use his deadly warrior skills only adds to the terribleness of the deed that needed to be done.    Filmed entirely in Iceland -- complete with stubby Icelandic horses -- the film's panoramic views of the stunningly beautiful countryside contributes to the rounding out of the story. Lengthy waterfalls, green hillocks, and bizarre stone formations are all incorporated through the camera lens, giving the entire production an otherworldly feel.  Any faults are directed at the initial rushing of the story during the first 30 minutes, and the deep brogues by some actors/actresses that make it tough, at times, to understand what is being said.  But all-in-all the story is pulled off exceptionally well 
 This is an excellent manual for those interested in all aspects of aerodynamics.  Originally printed for U.S. naval aviators, it covers aerodynamics from pistons to jets, fixed wing and rotary wing.  The manual includes information on Basic Aerodynamics, Airplane Performance, High Speed Aerodynamics, Stability and Control, Operating Strength Limitations, and Application of Aerodynamics to Specific Problems of Flying.  The manual is written at the university level and has graphs and formulae liberally sprinkled throughout the book.  However, this is not an impediment and I have used this manual for many years and find it excellent for basic information.   
 So let's see; I waited entirely too long between finishing this and writing it up, but we'll give it a try.   It's the future, and something very odd has happened to Earth, presumably due to runaway technology. Humanity has spread to other planets, and a bureaucracy with institutions named things like The Stone House and The Puzzle Palace has a division called Technology Transfer that tries to keep this, whatever it was, from happening to the rest of humanity. On the outskirts of the solar system, humans have carefully-controlled contact with Earth, in the form of a huge enigmatic Sphinx. After talking to Earth, you have to let the bureaucracy examine your memories and expunge anything they find disturbing there.   In this context, a bureaucrat comes to one human world, one which has tragically abused technology in the past and so has had even more of it than usual taken away, in search of someone who (probably, or perhaps) has smuggled in something forbidden and is abusing it. The world is a strange and rich one, and it's about to undergo a phase-change, in which the seas rise to engulf nearly all the land, and all the life on the planet transforms into watery alternate forms, or dies. There are wild last parties, cities being hastily disassembled, lost fortresses slowly sinking under the water, enchantresses and wizards and demons who may be technology-enhanced, or hallucinations, or only rumors. (There's also some nice memorable sex.)   So anyway, the bureaucrat moves through this world on this mission, assisted by his high-tech talking and transforming briefcase, and various odd and interesting things happen. Eventually he encounters the person he was searching for (more or less), and finds out just what is really going on (more or less). And he and the briefcase both undergo transformations of their own.   It's a good book, a memorable book, a book with fascinating images and ideas, where technology blurs into deity and myth, and I can't recall a single nit to pick. You should read it 
 I love this movie...I loved it when it came out in the theaters, and I loved it on DVD...and I love the special editon which gives a lot of great information on some--but not all--of the actors who played in this quirky, fun movie.Its a great coming of age story; it spawned at least 2 cd's of "Music from" and it holds up amazingly well due to the nature of its character driven story. I've read that Dublin is not now the urban wasteland that it was when this film was made, but its still a great story for any kid who grew up--or is growing up--on the streets of any urban environment. These Irish kids believed that they could channel the Black Experience long before Eminem. If you like a movie with heart and both kinds of "soul" you'll like "The Commitments 
 -I'm not big on RPG's so I don't know much about the "Final Fantasy" games, but I do hear that the scores are largely excellent so I was a bit surprised when the game composer wasn't used and the great Elliot Goldenthal was brought in instead. Unlike the movie which is a beautiful disappointment, the score is fantastic and definitely one of the best from this very underrated composer that does not get the respect he deserves.  -The best piece of music on the album and one of the best musical cues I've heard in my life is "Race to Old New York" which starts off with this fast moving strings that plays this simple melody, then shortly after the brass comes in and picks up the melody which keeps going to the short cue comes to it's natural resolution. I don't seem to remember hearing that cue in the movie which was a shame because it's so wonderful.  -Other tracks that should make glad that you have ears are "The Phantom Plains", "Dead Rain", "Code Red", "Music for Dialogues", "Winged Serpent", "Zeus Cannon", and "Adagio and Transfiguration". I love how he blends the techno stuff with the orchestral elements in "Dead Rain" and "Winged Serpent" is just creepy as hell. "Zeus Cannon" is a majestic piece that sounds like the music that should accompany a Greek god. "Music for Dialogues" is a great piece that should be familiar territory for all Goldenthal fans.   -There is an isolated track on the DVD which is great, but Goldenthal seems to have the same problem that great composer Marco Beltrami has, which is to talk over the music. Most of the cues he does talk over are on the album so it's not that big of a problem, although I do wish he would have actually talked for the scenes when there was no music. 10 minutes would pass by and we won't hear a peep from him, but he is a brilliant composer so I guess we can forgive his lack of great DVD commentaries.   -Even if you find the movie to be a little disappointing, the score should keep you interested. It's fresh, it's great and gives birth to "Race to Old New York" which should be included in any filmmusic geek's top 50 of great musical cues of all time 
 "Sick Girl" is Master of Horror member Lucky McKee's entry to the Showtime series.  Shy lesbian Ida (Angela Bettis) is an etymologist who develops a crush on artist chick Misty (Erin Brown).  Ida gets a mysterious package from Brazil containing a type of bug never seen before.  After Misty moves in the strange bug disappears, soon after Misty begins acting strange.  Ida confides her weird suspicion to her misogynistic but basically good natured assistant Max (Jesse Hlubik).  This is a rather odd entry to the "Masters of Horror" vault, though not unwarranted.  It combines sci-fi, horror, and black comedy to get it's effect.  The first half of the film is basically a lesbian sitcom, "The L Word" taken much lighter.  It is here we meet and begin to care for our cast, and my hat off to McKee, this is one of the best ensemble of the series so far.  Ida by herself is a kooky character, but I guess we're used to Bettis doing that ("May" and "Carrie").  Brown has the harder job; she has to go through so many changes of character, and she has to be convincing, she did good.  Ida and Misty are so cute together, and their relationship seems pretty convincing and real.  I bought it.  The sexist assistant could have been annoying, but he was too nonchalant to have that held against him, and you can tell he genuinely likes Ida.  The best part of the movie was Ida's relationship with Lady Bug, a 10 year-old-girl who lives with her grandmother.  The little girl looks up to Ida and sees her as a hero, a small but nice touch about acceptance.  The grandmother is the apartment super, who is the only weak link, a stereotypical old bat who doesn't agree with Ida's lifestyle.  Now that we have the characters in place, that's when the weird stuff starts happening, and when bad things happen to good people, we care.  So I enjoyed it, even if it was a horror-comedy, a genre I wish would go away 
 "Maximum Fitness", is yearround workout that will keep your body guessing. Stew really put some thought into the workout programs. The book is broken down into 4 basic workouts-cals,hard-core pt, cals and weights, weights.  I have personally done the all 52 weeks of the program. I missed a workout here and there, but in the end at 30 yrs old I was in better shape than at 20. I had more strength and stamina. Stew's workouts are physically and mentally challenging.   I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a challenge 
 Don't listen to machine99. The album is brilliant. He is trying to be Bob Marley? What? I didn't know Bob Marley flirted with Trip-Hop and sampling. Maybe he did, who knows, but personally, I think the album is smoov and  charismatic, a terrific aural experience. Some great mood songs. Prime cuts  are Ride On and Turn the People on and Your love gets sweeter 
 If you have any questions about life, faith, etc. read this book.  Buffy fans learned so much from her actions while watching and this author explains the emotions and spiritual conflicts behind the episodes so well.  Changed my whole perspective and as Jana Reiss spends a whole chapter saying: Change is good.  I don't feel so alone or scared of tomorrow.  When things do get to me, I just think to myself, What would Buffy do 
 I have read several books recently on this topic and for my money this was at the top.  Points well illustrated and discussed with enough detail to make them applicable 
 This book is a fun read about bees.  Definetly not a technical manual, so I don't know why the "How to Keep them" part of the title got added on.  There's a lot of good historical information about bees, biological information, and some tricks of the trade from Sue who is a commercial beekeeper in the Ozark Mountains.  She shares some great stories about her life, which is intricately woven with the lives of her bees.  
 This is a great book for teachers.  It has wonderful meditations, beautiful flow series  and good medical info too.  It is a well rounded book and a great addition to my prenatal library 
 Am very please with The Book of Common Prayer I ordered.  Is perfect size and print and very handy 
 For people struggling with Asperger tantrums/breakdowns/lock-ups/rage, this book offers many insights and strategies to understand, prevent and manage the behaviour. Highly recommended
