 This book offers little new.  Its a rehash of other books published over the past several years.  The photo quality is good, but again, I saw nothing I had not seen in other books.  Don't waste your money!  I expected much more than a 36 page book 
 I rather enjoyed Kenry's first book, Can't Buy Me Love, so I looked forward with anticipation to this one. I was sadly disappointed. The machinations of the characters are grotesque, and while the lifestyle depicted is so overdone as to be obviously fictional, I am nevertheless offended by the glorification of robbery, falsehood and self-indulgence that Max attempts to teach Dillon. I realize that this is not intended to be a serious work, nor is it intended to teach a way of life - but it is nevertheless extreme to the point of distaste. Max's attempts to manipulate everyone around him are almost nauseating, up to and including seducing his nephew. Max is self-centered to the point of blindness, and I found myself hard-pressed to maintain an interest in his schemes. Dillon fails to see anything aberrant in the behavior he is being taught. He ultimately recognizes Max's selfishness - but indulges him anyway. At the end, I found the whole mess singularly unpleasant and thoroughly unamusing 
 This is the WORST prep book for the SAT (along with the Princeton Review's Math workout). Do not buy this, it is extremely short and is filled with errors ranging from incorrect answers to faulty grammar. Having grammatical errors in a SAT Reading and writing prep book shows how seriously PR takes the SAT. I felt like I was editing the damn thing.   Another thing to note is THEY USE THE SAME QUESTIONS MULTIPLE TIMES. I do not understand the point of this... too lazy to make up new questions? I bought both the Reading and Math book and feel cheated and used. This is a warning out there to everyone, do not waste your precious time on this book. As I have said in my other review, somebody sue these flukes. 
 It was about a 12 year old boy and his best friend and baby brother.They pretend that  the tornado is just not goning to happen but the weather channel says a tornado is going to hit ground. Dan and his best friend think thats it not going to happen but then the winds start to howl and it starts to rain and hail.  Then the boys know they should have listened!  Read it to see what happens to them 
 I am so used to Andre Norton using just the right amount of details to stimulate my imagination and then leaving it up to me to fill in, that I found this book very draggy.  It wants to tell you everything and leaves  nothing to the imagination.  I have never read anything by Susan Schwartz  but if this is her effect on Andre Norton's work I don't think I will.   Sorry, I like Andre Norton's style.  And, while she collaborates well with  some people, I don't feel that this is one of those times 
 It's another one of those literatti illnesses... "Oh, wait, the writing style is spare? Then it must by Raymond Carver-esque!" As capable as the writing is, the realizations of the protagonists of these stories never hit home for me, the epiphanies never seemed to... piph... enough, or whatever epiphanies do, as Carver's did. If you like your fiction in the "huh? oh, i get it... sort of... i think...", then this may be for you. The man certainly has a buzz about him. But if your taste generally runs toward the sharp, 70 miles an hour clever type of literary fiction, walk away, my friend. And oh yeah, Richard Ford? I don't think s 
 if you find a free frequency it work well, if do not you spend a lot time to find it 
 I was very disappointed that the songs on this album were not a comprehensive list of the songs that I saw in the movie. It's a compilation of mediocre songs. Big disappointment 
 I actually returned this book after thumbing through it.  Unfortunately, it is just the photography of one man, and not a compilation.  Unfortunately, he has a defined theme, contrasting beautiful women with decaying urban settings, which grows very stale.  I found a few photographs to be very artful, but overall I felt they worked more-so as landscapes than as nudes 
 PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! Ive read several mafia books and this is by far the worst. All Roemer talks about is him self theres actually very little about Spilotro???? He mentions and kisses up to every cop and agent he's ever meant??? He thinks J Edgar Hoover was god??? This book is extremely boring? hardly anything about Spilotro. I dont even know why he bothered, after reading this book I would have given him my money not to write it!!! Complete waste of time! Did you know that Roemer used to box in college? well you will when you read this book I dont think theres a single page that he doesnt mention it?(joke) Each chapter starts with a couple paragraphs about Spilotro and then page after page about himself and everybody in the world BUT Spilotro???? THANKYO 
 a better title for this book might be, strange signposts in an otherwise interesting world.  He became a devout Catholic while the rest of us were questioning its relevance. C. Pierce's psychologic discovery or insight does not seem especially significant.  This MD does not provide the right presciption for our times 
 I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.  I could not finish it.  I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it.  So I traded it in at a local used book store.  I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress.  The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody.  I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book.  And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.    I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book.  It was very disappointing 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 Seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that James Frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as Billy Crystal.  But then they can only put out the cotton-candy Coney Island fluff as '700 Sundays' is.    Granted, the book is based on Crystal's highly-praised Tony Award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  But it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night Kaddish.  Yet in ripping a page out of Billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  It probably went something like:   "Hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 Sundays with your pop?"  "Well, I'm not a writer per se.  I just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage."  "So here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have."  "It'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads."  "Don't worry, bubby, I know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  Here's their recipe: They'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.  'How?' may you ask!  Well, they'll cut `em in half, then cut `em in half again.  And using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- Slap it all together between two hardcovers...It'll be just fine."  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry.  Consider it like a vintage bottle of Mogen David 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout.  In this case, the local bookstores.  Oh, and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more.  People'll drink it up."  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry, Face.  Everybody loves ya.  Just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about Satchmo and Mantle, you'll be all right.  Don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. Y'know `700 Mondays;' then `700 Tuesdays' and so on.  Yes'sir, I can see it all now:  We've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick.  Oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too, starting with `700 Hanukkahs!'  "You're still friends with that kid, Adam Sandler, back from your SNL days, aren't ya?!  Yes, so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that Hanukkah song of his.  It'll be a great collaboration.  It's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. Y'know God blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do.  Yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 Passovers!'  "And it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha know.  Just think, when people see Chuck Heston...may God keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see Chuck Heston and The Ten Commandments, they'll be thinking about you too, Billy.  Yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on Passover, you'll see.  "Oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal we'll get `700 Yom Kippurs!'   You'll see.  But this will be only for our people, Billy, you understand.  So you might have to dig deep to get material for it.  But that's what authors do, they dig deep.  But you already knew that, right?  Can you dig it, man?  I knew that you could.  "Yes, but..."  "Don't worry, Face, everybody loves ya!  Your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that.  But hey listen, with a book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal, we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets.  Mark my words we will.   "And say, since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get Martin Scorsese to produce and direct your life story.  Yes, it'll be something like 'Pinch Me I'm Still Jewish: The Billy Crystal Story' in widescreen and all that jazz.  It's what everybody in Hollywood's doing right now.  Yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead already, Billy - God forbid.  No, siree, bubby!!    "So Scorsese will do the movie on the cheap, because God knows the man deserves an Oscar already.  You know it, I know it, we all know it, Billy.  And not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the really big one, see!  And just imagine, wouldn't it be something if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed Marty his own Oscar?!  Yes, well, we can schmooze on about all this stuff later.  "But for now, with the books and everything, you'll be a one-man franchise, yes you will!  You'll be on the New York Times Best Seller List from now until forever!  It'll be great!!"  "Yes, but..."  "Oh and well, I didn't want to say anything just yet, but, okay, here goes: There might be plans to expand everything too!  Listen, bubby, I know somebody who knows somebody who...you get the idea...over at the networks.    "We can do a little Chris Rock in the neighborhood sort of thing.  We'll put a kid who looks and acts like you - about as tall as you - into the neighborhood that you and your family lived in, see.    "And it's going to be a period piece too!  We'll introduce all the new kids to the stars of yesteryear -- y'know, Cantor, Jolson, Jessel, Durante!  Throw in some goniffs and shiksas that the cast can work off of every week -- It'll be fun!    "Chris Rock is great.  But you can be greater too.  Listen, Face, we'll make it a celebration.  Something like 'Growing up Mazel Tov!'  Maybe we get 700 shows out of it.  Maybe less, maybe more, but people will still love it anyway.  You'll see!"  "Yes, but, well, I'm not really a writer/author.  I'm an entertainer, so why would I want to do any of this?"  "We could make a couple of dollars!"  "Okay. I'm in!"  And so it went and so it goes.  Final analysis: A So Not Looking Mahvelous, Better Luck Next Time, With All Due Respect, Sadly Not Recommended Book.   
 OK.  I'll admit this review might be unfair.  I didn't even finish the book.  I might have missed some real gems. But, since I didn't finish it, I thought I should explain why.  I found the essays to be well written but the guys I just couldn't have a lot of empathy for or really understand the point behind many of the essays.  The Boy Toy, the guy who was proud of his "threesome" affairs (as a regular fare), the man looking for a "Female John Wayne", the guy whose wife had an affair that he "forgave" her for and then spent 7 years wallowing in the relationship, had an affair of his own and returned to find her in the arms of a woman", these are "typical" guys?  Maybe on Jerry Springer.  Not all of the essays were completely bad.  The 47 year bachelor had some interesting things to say.  The guy with the open marriage was refreshingly honest (even though he didn't use his real name) about the inherent problems with "open" relationship (although I still think he's fooling himself).  The essay about the guy who was short-tempered with his children almost actually hit home.  But, overall the book is not worth my time to finish.  I am a 45 year old, happily married father of 2. I have been married for 15 years. I had a pretty decent life before marriage and can actually remember those days pretty well.  I picked up this book looking for some light reading and maybe some insight as to what makes men tick.  I freely admit, I'm not your typical guy.  I thought it would interesting and entertaining.  I made it through the first five or six essays.  I didn't keep count.  Normally, I'll plow through a book no matter how bad it starts off. But, I decided to put this one down last night and probably won't pick it up again.  Maybe my wife will read it when Oprah decides to put it on her list.  Women would just love to bash men with this one 
 Not what I was expecting. Overpriced for inferior illustration 
 Ultimately, the flaw in Lessig's books is his belief that the revolution of personal computing and the internet are the products of intellectuals like himself.  Undermining the freedom and property rights of the programmers and companies who really invented these marvels is a profound threat to one of America's most vital and creative industries 
 in plot depth and character development.  You'll read in other reviews the actually plot and character names, so I'll keep my review a discussion of execution only.  The book is not poorly written, but everything just seems  to happen without a smooth flow.  Yes, the sex scenes are inventive, but it  all seems rushed with more lust than passion.  I didn't find myself caring  about either character.  Plenty of sex but little romance.  I was actually  more interested in the peripheral characters who are denizens of Mac's bar;  who seemed more colorful and more real.  I was a little disappointed given  the really high marks this book got, but believe with more time the writer  will develop a polish that would make her characters a lot more believable  and replace her sex scenes with sensual love scenes 
 I gave this a good listen, but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable 
 I enjoy reading TV and movie critics to see how a good movie works or a bad show doesn't. In this collection of opinions, Mr. Tucker has no information on why a show does or doesn't succeed. Also, few things are black and white. He either hates or loves a program, period. If he hates it, the show has no merit. If he loves it, it can do no wrong. It appears this book was thrown together overnight after he looked at the TV Guide for titles of shows and just gave his hate/love of it. Worthless unless you think Mr. Tucker's opinion is the best. Also, it is painfully unfunny 
 I've read a bit more than half of this book, and I can already say that it is probably the most RACIST book I've ever read. While trying not to make race a big issue in this novel(I think that's what Lehrer was trying to do by having a diverse debate panel), the author made the fact that Barbara Manning(African-American) and Henry Rodriguez(Hispanic) were minorities THE central issue inadvertently.  Every time these two characters are mentioned in the novel, their ethnicity is brought up.  Even worse, the character of Henry is a stereotype of Mexican people.  On page 111, it is mentioned that Henry's favorite food is a bean burrito.  Nearly every time Henry makes a statement in the novel, he uses the word "Ole`".  I'm still waiting for him to break out and start refering to people as "Essay"(which, I'm sure is coming up)  I think that the only thing Lehrer knows about Hispanic people is what he learned by listening to Cheech from Cheech and Chong!  I'm not even going to start on the fact that every Republican in the novel is portrayed as a Neo-Nazi-type of supervillan.  This is a book with weak characters that use poor dialogue 
 I've listened to Static X for several years now and I can say this CD is absolutely horrible. Every song is almost identical in the way it sounds. There is no songs that mix tempo or anything. They only difference between songs is the word that they yell for the chorus. It's almost like they're not even trying anymore. For anyone expecting more of a Machine or Wisconsin Death Trip sort of CD I would definitely stay away. 
 Roger Waters would scoff at this rip off. Some Pink Floydish tunes mixed with sound effects and sonic interludes. Pompous, arrogant...I'm sorry but this group is not the modern answer to the great prog hope. I'm sorry but I can't relate to this nor Spock's Beard's horse hockey. For the retro lover like Spaniel Pegrossa 
 As a former student of the O.S., I feel entitled to interrupt Raines' eulogizing about Bettelheim with a few questions: 1) Why is it so easy for this Raines guy to downplay, whitewash, sugarcoat etc., the repeated beating of  emotionally disturbed children and teens? I mean if he was being beaten by Bettelheim in the name of a very distorted theory (namely that beating and shaming children will help them overcome their fear of inner aggression), would he so easily rationalize that abuse was good for him?  2) Why is this guy so impressed by how beautiful the Orthogenic School looks? Why does this prove that Bettelheim has the best interests of children at heart? I sure didn't care about fine china or pretty tiles while someone was repeatedly pounding on my body to get me to eat...and by the way depriving me of seeing anyone privately in sessions for the first 4 years of my stay there.  I think Theron Raines needs a course in how to relate compassionately to children.   Also, I want to offer an alternative explanation for why Bettelheim created the Orthogenic School. Raines includes Bettelheim's explanation at face value. First a look at Bettelheim's explanation. Bettelheim says he based his idea for the O.S. on his stay in a Nazi concentration camp. When Bettelheim saw how this sadistic milieu so completely destroyed personalities of sane people, he realized that he could rebuild destroyed personalities by creating a nurturing, understanding milieu. Well, this explanation sounds so nice at face value. However my sense of the underlying truth is that Bettelheim hid his deeper motives possibly from himself and certainly from others. He actually created an environment with certain rather horrific similarities to the concentration camps. Of course, not nearly as horrific. But, remember, the population that came to the O.S. already had weakened or damaged or destroyed personalities, plus they were children...so the Orthogenic School's cruel, sadistic side didn't have to be so blatant to wreak havoc on these emotionally fragile people. I think Bettelheim was enraged when he saw weakness or vulnerability in children. In fact, I think he was drawn to autistic children because he admired how disconnected they were from their feelings. But, for those children who actually still showed some vulnerability, well they got the smacks and the whacks and the beltings and the nasty cracks. I think Bettleheim created the O.S. as an outlet for his own rage at being made to feel powerless and abused at the camps. He used his brilliance to hide his true intentions. And I guess for many reasons, no one ever said boo to him about his thirty years of abusing children. Maybe some staff just assumed he must be right because the University of Chicago supported his work. Maybe some staff were too intimidated by him to question what he said or to report his terrible abuse of children. Maybe some staff got off on being cruel to children themselves. Maybe some staff were dumb.   Now, Raines tries to prop up his idealized picture of Bettelheim with reports of children with "Good Leavings". And he focuses on one "success story" in particular. But, from reading this "success story's" own version of events (in a book entitled The Thing I Was),  it appears that one of the MOST successful graduates was practically overcome with ambivalence about what Bettelheim did to him. Even this person describes Bettelheim as capable of terrible physical cruelty and shaming. And even this person clarifies that the main reason he was able to feel better about himself was because of a compassionate counselor who did her best to protect him from Bettelheim.   But, somehow, in Theron Raines' heart of hearts, the abuse seems to mean nothing to him. He doesn't seem to care about all the children who suffered terribly during Bettelheim's reign. So, please read this book with a grain of salt 
 Elizabeth Lowell is a good author, but she's really bad about re-issues.  I've been tricked by her books before.  I don't know if this is her publisher's doing or her own, but it makes me think twice and twice again before I buy anything with her name on it.  She's been writing for a long time--I can't always tell from the synopsis if the book is new or not.  Her re-issues or new releases ought to be clearly labeled as such (I think Nora Roberts does this now.)  You have to open this book and look at the small print to discover she previously published this as "The Ruby" under Ann Maxwell.  I don't know what the rationale behind this was, but it's hard to imagine it was done in good faith.  
 While I am glad that Ms. Olsen found the courage to speak out about the effects of severe child abuse, I found this book to be one woman's meandering tyraid against practically everyone and everything in her life, past and present.  It was difficult to follow and depressing...and I also have DID.  I did not find it the least bit inspiring or encouraging for fellow multiples.  Rather, I found it to be written in an almost self-pitying and egocentric manner. This very well could have been a message of personal testimony coupled with inspiration and encouragement.  However, the book is filled with one-sided rants that are very difficult to follow. If you are a multiple, do not look to this book for any hope or encouragement.  
 I was hoping that this book would go through the history of technology leading up to the ESB, discuss how the ESB solves the problems presented by previous solutions and talk about some best practices for building ESBs.  Unfortunately, the whole book goes right into the sale pitch telling you that ESB is the solution to problems that we previously were unable to solve! And, ESB appears to have no downsides! And, there are some great vendors out there that can solve all your problems!  EAI didn't work for you? That's because Hub-And-Spoke doesn't scale. But, the author doesn't spend any time on what people did to address these problems. How about distributed components? Of course, they didn't work... no exactly sure why, but ESB solves the problem!  The redeming part about this book is that it does provide a good overview of what an ESB is. It also provides you with a lot of terminology that may be new to you.  However, I wouldn't buy this book again or recommend it to anyone. Instead, I would recommend a lot of other good books on SOA that tell you about how we got here and how the technology pieces are around to help support new solutions to previously hard problems 
 I love Eddie Murphy, and I loved Dr. Doolittle!  The previews of Dr. D II looked so funny, I couldn't wait to see it.  Well, I just saw it, and my mind has still not recovered.  Dr. Doolittle 2 is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The story and dialouge are so mind-numbing, even the animated Murphy and Raven Symone, who plays his teenage daughter, couldn't salvage it.  The story revolves around Dr. Doolittle trying to save the patch of forest behind his house from a land-hungry developer.  To do this, Doolittle must rehab a tame bear and make him wild, because this bear is an endangered species, and if he lives in the forest, the developer can't touch it.  Sounds kind of cute . . . it's not.  The bear acts and sounds like a washed up Vegas lounge singer.  His whiny voice (Steve Zahn) is so annoying that even I, a passionate animal lover, could not summon a shred of sympathy for this bear.  And talk about long.  This whole thin storyline is dragged out for ninety minutes until I writhed in pain.  And the other animals!  A sad, alcoholic French monkey, a chamelon with a horrible Mexican accent, and an abusive bear and his passive female bear.  When the bear is not whining, a dog is narrating the whole film in another nasal, bland voice with HORRIBLE dialouge.  A subplot involves his daughter rebelling and liking a boyfriend who is a complete idiot, is dropped off by a pizza delivery car and asks to stay two nights.  Murphy actually acquieses.  What an intelligent, lovely girl like Raven would see in this sorry homie is completely unbelievable.  It is hard to believe people (and animals) are going hungry when millions were wasted on this fart of a film.  It seemed like the voice actors were embarrased to be saying such stupid dialouge, and that the animal actors were embarrased to be acting such stupid roles - and I don't blame them 
 I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now 
 I tried this and it didn't work. To this day I still am a smoker 
 Un très joli livre technique illustré comme au 19ième sciècle avec une multitude de planches décrivant autant de mécanismes. Chacune des cinq cent situations laisse imaginer un mouvement insolite. On en redemande.. 
 I generally like Sheldon's "beach" reads.  Usually great fun which decent premises.  I'm not hard to please.  However, this offering was dismal.  Storylines were picked up and dropped without resolution.  Most of the characters were grossly underdeveloped or mere stereotypes.  You know going into a Sheldon book that it's not going to be an English Lit assignment, but this one was weak in comparison with his other selections 
 It has some funny moments but it's certainly not Pratchett's best. As crazy and sometimes corrupt Hollywood is it's not the sort of industry where Cthulu would be comfortable. The combination just doesn't make sense. And then there's the talking dog. On about every fifth page Pratchett stops the plot (what little of one there is) to do yet another talking dog joke 
 I picked this one up at the store with Saw and Silent Hill, thinking that it would be in appropriate company.  Was I ever wrong!  The Tooth Fairy is of profoundly lower caliber in every way.  While the concept was good, the execution was the real horror in this one.  Cut out the stuff that television censors don't care for, and you've got a "made for TV movie" - period.  Apologies to the other reviewer who claimed that the acting between the two little girls was good, but I have to disagree; it's some of the worst acting I've seen, and I'm hardly a movie critic.  My take?  Do yourself a favor and buy something else 
 What does it mean when someone gets excessively-defensive? It doesn't express that they have peace or comfort with themselves.  Writing sludge like this just fuels the fire - that I suppose they are trying to put out. If .. there .. WAS .. ever .. a .. fire. 
 Writing s{ ,\z }{}xms when you mean s/,$// (as suggested in this book) is borderline idiocy. If I wanted to be needlessly verbose, I would have written it in Java. s/,$// is concise and works in sed and vi too 
 If I could give this device a review of less than one star I would. An MP3 player is nothing more than a usb memory stick with a player wrapped around it. It should just work. However I've run into the following while attempting to set it up.  1. Unrecognized device. Uninstall USB device and try again... 2. Device malfunctioned. Uninstall broken device from device manager and try again. 3. Recognized device but says there are two removable disks that are both zero bytes in size. 4. Links in tech support page all give 404 errors 5. Device driver download from coby, only downloads a font file. No driver.  It's too late in the evening to call support, it was a christmas gift for my son from out of state. No reciept, can't return.  It might make a good item to throw at the neighbors cats when they get in my yard.  Other companies have figured out how to make a portable music player "just work" with my computer, why can't these guys?  My time is much more valuable than the time I spent to not get it working 
 I found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities. Spend your money on Days of Knights and Damsels by Carlson 
 I bought this CD (EP) with great anticipation. After listening to it the only voice in my head asked, "why did they release this"? After "Out of myself" and "Second life syndrome", I thought this combination of wonderful musicians was near perfect and the guitaring sublime. The few new tracks on this EP are slow and ultra-short and the live tracks are crude and rushed. By now, Riverside fans expect long, complex and hypnotising songs and they will be very disappointed in this CD. Riverside, please give us another Second life 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 I am an avid reader and could not make it through this book. His other books were so good. I could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be. In applying some of the recommended techniques, my 11 year old daughter, Emily, thought I lost my mind. Thank goodness things are back to normal. We are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice 
 I read this book because my friend loved it. I have to say I was shocked that someone with Norman Cantor's credentials could publish such a sloppy, rambling book.  It was more of a stream of concious essay than a rigorous (or even non-rigorous) examination) of the plague. Fortunately, it was a quick read because of repetition, large type, and lack of meaningful content.  What made it worse was Cantor's arrogant notes in his critical biography at the end of his book: for example, on Jean-Noel Braben's "Les Hommes et la Peste" - "verbose, unfocused" , on Robert Gattfried - "The text could have been better." and Devid Herlihy - "The last two chapters of Herlihy's book are puff pieces of speculative nature [...] and are of modest value." It's one thing to write a bad book, but does Cantor have to trash other scholars on top of it? Not to mention that Cantor's book suffers from the same faults Cantor accuses other authors of. Shocking. I do not recommend this book.  Rambling, repetetive, unfocused, speculative, and tangenical. Useless index and no footnotes. 
 Whether you agree or not with Revel's views, and in large part I think I could be persuaded (by a more reasoned argument), his presentation carries the whiff of desperation that accompanies all ideologues and partisan hacks.  This book is no doubt very popular with people who already share its worldview. I came across it looking for a reasoned and reasonable presentation of viewpoints not necessarily my own. What I found instead was a book full of logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, straw men, and the worst of the rhetorical games that can be played.  If you want a cheerleader to get you pumping your fist in the air a la Rush Limbaugh or Al Franken or Michael Moore or Bill O'Reilly, then this book will be great for your enthusiasm, if not necessarily for your intellect.  If you're looking for a thoughtful exploration of the nature of America, her standing in the world, and the reflexivity of that relationship, look elsewhere. If you find it, please let me know, I'm still looking 
 I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience. The burner did not simmer well (the flame kept creeping back up) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died. It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly. I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be. Hmmmm. I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one. This one was immediately defective and I took it back. Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more. Camp Chef may be a better, though much more expensive, choice for a person who does a lot of camping 
 A really bad book. Parts about Wal-Mart strategy are not correct.  A typical sentence:(On CarMax) "Traditional dealers break even or lose money on the sale of new vehicles, making most of their money on new car sales (about 75% of profits), service (40% percent of profits) and finance and insurance (30% percent of profits)." That adds up to 145%.   etc, etc. 
 The outdoor sensor is not waterproof.  Outdoor sensor died after 3 months. Don't waste your mone 
 Wack cd. Low quality producer/s and talent.  except for about 2 or 3 artists (rakim & ken-y being the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 stars) this whole compilation is a complete waste of your time and money.  If you value your hard earned money then may i suggest "Los Kambumbos". it is a compilation of high quality produced by dj Jova and it includes a pantheon of quality artists including; trebol clan, khriz & angel, Nicky Jam, Tito el bambino and more. 
 Funny that a book about execution doesn't get it accomplish. The authors have a lot of experience and I am sure are good at leading and executing. However, the book does not get to the point. The authors ramble about their managing experience and almost 300 pages to transmit few ideas 
 This book presents an interesting thesis: Big companies should not try to produce radical innovations (ie, innovations that create a new market based on a new technology) but instead they should scale up the new markets and make money doing so. The authors support this position with two main arguments: - It is not only difficult for big companies to create radical innovations, it is often contrary to their best interest and culture. Big companies have no incentive to change their markets. - If big companies are not good at innovating, they are very good at scaling up markets (due to their existing relationship with distribution channels and customers). Since most of the money in a new market is gained by scaling it up, big companies should focus on their strengths rather than trying to become more innovative.  This thesis seems to make sense. However there are many problems that are not properly addressed in the book. First, it is not clear how a big company is supposed to enter a market at the right time to scale it up. The authors provide only vague information on how to do that although it is central to make their suggestion work. The examples of big companies jumping into a market and scaling it up are not convincing. For example the authors cite Ford. But Ford did not just scale the market for automobile, it was a pioneer too. The authors do not provide clear examples of how a company is supposed to consolidate a market without being in it first. Second, the authors make an analogy with creative industries as a model for inventor/distributor cooperation. The model is sketchy at best. Why not study some real cases such as the recent cooperation in the pharma industry (eg, Imclone/BMS)? It seems that the authors did not invest the time to fully fledge and support their ideas.  The Harvard Business Review published an article in April 2005 about the factors that help or endanger first mover advantage. Among the factors are the speed of technology evolution (the higher the more likely a second mover with deep technical skills will be able to win the market) and the size of the market (the bigger the more likely a second mover with strong marketing power will win the market). The creative industry that the authors use as example belongs to the last category: power lies with the companies that have the marketing clout to push the movies nationwide. It is quite telling that a 10 page article does as good a job as this book at elucidating some of the issues with first vs. second mover advantage.  The thesis of the book is interesting. Unfortunately the supporting material and the practical advice are very light. I believe the book would have greatly benefited from less repetition and much more thourough case studies of consolidating companies. The book is a disappointment.  (If the authors haven't done their research they seem to have enrolled enough people from London to give the book glowing reviews. Read them with a critical mind. 
 This towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low--one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric (like dust-bunnies) formed on it too.  Perhaps it would be good to use as an oil rag, but not in one's bathroom 
 It never ceases to amaze me how conservatives prefer a brief read to something written in depth.  Perhaps some things are much too challenging for narrow minds.  I couldn't help but read some of the reviews, and I can never understand how conservatives can say liberals always have to revert to name-calling and using the word "stupid", and yet they constantly pepper what they say with insults themselves.  Typical.  I used to respect anyone's opinion, and I still try to, but when people clearly ignore facts and cling to their biases, without considering what they can see or use common sense, I have to call a spade a spade.  This book is funny only to those who find drivel funny.  It's not even well-written.  
 After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves 
 The line is very thin in this book. It is a very short read. For those of us actually in the Air Force, the references to Security Forces are hard to get past being that the author researched nothing into the USAF at all. None of the facts about the Air Force  or SF are accurate. That being said, we are on to the story.  Like I said, it may be horror, it may be porn. Hard to tell. The author has a particular afinity for rape scenes.  All in all, it is a very dumb and unsatisfying book. It seemed a good effort for a teenage author in need of release for violent and sexual frustrations, but for a thinking audience, this is hardly worth the time to glance over the back cover. 
 "The Book of J" is an attempted restoration and critique of the original source document of the Pentateuch. Bloom first introduces the proposed author of this book - an original and provocative ironist, a lady of Solomon's court, who has been totally misunderstood. The next section is a translation of the reconstructed book of J by Rosenberg, who has also authored a brief appendix about the translation. The following two sections include Bloom's commentary on the book of J, its narrative, personalities and themes. This is the silliest book on the Hebrew Bible that I have ever read. It is obnoxious, almost totally unsubstantiated, and replete with simple misunderstandings of the Hebrew text. Bloom's somewhat euphemistic admissions that he is neither a historian (12) nor a biblical scholar (41) are the only parts of the book that I agree with. He mocks religious Jews, Christians, the "abominable Jeremiah" (176) and, with particular frequency, J's God. To the unprejudiced reader the God of the Hebrew Bible is majestic, awesome, and holy throughout, nothing like what Bloom describes. The arrogant claim that the Hebrew Bible or its proposed substrate has been misunderstood for millennia by people devoted to it needs much stronger support than the speculation that Bloom provides. Among other things, we learn that God sits in the terebrinths of Mamre eating curds (12, 258) (a total misreading of Genesis 18), that God loves David but not Moses (41) (contrary to Exodus 33:11-12 and Numbers 12:7), that Moses becomes the founder of circumcision (245) (contrary to Genesis 17), and that God doesn't punish Moses for good reason (34), without much explanation. However, we are told that traditional Jewish and Christian expositors are "weak readers" (34) and "mad" (246). Virtually no secondary sources are offered for the assertions made in this book, though we hear occasionally about Noth, von Rad and Van Seters, among a few others. To his credit, Bloom mentions the opening words of Cassuto's commentary on Genesis (20), but fails to engage at all with Cassuto's stunning rebuttal of the documentary hypothesis. I recommend Cassuto's "The Documentary Hypothesis" as the perfect antidote to "The Book of J". Not a shred of archaeological evidence is offered in support of Bloom's assertions. Other literature of the ancient Near East receives no treatment. The content of the Pentateuch places its composition firmly in the late second millennium BCE, and its style and structure parallels other ancient texts of the Near East of that time - until it is mutilated and divided into its putative sources. For the relevance of this evidence to the dating and composition of the Hebrew Bible generally, I recommend Kitchen's monumental "On the Reliability of the Old Testament". Bloom and Rosenberg's transliteration is very inconsistent, and we're even treated to the non-existent form "v'yhi" (329). Rosenberg translates from standard editions of the masoretic text; but I think that for a task like his a critical edition would have been better. Readers looking for an introduction to theories about the composition of the Hebrew Bible should look elsewhere. In my opinion, the documentary hypothesis is speculative, unsubstantiated and discredited by archaeological evidence, and the hypotheses of this book add assertion to assertion, and speculation to speculation. I do not recommend it 
 This book is very well laid out, and points out both sides of the arguments. Very good for seeing what one side says to one issue, and what the other side says to the same. However, some issues are touchy, inerrancy being one.  Page 146 "the Bible is a  trustworthy communication by Spirit-guided interpreters and is true in all it intends to teach." The Bible was not given to men to teach them science, but the God of Science is the God of the Bible - If the Holy Spirit is the author of the text and He errs in some matter (in this case of science) then God is not God.  B.B. Warfield, whom they quote for the "conservative" position, is right. Go get a copy of Revelation and Inspiration, Oxford Press, 1927. Still the best. I am very concerned with how they also handle the Holy Spirit. While they acknowledge His place in the writing of the Bible, all I seem to read about is what did the author on earth mean? I see precious little to help one understand the place of the Holy Spirit upon the authors, except for a bit here and a dash there. How about what does the Bible say? Could we please get to that? I really do wish more biblical texts were quoted.  I am WELL aware many interpretations exist, but this does not negate the fact that we cannot deny the singular purpose of The Scriptures as the revelation of Jesus Christ. Yet, the reader feels lost on this point, and that could also be due to the fact that this book clearly needs an editor. As a humanities major, I went through line by line, and condensed almost 70-80% of the sentences. No appendx for terms, and a cursory index of subjects - I am disappointed that Nelson would let something like that slide especially when this book is used in higher education. It is a good book. Well researched. Covers both sides of an issue. Points the reader in the right direction. Helpful for the foundations of hermeneutics. Footnotes as far as the eye can see. But better exist. Can be improved - all hope is not lost -but a drawing board will be needed. 
 As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book.  While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest 
 My wife and I are avid music afficionados, with over 2,000 rock CD's alone.  I heard so much about the Foo Fighters over the years, that I finally decided to play my wife's CD with an open mind.  My conclusion: this stuff is far from groundbreaking, and sounds like any other predictable cheesy, no-talent garage band that loves to scream and play the same 10 chords over and over.  I like rock that challenges and engages the mind and displays unmistakable song writing craft.  Something this CD does not do in any obvious way.  My feeling is that the kiddies that listen to them are starstruck by Dave Grohl's 'flash-in-the-pan 15 minute' past with Nirvana, and they automatically think his new band is going to be just as great.  Don't waste your money on this formulaic predictable mediocre schlock rock.  Even my wife admitted that she listened to this CD only once, and that she hasn't touched it since!  I wouldn't even use it as a coaster for fear that my drink may sprout legs and 'run away'!! 
 i like the song of salif that why i look for one of his like les ambassadeurs international with salif keit 
 If you know the physiology, and want to review, get a little deeper, then OK, BUT COME ON. Have the other reviewers used this book to learn physiology from. The writing is horrible, the book needs an editor. Perhaps the writers should have taken some more writing classes, and less physiology when they were in college.   Don't use this book to learn physiology! It just bombards you with facts (like I said, a reference manual) but is horrible at explaining concepts, so then you just sort of memorize, memorize for exams, and a month later you can't remember anything, because it's such a mess in your head.   
 Many of the claims of this book have been proven false or misleading. Please don't this book. Please don't give this person any of your money. The new book by Peter Goodman is the actual truth. I would suggest that instead 
 This book has the same old information you have already heard.  I really did not like this book.  It had several items that are false in it, like gorillas eat meat, which they do not.  It has lots of negative information on various foods but offers no suggestions on where to buy an alternative product.  I just do not see the point of adding this book to your library or collection.  No new information whatsoever 
 I recently bought the Sibelius Volumes 1 and 2 in 2-in-1 sets. I wont comment on the artistic content as they are covered in others reviews of this page. The sound quality of Vol 2 is decidedly degraded - almost unlistenable - compared to the much much higher quality of Volume 1 (with magnificient artistry). The transfers are AAD on the Phillips label which, like DGG, of the 1970's are not meant for better quality music systems (even of that period) and unless remastered disappoint the listener. It is possible that reissues for this particular packaging could be faulty or may be that the repackaging is so cleverly done that all the goodies are on Volume 1 and the second-best on the second. Davis is redoing the Sibelius Synphonies with LSO and that may account for the rush to get this set out of the way 
 I read this book because I have an interest in prehistoric sites and wondered what a famous self help guru might have to say about them. I looked forward to a spiritual discussion of these ancient, enigmatic monuments. Unfortunately the book turned out to be more about Mr Peck and less about megaliths. If your idea of fun is reading a long list of complaints about food, hotels and the lack of refuse bins in train stations etc then this is the book for you. His views on Britain are a continual whine about how it is "not like home". When not complaining about breakfasts, the author indulges in long, self indulgent monologues about his family, beliefs, infidelities and smoking. Honest maybe but I ended up feeling very little sympathy for him. When we do get round to talking about prehistoric sites his "insights" are questionable to say the least. I can understand how someone can wax lyrical about a little known dolmen in a field, after all beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However his dismissal of the dramatic and beautiful Pentre Ifan left me speechless. If you want to visit prehistoric sites in Britain please don't use this book as a guide or you will end up missing some truly beautiful places. Just to set the record straight the reason that there weren't any bins in the station is because at the time of his visit, terrorists were planting bombs in them. If the author had stopped complaining for a few minutes he may have found this out for himself. 
 Yes, it is easy.  But it was too easy to the point it was just lacking any interest to me at all 
 I listened to the audio version of this book. While most of the things said in this book may be true, it appears a bit biased. In addition to facts, the author uses some adjectives which show her personal dislike of the famous couple.  In the end, I had an impression that this book grew out of author's frustration upon Mark Rich pardon. Many chapters are dedicated to that case.  A disproportionately large portion of the book is devoted to two topics: pardon and donations. At one point the audio book spends a large amount of time only listing names of who donated what item. It goes on and on and on with names that make no sense and contribute nothing much to the story. That could have been moved to the appendix to keep the flow going.  I was hoping to find details about mischievious behavior by Clinton staff during the last days. There was no mention of that 
 This novel of a 17th century samurai's odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way, but towards the end, Endo does get in a few good points. The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. It's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. I can only conclude that a lot of people who don't really have much experience of Japan, think they've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai's sword 
 This book was obviously slapped together as quickly as possibly to take advantage of the (at that time) rapidly emerging Microchip PIC market.  A significant amount of it is completely irrelevant or even misleading material which apparently was copied from the author's previous books about completely different processors.  Another large part is just verbatim copies of free Microchip literature.    Of the material that appears to be original, there is in my opinion too much opinion and anecdote.  This is debatable, as some readers will prefer a "chatty" style.  Worse, however, there are many, many errors, something on the order of one per page. (!)  Some are editing problems such as typographical and grammar errors, but a distressingly large number show a real lack of understanding of his subject material.  I feel the author's "I'm so smart" attitude comes through as well, and is particularly annoying when combined with the above.  The PCB and code included for building a programmer don't work -- more evidence of rushing to publish.  In his defense, he has posted "updates" on his web site which address this problem, but as I understand it they require a lot of changes and don't completely solve the problems of the original design, which he has abandoned in favor of another.  This is a sufficiently unprofessional effort that would I regard with great suspicion any other of the author's many similar works.  It was more than a waste of my money -- it was a waste of time and sanity.  I'd pay to never have seen it. 
 There are alot of good tips in this book, however it is poorly organized.  I felt like I was reading a church cookbook, where everyone submitted something and everything was included, even if the same thing had already been said 10 times.  It is very frustrating to read 
 Misleading title. I had to put this book down 1st time I picked it up. You see he told me I was the problem then proceeded to only offer solutions to fix my family. No case studies, no references to previous solutions, no suggestions from immediate help. Nope, ODD children are created by the parents. Hogwash.  I'm sick and tired of "professionals" telling me that my child isn't the one who is bringing in the problem to my family. That it's me and my misguided attempts to thwart his behavior constitute abuse.  Here's how I see it. My child needs help. We need help. We need real tools to quickly deal with his problems so we can get to the other side and start to deal with the complex issues  a ODD child creates in the family. The way I see it is if you're here looking for help, your not abusive - you need support. What kind of support is it to be told from the start you're the problem. Your desperate and in need of immediate solutions. Not told to take your wife on a picnic, go to the movies or on vacation. You need suggested actions based on real life scenarios.  Don't buy this book unless you need to be told you're the problem. Which your not. It's not your fault - especially if your here looking for solutions 
 Purported knowledge not IN style anymore by the socalled academic elites.  Evolution, in the boxing ring got a KO by Professional scientists who UNderstand that KO means down.  Who LIVES for evolution other than those who live IN illusion.  Some day there will be enough people on EArTh to expose the lies of this ridiculous theory.  Until Then, Lies they will tell, and Exceptional lies they will be 
 I must admit I was skeptical about this book upon seeing Buzz Aldrin on the cover instead of the books subject Neil Armstrong.  I tried to give the author the benefit but upon reading the book it was just filled with too many factual errors to be considered an accurate account of Armstrong.  Admittedly I am an aircraft and space enthusiast and someone who didn't know about the subject would not catch the most of the errors in this book, however, the erroneous information discounts the validity of the book in my opinion.   It's a shame because what an intriguing character Neil Armstrong is 
 I must confess that I watched this movie after having seen "Howling II" which is the worst werewolf movie I've ever seen except for "An American Werewolf in Paris".  Thinking that the original had to be a lot better than the sequel, I watched the original "The Howling" with an open mind especially given the good reviews this movie has received, and I came away very disappointed in this movie.  Indeed, despite the good acting (Dee Wallace-Stone, especially for a horror movie), "The Howling" just fell flat on its face as a horror movie.  To be perfectly frank, I just did not find the werewolves to be frightening or scary at all...I thought they looked ridiculous, and the way the movie developed was just terrible in my opinion.  In turn, "The Howling" comes off like a joke more than anything else.  Ostensibly, the story seems quite compelling as a newscaster is attacked by a maniacal killer and then goes with her husband to a retreat to recover.  What transpires at the retreat, at least in theory, would seem to make for a scary movie, but the creators of this flick just blew it with the ridiculous looking werewolves, poor character development and, to a large degree, a lack of action or a lack of compelling action.  What action there was appeared absolutely laughable and totally ridiculous.  I just don't think the creators of this flick knew what to do with this movie when they got to the part at the retreat.  When I wasn't laughing at how terrible this movie was, I was VERY BORED watching "The Howling".  Frankly, I just thought the movie lacked luster and completely sucked.  Well, at least it is not as bad as "An American Werewolf in Paris", but that isn't saying much!  I would not recommend "The Howling" to any individual that is serious about his/her horror movies.  If all you want is some laughs and cheap thrills, maybe you will like this garbage, but I recommend sticking with "An American Werewolf in London" as it is, in the opinion of this reviewer, the greatest werewolf movie of all-time.  That being said, I must admit that I am completely mystified by the glowing reviews this movie gets...some people call "The Howling" a great horror movie, but I just call it rubbish 
 Far too religious for me.  I do not think this book presents a healthy way to respond to grief 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant. I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat, watch TV, or drink his sippy cup. This chair was the perfect height, design, and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky. The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip. The fault is in a joint. I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed. But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two. That joint is really weak. Too bad! It's such an adorable product 
 Carter wins on giving us numerous minutia about Blount's life and his odd selection of friends. But her book was not of great interest to a reader who was aware of Blount's peculiar nature and interest in art. It is difficult to understand how Blount or his friends, seemed completly oblivious of politics as Carter has laid out. Unless she is making the case that Blount was the perfect mole - at all times on guard against exposure. But I don't think she is trying to make that case.Carter gives us a blur of names, quotes, and a failure to find mention of expected comments in corresspondence such as the passing of Blount's father. It may be Carter's intention to show Blount's world as an extremely focused life which was hardly influenced by outside events; such as the end of World War One and the rise of Communism. I suspect Carter is trying to explain Blount as a Good Boy Who Does Bad Things 
 Made and first released (as Tell Your Children) in 1936, when Prohibition still protected innocent youth from the purgatory of alcohol abuse, Reefer Madness began life as a morality tale to protect innocent youth from marijuana. Tell Your Children was a low-budget production, made by G&H Productions for a small church group.  The director had gained almost all of his experience in silent film. So, the facial expressions and gestures of the actors are exaggerated as they were in silent films. This "problem" became an asset later.  The movie begins with a Star Wars like scroll that touts marijuana as The Real Public Enemy Number One! The film hammers on marijuana so hard that at one point a doctor is relieved to find that his patient has only had heroin and not marijuana. Clearly, story, written by Laurence Meade, and the screenplay, written by Arthur Hoerl, could have used some validation by a real doctor with real drug treatment experience.  It was Dwaine Esper, a pioneer intellectual property pirate who bought the rights to the film, spliced in some salacious sex scenes and marketed the resulting Reefer Madness as an exploitation film. As a sensation exploitation of the marijuana menace, the film made some money for Esper. Then it fell into nameless disuse and eventually passed into the public domain.  In the early 1970s, Keith Stroup, a founder of The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), paid less than $300 for the film, cleaned it up, and began showing it at rallies. The pomposity and overacting were a big hit with the (frequently stoned) marijuana advocates.  Since then it has achieved cult status. It is up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  All this would make Reefer Madness a genuinely funny viewing experience were it not for crack, and heroin. I felt bad watching this film, not because it was not uproarious camp, but because I live in the center of a fine, historical city where mothers try to sell you their crack babies, and heroin addicts mumble incoherently trying to panhandle in front of the halfway houses where they have been dumped.  If Amazon, or those who reap the profit on the sales of this DVD, would donate to quality rehab programs, I would feel less like taking a shower after watching this 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 This book was disappointing. The main characters were flat. The reader cannot get to know them or care what happens to them. There are so many secondary characters that it is hard to keep everybody straight.   I also had trouble "getting into" the scene. A good book will draw me in, making me feel like I'm there, participating in it all. I could not get that from this book.   This is supposed to be a Christian book, but God is barely mentioned at all. He doesn't seem to have a place in their lives. It's like He is an after-thought.  I will not read any other books that follow this series. 
 The original Jungle Book was inventive, whitty, uplifting and charming.  The characters had depth and a beauty that in its time was unique and wonderful.  The original Disney Jungle Book story was told with great feeling that was a source of fun and inspiration to me growing up as an autistic child.  I can honestly say the original Disney Jungle Book movie was the only movie I loved that also touched my heart.  Jungle Book 2 is is just a very badly executed attempt at recreating the awesomeness of the The original Disney Jungle Book.  Jungle Book 2 fails in all attempts to recreate any of the magic of the original Disney Jungle Book.  Jungle Book 2 is endlessly bland overall filled with nothing at all to justify wasting a moment of your life watching.  You will be better and more deeply entertained for hours watching newly poured cement dry compared to watching a moment of Jungle Book 2.  Don't Waste your time wacthing this garbage it is not worth anyones time or money.  It gets one star only because the amazon system does not allow me to post zero stars or better still stars in negative numbers 
 This is one of the worst stats text books I have ever seen.  It is very hard for someone with a logical mathematical background to understand.  Most statistical problems are addressed in text versus examples.  I would never suggest this book to anyone!! 
 this was gawdawful!!  the characters strain to be eccentric.  they try soooo hard to be interesting and odd that they, ironically, become forgettable.  there is not one particular trait in any character that stands out.  parker posey is supposed to emulate jackie kennedy.  none of jackie's personality is reflected, nor are her mannerisms, nor does she get quoted.  parker posey's character merely dresses like her.  ooooohh!  really pushing the boundaries!  and then they seemingly throw in the incestous affair as the last resort bait to capture our attention, kind of like they have nothing else in their tackle box.  what a waste of a great cast!!  it's completely disappointing as a funny / entertaining movie, but it beats watching prime time tv 
 I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.   It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.  Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on.   Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.  Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.  Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".)   It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.   This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.   A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.  On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her.   As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.  These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.   Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.   It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.   So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.  There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.   I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.  For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not. 
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 I bought this on sale for $7 and thought I would give it a try.  Within the first 30 seconds I knew I made a mistake.  This is the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen!  I didn't even finish it and plan on throwing this DVD in the trash because I'm embarrassed to have it in my collection.    This DVD is a complete waist of time and money!  Do NOT buy this!  Don't even waist your time watching it!  Don't even watch it to see what all the fuss is about if you're wondering "Just how bad could this really be?"  Trust me and all the other reviewers, your better off doing something else with your time. 
 Okay...look at the cover...it should tell you one thing...take your time...as obvious as can be.  Corey, you do not have to turn your back on American Idol, we have turned our back on you.  Do not waste your money on this piece of trash.  It would be better to light a match to your money.  Weak attempt at fame and Corey's 15 minutes ran out years ago.  Did he ever really have 15 minutes

 Just 16 years apart, Rory Gilmore and her mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.   In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.   Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark throughout the seasons -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.   Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky "townie" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.   In this season, Luke and Lorelai FINALLY become engaged...making the dreams of many fans become a reality after six years of flirtation. However, just as they've settled into a comfortable routine, Luke learns of a 12-year-old daughter he never knew he had. As if the plot weren't stupid enough, April is essentially a younger version of Rory -- smart, bookish, loquacious and endearingly geeky. Why couldn't they just have given more emphasis on the relationship between Luke and Rory? It's hard to figure out what on earth the writers were thinking -- IF they were at all, that is. 
 Bloody Mary is a very poor sequel to Whiskey Sour. It is the same book, basically. Once again, a powerful sociopath has a personal vendetta against Jack. I hope the author has something new to offer in the upcoming third book in the series...Unbelieveably, according to the reviews of Rusty Nail, the 3rd book, he recycled the story again. Forget it 
 A dear friend recommended this book to us. Upon receipt I immediately turned to the section on pregnancy and birth control as I am an avid supporter of the protection of the unborn babies in our world. I was HORRIBLY dissapointed at the presentaiton of the material in this section. This is supposed to be a 'Christian' book yet they used terms like 'fertilized egg' instead of baby to explain the way that birth control pills can prevent the implantation of a baby into the womans womb. They even say that if that occured it wouldn't be an abortion of a baby. Any basic sex ed class teaches that fertilization occurs BEFORE the egg reaches the womb; actually occuring in the fallopian tubes. Needless to say I CANNOT recommend this book for any person seeking Biblical teaching on planning a family. "Children are a reward from the Lord" and "Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them" Psalms 
 I was impressed with the charger for about 1 month---than it stopped charging the NiMh batteries it came with.  I took it back to Best Buy only to find that ALL of the Rapid Chargers on thier shelf did not work either.  A sales person and I tested them all, hoping I would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked.  It was more disappointing  after calling Kodak ---they were unable to replace it or get my money back.  I thought purchasing a Kodak was a smart decision, however, they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing.  
 I began subscribing to Gourmet in 1961, and continued to subscribe for about forty years. I also gifted family members with subscriprions.  I discontinued my subscription because the magazine has deteriorated so much in the last several years: There are so many ads and tear-outs in the magazine that one can hardly find the recipes, at least half of the magazine, and sometimes more; also I object to the "political," and some downright offensive, articles. I am Catholic, and I was very offended by an outrageous article charging that, during the Nazi era,  naked Jews were made to crawl through the streets on their knees by persons, which the article linked in some way to the Catholic Church. I think that the information was apochryphal; and, what does this have to do with food?   
 I would think twice before ordering this edition.  It took several months to arrive and for some reason I thought I had ordered a set of the books.  Instead, I got a big, unwieldy brick of a book with very small type.  I've been trying to read it, but a lot of the time I do just as well by going to the Project Gutenberg site and reading the book there (but not all volumes are online yet). One advantage of reading online is the easy ability to look up vocabulary.   For the price, it's simply not worth it 
 As another person stated this is a romance novel disguised as a suspense thriller.  For that kind of book it's ok, a quick read.  I've read much worse of this type.  At least I finished it.  I just wished they would stop making books like this seem one thing when they are another.  But I did really like Pete and Susie, the dolphins.  Two stars for the actual two stars 
 The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  She goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance.  The storyline is decent in some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.  Many times, I had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going.  It is true there were many points in which I wanted to stop reading all together, which is a rarity.  I was altogether disappointed in the book.  I thought it would be decent, from all the literary awards it had won, but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 An under researched book that fails to capture a sense of Black London. Interesting writing style but the portrayed environment doesn't ring true 
 Elections take place at the precinct level in each county - the Bushies would have to have PAID OFF large numbers of precinct workers (Bi-partisan control exists in Ohio) to pull off voter fraud and then keep that SECRET - Not Likely.  If they actually did control elections, why would the Bushies allow the outcomes to come so close to losing - doesn't compute!  In 2000, all major media studies concluded Bush won that election.  In fact, in  Miami-Dade County, the "Palm Beach Post" study showed Bush would have actually GAINED six votes over Gore out of the 10,600 disputed votes.  Gore NEVER requested a total state recount in Florida so that argument is irrelevant. The U.S. Supreme Court had to intervene because election rules/procedures cannot be changed "after the fact."    In Ohio in 2004, as reported by Dan Balz, "Washington Post," 6/23/05, a five month study commissioned by the "Democratic National Committee," concluded "there was no evidence of fraud in the outcome."  Further, Cornell University Professor Walter Mebane, Jr., who participated in the study, stated there was "no support whatsoever for the claim that there was large scale mis-allocation of votes from Kerry to Bush in Ohio" and also stated "it is highly unlikely Kerry would have won the state in any case."  Dan Balz also reported that the African American vote turnout was at a record level in Ohio being 84,000 higher than 2000.  Balz also reported that a higher percentage of "provisional ballots" were counted in Ohio in 2004 at 78% versus Pennsylvania at 49% and Florida at 36%.  Also in 2004 in Ohio, a study by several major OHIO newspapers found no evidence of fraud.  I recently saw Mr. Miller on C-SPAN discussing this book and he looked like a "Woody Allen-esque" figure spinning his conspiracy theories.  I had to laugh at most of it - if there had been concrete evidence of actual fraud, the anti-Bush mainstream media would have been "all over it."  My prediction is that this book will end up on the same dust bin of history as Congressman John Conyer's fevered imaginations about the Ohio election 
 I bought this map because it put me over the amount for free shipping, but I was still shocked at the complete absence of quality.  The "maps" look like they were drawn by grade-school children.  One side has the streets downtown: along the malecon, and 7 blocks south of the river Cuale.  Not a single hotel is listed, and many streets are drawn in but the names of the street aren't even written in!  The restaurants are put in, but the information is dated to 2001.  Only a few other items are added.  The other side is an even bigger joke.  It is a very crude drawing of Banderas Bay with exactly two highways drawn in:  200 and 70.  23 hotels are represented by dots along the bay, but there are no addresses and there would certainly be no way to find your hotel from this minimalist "map."  That side also has such helpful tips as "LANGUAGE:  English is spoken in almost all businesses","MONEY:  US currency and credit cards are accepted almost anywhere," and "TAXI: Ask for rate before riding" (well, at least the last piece of advice is accurate albeit minimally helpful). As others have pointed out, you will be able to get far more informative maps for free at the airport.  You would never buy this "map" if you saw it in a store, and Amazon should be almost ashamed to carry it 
 It's hard not to love the idea of this book, just as it is easy to hate marred execution. A fascinating botch job, but still a botch.  As seems to be the case with the authors of many social histories, Kuh is so enamored with the fact that he got to this idea first--and it is a "why-didn't-I-think-of-that? one--that he inserts his story into the mix; in this case, he'd like to see a parallel to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist--but he ain't Joyce, and clearly isn't much of a cook. He's a great hypocrite, however: I found it hilarious that a guy critiquing culinary elitism continuously throws out french dishes without translating or providing an explanation of the dish. You will be amazed at how little discussion of food there is in here.  I won't dwell on the grammatical errors or preening prose--other reviews have--but I will say that the most dishearterning aspect of the book is the author's inability to get over himself, which severely limits his coverage. Clearly, he's not good enough of a writer or thinker to understand his own bias--because he fetishizes the past; makes his time in the kitchen (60s and 70s) to be the most important era in food history (of course!); and then tries to act like a distant, objective journalist for the present, treating it like clinical, lifeless business. This supposed distance kills the book's intent: instead of tracing the evolution of the American restaurant, he ends up lionizing the past and trashing the last twenty years of professional cooking, which get few pages and absolutely no discussion about the food produced. It's remarkable, given all that has transpired in the last 15 years, that he spends no energy on the fact that America is the culinary center of the world, yet can come back to talk about Henri Soule again and again.  The book you're looking for has not been written yet 
 Can't understand what all the fuss is over this movie. It's cute but so boring. I could hardly stay awake. 
 First, let me say I had already memorized almost all of the hiragana by rote before I finally found this book, so I have a frame of reference for both rote memorization and the author's method.  I found the mnemonic devices in this book to be idiotically confusing most of the time.  I gave it two stars only because a handful of the idiotic mnemonics led me to simpler ones that I could actually use for the characters I had difficulty with.  Only a couple were directly usable.  For instance, to remember "ni", the author has you go through a long, complicated story about capes and interlocking combs and knees.  Me, I just looked at the character and it looked like you're looking down at a seated person and their knees are sticking out.  Isn't that simpler?  Really, it would be less effort simply to learn the alphabet by rote, and then you'd know it in the correct order as well.  I found the ditty for remembering the alphabet order to be a handy crutch, but learning by rote teaches it just as well.  I can write the hiragana alphabet table by memory fairly quickly.  I doubt anyone who learns hiragana from this book can say the same.  My opinion is: Use this book if you absolutely cannot learn by rote, but otherwise, you're far better off downloading one of the sets of free kana flash cards found on the web and learning by rote.  It's cheaper and it's better for you 
 The clip holds the money, but the credit card holder is a bit scary.  It just doesn't work that well.  Plus, it is very heavy.  If you put 5 bills in there, even without the credit cards, this thing is like putting a brick in your pocket.  I would not recommend it 
 This text is a nightmare.  Terms are poorly defined, if defined at all, and examples are few and far between.  The illustrations are laughable.  I've seen better graphics in nursery books written 30 years ago.  If your professor assigns this text, and you're new to Java, be prepared to shell out more bucks for better sources or cruise the Internet to get the answers you need.  This book won't provide them.  
 within two weeks the hose connection was leaking.  the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 I thought Silicon Valley was for smart people. A Stanford professor and a retired Cisco executive have managed to write one of the most indecipherable business tombs in recent memory. I was asked to review this book for graduate school and I found it mostly incoherent business babble. "Billiard Ball Management." "Shallowly Rooted Strategic Vectors." "Kinetic Structures Prevail." What kinds of business leaders talk like that today? I often find the best business books package challenging business problems with no non-sense solutions. Save your money. This book is a tower of babble 
 This book was a huge waste of time and money, as all of the information is common sense and copied from other books. I found no new or interesting information here 
 I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard.  It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box.  I performed the power boosting "fix" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal.  This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations.  If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly.  I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car.  It's physically well built and works fine for that.  I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.    If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere 
 Ok, when I first got this I was excited because I love KsE with a passion. I was excited because there were live tracks, and they're Roadrunner live tracks so we know they're good quality. That's the only bonus to the album. The two 'unreleased' tracks, Irreversal and My Life For Yours, have been on the internet since the original was released. If you don't own the original already, get this one definately. However, if you already own the original, there is no reason to buy this one unless you're like me and have to have it all... 
 This book needs a lot of editing, since in it's present form it wanders aimlessly and without purpose for pages and pages before anything of substance occurs.  The book and its attempt to explore the spirit world seems like a spirit: hard to grasp and unsatisfying.  For better literature on Vietnam, try Le Le Hayslip's "When Heave and Earth Changed Places," which has its feet on the ground (despite the title) and a much greater emotional impact 
 Maybe it was more like buyer beware, I was really disapointed in how superficial and extrapolated the content of the subject was. I don't consider this a an essential piece for any serious u2 fan, it  leaves you with way too much ambuguity 
 Character studies of dysfunctional families is a fairly common comedy device.  However, in most such efforts, there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones.  We found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters.  Even the bride (who is supposed to carry the film) seemed fake and unlikeable.  We watched about 20 minutes of this DVD and ditched it in favor of something else.  For a much better "quirky family" movie, wait for "The Family Stone" to come out on DVD 
 I've enjoyed Johansen's books for years, but this one was awful...I'm beginning to wonder if she's using a ghost writer.  Totally ridiculous plot, trite dialogue...I lost count of the times she used the phrase "Sophie said through her teeth..."  I was beginning to wish someone was PULLING my teeth rather than having to read this book.  Johansen is capable of SO MUCH BETTER than this!  I'm praying she isn't falling into the Nora Roberts/Danielle Steel/James Patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher's deadline 
 OK, I admit it would be hard to top the album "Rats." After all, Stevie Salas is one of the baddest guitar players on the planet and the chemistry between Sass and Stevie on the album Rats just jumps out of your speakers and kicks you in the pants.  On Hot Gossip it seems Sass, excuse me, Sas took a wrong turn on her way to the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame and ended up in Teen Pop Limbo. Granted, if I didn't know this was Sass and I heard it on the radio I would say "hey this girl can actually sing." But knowing what this woman is really capable of makes it hard to imagine that she would even consider doing a lame pop album like Hot Gossip (sorry Sass, baby you know I love you!).  OK Sass, maybe you didn't have the success you wanted with Rats and Racine but that was the early 90's and Grunge was big. It wasn't the high point in history for aggressive guitars, powerhouse vocals, and in your face Rock n Roll. I gotta' tell you, you have a lot of dedicated and loyal fans who love what you do, or rather, did. No need to try and sell out.   Allright now, the pop thing ain't working. It's time to fire the Producer of Hot Gossip and get back with Nick DiDia & Stevie Salas........and make another great Rock n Roll record 
 First of all I thought Sat radio advertised " Commercial Free radio" was that. IT IS NOT AT ALL!!!! In fact I spend most of my time looking over the 160 chanels for something not with commercials. (...). They claim they have nothing to do with that. So this is a good buy IF you want another radio player WITH commercials (  A lot of them ) and to pay for it. I got this because I was tired of radio commercials and awful radio announcers who talked over songs and too much. Well sattelite radio is the same thing just with cussing. So keep this in mind before you buy. 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 This book is horrible!  It is  uninsightful and utterly pointless.  The first 200 pages build an advertisement riddled case for healthy diet and exercise that leaves you less than conviced that John Gray has any idea what he is writing about.  Maybe there is a reason the U.S. has outlawed some of the treatments that are espoused with giving Mr. Gray his "insight" into what our bodies need?  The scientific data was never openly stated, but shrouded in mysterious, sensational statements such as "the same diet plan may cause a woman to gain weight and a man to lose weight."  This book left me wondering if John Gray actually believes this stuff or whether he is just trying to fulfill a book contract with his publisher.  I hope that this review does not dissuade you from ever purchasing a book by John Gray.  If you have never read "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" then I highly recommend that you purchase it and refer to it often.  It is a truly amazing and well written insight into the minds of men and women.  Check it out and leave this diet book on the shelf for someone else 
 I got burned when I bought this bomb, but my motives weren't entirely pure, so I have to take the heat for it.  This movie, while not the worst I have seen, is certainly among them - not even Janet Munro as the star could save it.  The effects are purely photographic, the topic is moronic and unbelievable (even if you WANT to believe it, you can't); there's just nothing good to be said about this film except, in my purchasing a copy, there is one less in circulation 
 John Rechy's 1963 CITY OF NIGHT was a shocker in its day, an episodic collage of metro-area male prostitution, sex, and self-destruction written in a style that echoed Jack Kerouac's beat literature.  Although dated by slang, changing mores, and the AIDS epidemic, it still bears reading today as a portrait of  gay street life in the pre-Stonewall era.  NUMBERS, Rechy's second novel, is quite another matter.  NUMBERS is essentially CITY OF NIGHT repeated, but without the "shock of the new," with less style, and with considerably less interest.  The extremely episodic story concerns Johnny Rio, a Los Angeles street hustler who several years earlier overdosed on the lifestyle and escaped to a solitary life in Arizona; now he's back "for just ten days" and, not unexpectedly, finds himself drawn back into the malestrom.  There's nothing here that Rechy hasn't said elsewhere and often quite a bit better, and NUMBERS feels much less a novel than a series of strung-together sexual fantasies lacking significant point.  In this instance, the result is less interesting than annoying; readers interested in Rechy's work should pick up a copy of CITY OF NIGHT, his first and finest work, instead.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 I'm an avid reader of history, as well as processing a degree in the subject.  So imagine my surprise when, after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas, I read the erroneous account of the Children's Crusade of 1212.  I had done research on this topic, so I was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred.  Had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years?  If he had, he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly French people led by Stephen of Cloyes who, when told to turn back by King Philip II, did so.  That ended that crusade.  The other one, led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas, led a group across the Alps into Italy.  Some left for home while others continued on to Rome.  It's interesting to note that in Rome, many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these "children" were either too old or because they were pregnant.  Perhaps until relatively recently, people believed in the Children's Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles (like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred, rather than relying on more contemporary sources.  Nor did they realize that the latin word "pueri" used in the chronicles can have several meanings (such as unmarried men rather than  children).   In the final analysis, you just can't rely on books like these to really teach you history.  The best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it.  If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel's own account of the Children's Crusade on their website, or perhaps read the excellent paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History, or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia.  The book gave two pages to this event, and sadly got it completely wrong.  For this gross oversight, I am compelled to give it one star.  Readers of history, never just believe what you read - verify 
 This film has its moments, though few.  If any of you remember the yahoo film reviewers on the old SCTV comedy show, Big Bob McSomething and Billy Saul Hurrock, I think?  They rated films highly based on the number of excrutiating explosions.  Well those boys would have really liked Vertical Limit.  And, yes, people do get blowed up, blowed up real good, with nitro.  Not that it is a totally bad film.  The scenery is beautiful, but then again it is the high Himaliyas.  The characters are corny and caricatures of those EXTREME types you see all summer.  You know, always running, biking, climbing, yada, yada, yada.  Scott Glenn as the zen mountain man pondering savior of them all is almost comical.  This all being said, Vertical Limit, will take up an evening if there is nothing else to do 
 My view is skewed.  I was in VA-196 and flew with Steve Çoonts a few times as a B/N.  His book captured our collective squadron stories and placed the A6A Intruder into the public eye.  People would tell me about their experiences while reading the book...they did not know my connection to it.  Steve wrote so well that they could smell the cockpit and sense the adrenalin.  While the movie paralleled our actual experiences at sea and in port, it did not convey the excitement of the book.  So, I was disappointed in my expectations and give the film a good try. W. Stewart Tittle, Lt USNR 1966-71 
 Although listed as in stock when I ordered it was canceled due to unspecified reasons -- I assume it is NOT in stock.  The item is still listed as available although apparently not for everyone 
 This book is good as a primer if you want consider achieving a CCNA.  This book is not good as a study guide for the exam, due to its lack of granularity on most CCNA subjects 
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 I bought a CASE, they expire in one month. They taste great, But SHAME on AMAZON. I also bough Butter Rounds, they expired LAST YEAR 
 This book is written from the point of view of someone who doesn't like cats. It's amusing but not laugh-out-loud funny 
 Although this book is sweet, it is not plausible what happens in the end.  The book creates a setting for a young boy who is not able to talk, who is suddenly able to speak after six years of silence.  The book portrays a Christmas story.  I would not use this in my classroom, only because it is so unreal.  Being a special education major has made me see that a book about a child with a disability needs to be straight forward. These children are just like anyone else.  This book, however, does not show that and seems unreal 
 The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters "Guard One" just shows you don't even try to care. The plot is so hair-brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache -- I just learned, to my horror, that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times. I'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise, but it's been ruined forever by... this. Somewhere, Baby Jesus is crying 
 You can use them as a "skin" but to use them excercising or on the move is no good.  The attachment to the strap is poor and the ipod is on a clip that can rotate so when you're moving it is swinging around and just not useful for anything other than standing still 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 bought the cable after 1 printing the USB connection failed, so called manufacturer he said cable was broken and gave me a RMA, Emailed tiger they said I would have to ship back at my own expense, called amazon they gave me another person to contact at tiger, they said to ship it back and they would reemburse me. It would cost as much or more to ship back, and since getting conflicting statements I don't trust them to reemburse me. Would suggest you stay awa 
 This book is short on practical "how to" advice on breastfeeding, and long on preachy passages that attempt to convenince all moms to stay at home and breastfeed until your child is 8.  I'm a working mom of 3 and have extensive experience with breastfeeding.  There are about 3-4 pages of this book that actually inform, and the rest is an attempt to pursuade mothers to stay at home and breastfeed the rest of their lives.  
 I bought this for the little things, and for that it works- as long as it doesn't take you more than about 3-4 minutes to clean up.  The battery on this thing sucks.  It takes a long time to get a full charge and a full charge means only about 4 minutes of battery usage. Save yourself the frustration and spend the extra few dollars to get a higher quality vacuum 
 Hopefully THIS isnt the image the world has of the AMERICAN. If it is.....no wonder we are such a despised bunch.   First off....this book pretty much said nothing new. It is a "either you toe the line with US...or you are a traitor and giving comfort to the enemy" bunch of re-hash.Standard, neo-con, defense of each and everything that this administration does type thing.  The thing I found funny....I guess...is that he says WHY WE FIGHT? Is is just me....or do all the bloated, fat, wannabe heroes who write this stuff pretty much fit the DRAFT DODGER....sit in the back and start the fight and not get involved mold!!!???  Itis ALSO hard to read about how we should do all this from this virtuous air sack while he preaches to the masses and then does exactaly as he pleases at the gambling table. Oh....but then we are told by HIM AND HIS PACK OF TALK SHOW LEACHES that it was OKAY for Doctor Bennett to doit cause he could...ugh...AFFORD THE LOSS!!! YIKES!!  Moral clarity....better get some DOCTOR BENNETT before you start pointing your fat fingers at everyone else!!!  I guess this would be good reading to someone who wants their already neo-conistic views confirmed...the same reason to listen to his ridiculous radio show. But the hypocrisy of this arrogant, do-gooder was almost too muc 
 I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible.  My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end.  On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films.  Best in Show belongs to a genre of "comedies" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are "Waiting for Guffman", "Bottle Rocket", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie 
 I like her JP Beumont books but this book seems to think I have been acquainted with the characters in other books, which I have not. I never could get into the book because the characters were confusing so I quit 
 Here we have another extreme left-wing attempt to rewrite history as a means to promote a contemporary political agenda.  That agenda on this occasion is to maintain - by any means necessary - against overwhelming public opinion government enforced and sanctioned racial discrimination in which select minorities (minority elites usually) have advantages and privileges bestowed upon them regardless of personal merit.  The facile and intellectually childish premise of this book is that since during the New Deal etc., white Americans enjoyed legal and extra-legal advantages, those practices can be interpreted as constituting a kind of "affirmative action."  To equalize things, then, we must continue to give the same said select minorities privileges as "payback" for the past.  That during the period of Jim Crow there was systematic discrimination against certain people of color is unquestionable.  That that discrimination somehow functioned as a form of "affirmative action" is sophistry at best, and complete nonsense (as in literally, it makes no rational sense) at the worse. We may as well contend that the general restriction of the vote until 1920 to men, the traditional limits on landowning by Catholics in Ireland, or any advantage for anyone in the past were examples of "affirmative action" (guess we have to bestow equal advantages upon everybody - wow! what a concept!)   The actual model in Western society, and one that best serves as a basis for understanding the preferences, quotas, and the rest of the ugly tyranny that is affirmative action in America today, is Stalin's Russia, where people with appropriate "working class" backgrounds were given a legup over those unfortunate enough to have a grandfather who, say, owned a shoe store.  Periodically, they also labled such "fortunate sons" as "enemies of the people" and dealt with them "appropriately!"  The one point the author simply cannot refute in his rush to "prove" his ideologically based argument, and therefore does not address, is the question how, if racial discrimination was wrong in the past, it can be made right in the present? No matter what word or mind games he offers here, he is lost.  Affirmative action is clearly unconstitutional, clearly unjust, clearly wrong, clearly dying a quick death in these early years of the twenty-first century (witness the recent passage of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative by an overwhelming margin), and can only be "justified" in the terms of the "what is good for me is therefore right" school of thought.  File this book under garbage by someone who does not know or understand history, the Constitution, or even concepts of justice so basic as to be well within the intellectual reach of a child in a playground - and then forget it entirely!  One last point:  calling people names whether it is "racist" or a "troll" because they have a point of view different from one's own is a regrettable propensity of the left today - one that is largely responsible for the left being simply ignored by the American people. How about actually attempting to engage in a logical discussion for once?  
 I stopped watching this after the first episode. The Animation is nothing like the movie GITS. Also there is quite a bit of cgi used  in the series. The music was nothing like the original and the actors who did the english dub sounded corny to me. The only similarity between this and the movie is the premise and plot. All of the atmospherics are gone. There are numerous still shots where only the mouth moves. This is a very tame and uncreative version of   ghost in the shell. All in all if your a die hard fan, I guess you will like this no matter what. If you expect a lot as I did you will be diappointed 
 I personally find the review very apalling,the good fact of this book is there are lots of drills.I recommend BILL HANDLEY'S full course in speed mathematics for a very simplified straightfowrad approach.THIS book doesn't really teach you a art of calculation,but continuos drills of different calculations.Horrible book don't buy it only if you like to practice continuous drills.garbage!!!!  
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
  It was probably brave to make any sort of a film out of Rudi van Danzig's book. Doubtless the controversial part of the subject matter of this film, an 11/12 year old boy part-willingly seduced by a 19 year-old soldier, was the reason that it was awarded the Best Film and Audience Prize at Turin in 1993. It cannot have been for any artistic merit or general craft competence. When Jeroen and his mother emerge from their flat we are expected to believe that this is Amsterdam after more than 4 years of Nazi occupation and deprivation. The flats and street are in immaculately good condition. The children being packed off to Friesland so that rest of their families shan't starve are pictures of good health. Was the budget for this film so pathetically low that the producers could not drive around The Netherlands coastline to find a village for the arrival of the Canadian liberators where there weren't bollards on the footpaths to stop people parking cars there? Doubtless McDonald's was just around the corner. I laughed. I thought of Monty Python.  As to the main topic of the film, the relationship between the soldier and the boy, do not expect this to remain totally from the child's perspective as it is in the book; there are trite lines of self-explanation from the soldier. The book quite believably develops the relationship between the child and the man, the film doesn't. Since the film is only 92 minutes long perhaps the answer is a censor's sharp scissors, not an example of the film-makers' overall artistic failure. Or perhaps they just hadn't got enough money for enough scenes.  The small, redeeeming part of the film is the depiction of the devoutly Protestant people of this ultra-provincial part of The Netherlands; I believed this representation. In this the film shares it's small success with another poor film set in an extreme end of a maritime country, which relies on sex to get people to watch it, "Breaking The Waves".  Do not expect this film to bear more than a passing resemblance to van Dantzig's book. Do not expect to see a work of art. Don't waste your money on this DVD; instead, if you haven't done so already, buy the book 
 Forget Summers, Father Satan has already dealt with him and all those hypocritical fools who thought they could play around with the demons, hold them in chains, and embarrass them. The demons are free now and anyone who wants to follow Montague Summers can join him in Satan's personal chamber of torment. That is his price to pay for agreeing with all those witchburnings, hahaha. I'm glad he's dead. May he suffer in Hell 
 First off I belive that this would have been better if written by Greg Cox. Mr Hanna has probably only seen about 2 minutes of an episode because in this book he makes Sydney seem weak (which we all know she is not), He didn't really give the main Charater much to do since she had was injured and what got on my nerves the most was that he had Sydney call Vaughn "Michael" (which she NEVER does) and has people call Dixon "Marcus". For a second when I was reading the book I had to think of who this "Marcus" was. So overall this is a book that you can skip. You won't be missing anything.   
 Don't waste your time or money.   This book is full of hooey.  Pseudo-scientific drivel and an insult to serious economists everywhere. 
 As a former student of Ms. Morris, I will state that she and William Morris were quite emphatic about keeping the teachings sacred and authentic as taught by Grand Master Takata. Her history is to this day accurate 
 This book starts with an outright lie: George of Capadocia was murdered by a PAGAN mob. As bishop of Alexandria, he had done more to piss off pagans than anybody in the history of the Roman Empire. It was only after Julian had come out of the pagan closet that they felt safe enough to act against George. Athanasius' followers played a minimal part, if any, in that incident.   No contemporary sources attest to the manner of Arius' death. This supposedly was a story circulated by Athanasius decades after the fact, and then retold a few more decades later by historian Socrates. Anybody familiar with the depiction of Judas' death in the Book of Acts can see what Athanasius was getting at: Arius was another Judas. At the time of his death, Arius had long ceased being a player in church politics and his reinstatement was an act of charity to a forgotten old man, not a triumphant vindication. There was nothing to be gained by murdering him.   The author states that if a Council ever deserved to be called ecumenical it was that of Rimini-Seleucia. Hardly. If there was ever a Council that was rigged to produced a desired result (beginning with the idea of dividing it into two venues to better isolate Athanasius' followers), it was that of Rimini-Seleucia.  And so on. In this book so many creative liberties have been taken with the facts that it becomes impossible to tell what is conjecture and what is historical. Not to mention the absurd conflation of Adoptionist and Gnostic ideas being presented as Arianism by the author.  Other reviewers have pointed out the author is not a theologian or historian. Indeed, it is worse than that: he is a LAWYER. Lawyers are not trained to get at the truth. Lawyers are trained to win their cases by any "legal" means necessary. For whatever reason, the author seems to be out to destroy the reputation of the Christian witnesses and to discredit their testimony. You would never guess from this book that the Church during this period did a single positive thing.  Moreover, I think there is something disturbingly inappropriate about the publication of a book written by a person of a religious background which derisively speculates about another religion's origins. In the century before and the century after the birth of Jesus, Judaism was a battleground between different factions at least as brutal as the Christianity depicted by this author, if not worse. If I, a Christian, were to publish a book which speculated about the legitimacy of the Judaism which emerged from that struggle, I hope I would get severely criticized, to say the least. Maybe that's the book Mr. Rubinstein should have written instead.  I give this book one star to counter the high reviews it's been getting from readers who take it at face value as a source of Church history. The best advice to readers is to approach this book as one would the Da Vinci Code: a historical kernel lies somewhere within a liberally and creatively elaborated story. But if you want a real Church history which is well-balanced and easy to read, I recommend picking up Chadwick's "The Early Church" instead 
 Like what was stated earlier, I am an experienced windows system administrator w/ MCP status and this book leaves out some details. I like sybex but this one looks like it might have been rushed. I dont particularly care for the sybex CD's also. The questions were to easy for the actual Microsoft exams. Plus the chapter about optimizing Server 2003 left out some noticable details in how to optimize the page file. Its good for beginners but if you really want to know more and better prepare for this exam, read another book 
 Lee Child was due a dud, and whilst this may seem harsh I make the assessment based on the brilliant, dark atmopshere of his previous novels. To backcast his character into a now irrelevant world time zone, Child forced himself into a corner. I felt as he wrote this novel he wasn't entirely convinced himself that it was a great idea. The story itself lacked relevance in today's world - and instead of taking his character closer to the reality we live in today - he was placed in a rather dull backdrop - with a bit of a 'so- what' punchline. His previous novels bristle with a sense of anarchy in the modern world - but the Enemy did little to enhance the Reacher character. Instead he was a on a giddy, improbable merry go round, that was annoying in some parts. the additional subplot of his dying mother was material you could simply eliminate as it didn't resonate with the style of the book - which was effectively a murder mystery. The lead character - reacher - murdering one of the murder co-conspirators at the end, seemed a bit over the top, and didn't seem to fit with the usual sense of justice this character demonstrates. I only make these criticisms because I feel Child has set such a high standard with his writing - and has created a character and a world that is unique in popular fiction. So 9 or ten novels - and one bad one - is a pretty fine record, really.  
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.  The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly.  With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word "death" and the like.  Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew.  After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke. They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence.  The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.  Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as "Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as "Elizabethtown" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
 Maybe my expectations were too high.  This heating pad does not get hot enough; not nearly as hot as others I've used.  The massage feature is not effective and is simply two speeds of vibration  I bought this one because I was attracted to the thickness of the pad.  I've had problems with other heating pads bunching and folding up too much.  If this one only got hotter it would be nice; I don't really care about the massage feature.  My heating pad hasn't broken yet as the other reviewer experienced.  I'm still using it for now 
 I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash. 
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 God help me for disparaging Frank Zappa by mentioning him in describing this incomprehensible CD. Zappa had chops, Zappa had humor, Mr. Bungle has neither, though it appears they were influenced by him. It's weird without a purpose, highly unlistenable, and only marginally creative. It doesn't stir passion in the listener the way great (and even good) music does and should. The singer sounds like Jello Biafra on a bad day and the lyrics belong in the Non Sequitur Hall of Fame.  Highly unrecommended 
 Most of the 5 star reviews are from "customer" reviewers that have only reviewed her other books and given them 5 stars as well.   I did not read this book and will not based on this alone.  Pathetic 
 THIS COMPILATION FEATURES SOME OF THE WWE'S WRESTLERS PERFORMING THEIR OWN SONGS. AND JUST FOR THAT FACT ALONE, THIS CD IS DOOMED TO FAILURE. LET'S FACE IT, THESE GUYS CAN'T SING!!!!!! ONLY TRACKS THAT'RE EVEN WORTH LISTENING TO ARE THE DUDLEY BOYZ' ''WE'VE HAD ENOUGH'', JOHN CENA'S ''BASIC THUGANOMICS'', AND CHRIS JERICHO'S ''DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE ME''. EVERYTHING ELSE ARE JUST LAUGHABLE ATTEMPTS AT MAKING MUSIC. STONE COLD'S SKITS, WHICH ARE STUCK IN BETWEEN SONGS, ARE QUITE FUNNY. BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS STUPEFYINGLY BAD FOR MUCH OF IT'S RUNNING TIME, YOU COULD ALMOST SAY IT'S SO BAD THAT IT'S FUNNY. IF YOU LIKE WWE'S MUSIC, BUY ''THEMEADDICT'' INSTEAD. 
 I love the Butthole surfers but this one didn't do it for me.  Too spacy just to be spacy,  it doesn't make me go oh ya that's some cool music.  Independent worm saloon and Electric Larry Land are fantastic albums and one or two that i can't think of now.  But this one is a thumbs down from me 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Before getting steamed at the title of my review, take time and read my review in an objective sense. My critical anaylsis of this album was done strictly as objective as possible. I took my time listening to every single "song" on this album, so this isn't an uninformed review. Now to the review. ------------------------------------------------------------  Hell on Earth, Mobb Deeps third release, came out during the era of the media-fabricated and infamous east-coast-west-coast beef. Throughout the album, you get a sense that the artist where suffucated by the negative climate of the time. The songs and lyrics on this album, in every way, reflect that era. Starting off the album is a deep bass mixed with a dark-drum line instrumental. Havoc and Prodigy lace the beat with self glorifying, tough guy lyrics that accentuate the grimy instrumental. Though this album has 14 tracks, you've be hardpressed to differentiate one from the other if it wasn't for the switch of beat. The level of variation in subject matter on this album is so limited that a review of one tracks lyrics will tell you all you need to know about the album, lyric wise. There are little to no song concepts on this album. Nearly every single track on Hell on Earth is polluted with numerous references to someone getting shot, how much better Prodigy and Havoc are than you, and how they are from Queensbridge, etc. Through the lyrical context of this album, you almost get the sense that Mobb Deep was too consumed with the negative climate of rap at the time. You get the sense that they're lashing out at anyone and everyone that may pose as a potential threat to them. Cuts like "Drop a gem on them" and "Bloodsport" find them verbally attacking the late Tupac Shakur. The lyrics on this album get so rediculous at times that you have to wonder what these guys were thinking. You truely have to sit back and question how these guys could put out track after track of the same tired material. About the only saving grace of this album is the instrumentals. Dark, grimey, and horror movie like, they paint a background of horror and terror. Though good, the instrumentals of this album also start to sound repetitive as you get deeper into the album. After a while, they all start to sound like a cluster of the same stuff.  I'm sorry, but in no way shape or form is this as great of an album as some have stated. Lack of variation in topics, Ignorant, mindless gun and thug brovado give this album no depth. If you're someone that is looking for intelligent lyrics or creative concepts, do yourself a favor and avoid Hell on Earth at all cost 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 Lilly has always been the self-proclaimed feminist, but her influence on Mia definitely showed in this latest addition to the Princess Diaries series. Problem: Mia wants to attend the senior prom, but her boyfriend Michael doesn't want to, and it's only through him that she can go. Instead of considering what he wants, she whines and tries to subtly coerce him into going to the dance. She convinces her classmates to hire Michael's band to perform at the dance, further showing her true colors as it goes against even the band members' own wishes. The value she places on herself and her own desires, above the desires of others, is utterly selfish and disgusting. I strongly recommend NOT reading this book, it really made me dislike Mia as a character.  Why is the prom more important than respecting someone else's wishes? If Mia and Michael were so compatible, they wouldn't be split on this issue. From her insistence on the prom (which also seems uncharacteristic for her to want so badly), to the feminist view that men are oppressors and women shouldn't take their husbands' last names after marriage, Lilly's cold disregard for Boris' feelings and later hypocrisy over him and Tina, to the hateful quote that women need men like a fish needs a bicycle, and Mia's goal to "mold" her little brother into the perfect (read: pussified) boyfriend...shame on you, Ms. Cabot. You make masculinity something to be suppressed and ashamed of, when it should be revered.  Also, as some reviewers have said, 15 is a bit young to be exploring sexually, and it's illogical for Mia and Lilly to join in on such behavior. Since when does turning 15 equate with 'becoming a woman'? Kind of an odd thing to say 
 I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee.  I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again... 
 These phones do not work, they have a lot of static and the battery runs out quickly. Do not buy them!!! 
 Everyone who reviewed this piece o' crap 1 star had the right idea. Now, let me drive the point home further: this song is pathetic. Billy Joe should really quit whining about how he "walks alone". After all, Green Day is on top of the music world right now in spite of being a lame Nirvana retread. So sorry, but you don't walk alone. Maybe if he had the decency to admit he was only in it for the money, I wouldn't be so opposed to this song.  I've heard it said that this song has emotion. That's great...where? I know it's not in the bored way Billy Joe sings his uninspired, typical "Nobody-loves-me-even-though-I'm-also-a-rock-star-and-I-have-fans-on-the-other-end-of-the-world-but-becuase-I'm-a-sellout-I'll-sing-about-being-a-loser" lyrics. You want emotion? Listen to Bell Bottom Blues by Derek & the Dominoes. You can tell that Eric Clapton meant every word he said. With this annoying track, all you can tell is that Green Day is a highly overrated group. If they don't stop playing this song, and fast, I don't know what I'll  do. 
 I was happy at the appearance of the bag, but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack.  I received it around Christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell.  It still smells making it unable to use 
 When we watched this remake of Brian's Song, it was not by design. We had requested the 1971 version from Netflix, but the DVD was damaged in the mail and they resent the 2001 remake by mistake. But instead of sending it back again, we thought "what the hec, let's give it a chance." While we didn't expect it to live up to the beloved original, nothing could prepare us for how god-awful it was. So when we saw all the stars given to this remake, we were utterly mystified. Other than Mekhi Phifer's performance, which was pretty good, it was a joke. Sean's Maher's Brian Piccolo was a caricature; cartoony and over-the-top obnoxious. Maybe they had intended to cast Jim Carrey in the role but he was busy. Instead, they got Maher to do a Jim Carrey impersonation.  James Caan portrayed Piccolo as this outgoing, wise-cracking guy, but he was human and believable -- not a clown. And those football scenes. They looked ridiculous. At least in the original they used real game footage, which gave a real gritty sense of being in a stadium -- not at a high school or some sound stage. Even though the original was a TV movie, the performances, scenarios and dialog were well done, believable, touching, heartwrenching. If you watch it now is it dated? Of course, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is current to the time it depicts. But this remake reminds us of a very bad, melodramatic after-school special. Really, it was so bad I can't find adequate words to describe it 
 The many toubled, undemocratic areas of Africa don't have leaders that have sworn to stop at nothing until the United States is destroyed.  Whether or not he actually had the capability to do so, the leader of Iraq did so swear and he did lead the world to believe that he had such capability.  But thanks for commenting.  As for the film, I know it won a couple Oscars and all, but I just didn't like it.  I thought the editing was poor, that the scenes were long and often unnecessary.  Although the story was good, a modern director would have put it together a lot better 
 The commericial for this doll shows her swimming in water.  Now I wasn't crazy enough to believe that it could actually swim, but I did think the doll could be placed in water.  NOT!!111  My daughter was very disappointed that she couldn't play with it in the bath tub.  Also the dolls singing is annoying, you can't understand what she's saying 
 The Forgotten starring Julianne Moore and Domnic West is a slow, tepid, and hard to grasp film. The previews for this film were better than the actual movie, I guess that's a bad sign that the movie isn't going to be great (I'll try and remember that next time). The only reason I am giving The Fogotten 2 stars is the scene with Alfe Woodward, you'll know what I mean when it happens, the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere, very intrguing spurprise awaits. Anyways The Forgotten is a movie you should see once and that's it, happy viewing 
 I purchased this to replace the filter on my 04163 unit and although the description (and box) say it is compatible with this unit, it was the wrong size! I still don't know how to order the correct one 
 Jennifer Cox, a travel journalist decided to travel around the world in search of her soul mate. After having survived a breakup, Jennifer felt that she couldn't find someone in English worthy enough to spend the rest of her life wife, she contacted some friends from all over the world to set her up with a date whom they felt would be a good match for her. Those friends also let the word out and soon, Jennifer found herself having many many dates set up. She travelled to Asia, Europe and the U.S. in search of her soul mate.   The premise of the book was promising enough but unfortunately, the book was lacking in substance. It was interesting enough to read about her first ten dates but soon, as a reader, I found myself getting quite dull by her description of dates. Initially, I thought this was a travelogue and that the author would have provided information about the culture or the places that she was going to. Unfortunately, it consisted mostly of her whirlwind dating. In addition, there were hardly any plots as it was mostly, she travelled to a particular place to meet someone, she did subsequently, and the next day, travelled to another country for another date. It was definitely not engaging at all. 
 I had high hopes going into this book. I had learned of the "divine proportion" in a linear algebra class I'd taken and it inspired me to pick this book up.   In the beginning I wasn't surprised, Livio outlined so many amazing applications of phi that I couldn't wait to get into the more in depth explanations. However, once I had, it seemed to me that Livio was convincing me that It wasn't so "divine." In any other applications other than simple geometry phi fails at being anything miraculous. For instance, when attempted to apply it into aesthetics it's useless.   The only reason I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 is that it gives a great overview of the history of Phi, which I appreciated. Other than that, it at least convinced me that Phi is just another way of looking for a set universal design. However, after further thought you should realize that if it weren't there, another mathematical structure would be. Because if we're working with simple Euclidean geometry, we're bound to come up with the same answers when looking for proportions in geometrical shapes.  
 Denzel Washington is probably my favorite actor. Even in that dog of a movie called THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, he shone. Tom Hanks? Well, lemme quit hating the guy. This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a Latino, after all.   Actually, this is a Hollywood "message movie," and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as far away from it as possible.   There's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way they stared at him reminded me of "lao wei in China" experiences. Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks' character.   AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got.   As a totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name "Sam Francisco" means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on discrimination.   I love a great courtroom drama. This one was merely good. With so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film, they had to take a few shortcuts here. Sad, ain't it? But even so, a well-intentioned film that I'm glad I saw. Once. Not twice. Once is enough, thank you.    
 This is a film involving three stories about three women over three different periods in history. The first, with Marina Pierro is set in the Renaissance in Rome where she is the baker's daughter who sleeps with an artist. She double-crosses men in order to rake in some of the money that's flowing into the Papal coffers. The second story is about a girl who has an un-natural relationship with her rabbit, and then looses her virginity to a black man as he has her pressed up against a number of sheep in a pen in a slaughter-house. Not very tasteful. The third story hints at a woman having a close relationship with a dog that protects her from a number of men. Also distasteful 
 'Moving Target, The' is the first novel in which noir-American writer Ross McDonald introduces his most famous detective, Lew Archer. Published in 1948, in a time when noir movies was at the top, the book is just a unremarkable pulp fiction story with classic ingredients as murder, treason, much money, kidnapped and poor ladies in distress. When you read 'Moving Target, The' you feel that McDonald was very far to develop a strong and convincing work; in fact, most of the time the reader will feel the influence of some other authors hovering above Mc Donald's style. Great authors, to be sure, as Raymond Chandler, for instance. The story is just normal, and sometimes even full of flaws. But Archer is a good characther. In a way, his sympathy and easy way saves this book to be a complete misfire.  
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Although it looks very nice, this item is a failure. I found it to rust inside after about a month. Once rusted, no matter how you clean it, it will rerust. I have quite a few items from the "Naturewood" collection as it is our pattern and this item is one of the rare bad items 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 I was a member of the 1st Brigade, 2/502 Infantry, 101st Abn Division. From January thru December 1967.  I was assigned to B Company, 3rd platoon, the same platoon that manny garcia affirms to have been a part of during this time frame.  It is my opinion that manny garcia's book is full of deception and half truths.  Statements about our operations and jargon used in his book were positively NOT a part of our operations during 1967.  There are key events that occurred during 1967 that were not included in manny garcia's blurb.  This opinion is shared by myself and others who were actually in the platoon during this time frame.  To say that manny garcia's opus is nonfiction is an insult to the men of our platoon and to the University of New Mexico.  UNM editors are responsible for and in part share this fictionalized misstatement of a book 
 I think the target audience is somebody who completely missed out on the late nineties, but who would like a very light read to understand the change in openness and freedom in conversations that most folks now take for granted. There's not a lot of content here -- you can skim about 10% of the book and get seemingly 99% of the content. If you're really "clueless", hit the web version instead and save the effort of grabbing this book 
 While Malamud is without doubt a very skilled writer, I gave up attempting to read this book approximately 1/3 of the way through it.  The atmosphere of the book was overwhelmingly dour and depressing: story after story of loneliness, poverty, bleakness, bitterness, struggle, alienation from family.  It leaves one ready to jump off a bridge somewhere 
 ...and you know when a young man in full testosterone blow finds a film with a hottie like Milla in it to be an incomprehensible waste of time that it REALLY must be a stinker.  Not even worth renting, we saw this upchuck as a first run at Austin's legendary Alamo Drafthouse and walked out wondering why we had bothered.  I'd spare you that, if I could.     
 this thong only accentuates what you don't have down below 
 Unless you're extremely fluent in advanced mathematics, calculus, etc., this book is not for the faint of heart.  For those of us who never got past shop math - forget it.  The formulas and calculations are enough to knock you out or at least put you to sleep. I'll give it a re-read again, but first drive through, just blew me away - sorry, math was never my strong point! Overall - 2's the best this rates for non-mathemeticians 
 Now, I agree with about 80% of the things the author is skeptical about.  I mean, I don't believe in them too.  However, the hair starts to go up on the back of my neck when yet another Western white guy dismisses every cultural belief that is not his.  The definitions of many items discussed are not even remotely correct too.  It reminds me of when a born again Christian rips apart every single world religion because they know the "truth."  What are you supposed to gather from this, that all indigenous people and other cultures are stupid because they aren't backed by a US drug company? Acupuncture is really a dangerous delusion?  That gets real old.  It's a little 1860 pioneer type thinking to me.  I think if I were actually interested in a topic such as Chinese medicine I may rather go to better sources than one Western guy's 2 paragraph dismissive definition.  Kudos to the author, it must be nice to know absolutely everything about absolutely everything and be able to discard it all in favor of Western thought in one book. ; 
 I love this film.  It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing.  I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used.  I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches.  In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture.  I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves.  I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print .  One of  the worst I've ever seen 
 I bought this on the recomendation of someone concerning a technical question I had on Video signalling over SDI. It turned out to have about 1 paragraph on the subject, and didnt come close to being able to answer my question.  Having worked on Computers for around 20 years including writing and debugging mainframe assembler code, as well as many a day spent searching though page after page of hexadecimal, I am no stranger to bits and bites, and large libraries of thousands of technical reference manuals.  I have 3 problems with this book.  1) The title is deceiving. A more accurate title would be "Primer for decoder/encoder design" or "Video Signaling Reference Guide".  2) It cetainly does no "Demystifying". I expected a book that was structured and had a flow to it (as any educational book should) but found it to be written with absolutely NO PERSONALITY (like a reference book), and using terms at the start that then only actually get explained half way through the book!  3) There are so many tables and figures (overkill IMHO used too much to fill pages rather than explain anything well) with very little descriptions, and no keys to the diagrams. 90% of them also seem to be referred to by text many pages away from the actual graphics, which is just bad book design.  I am sure that the author really knows his stuff, and the book is full of very useful refrence information for designers, but for someone looking for an educational book on Video, you should look elsewhere, unless you have a fulltime engineer to sit with you as you read the book.  I can only recomend this as a reference book for those who already have a very good grounding in this field, or to be used in conjuction with another higher level book written by someone with much better educational skills.  
 This book was purchased as the result of an over-hyped online promotion and it was a big disappointment. You can easily spend your money better 
 The book is easy to follow, and can help a non-programmer pick up the basics.  The problem is in the code examples.  The code examples in this book all compile, and the binaries run, but if you enable warnings on your ANSI-compliant compiler before compiling any of this code, you will see a whole host of warnings and error messages.  Don't think that you will learn C from this book and then go get a job somewhere as a C programmer.  Your code will be as non-ANSI compliant as it could possibly be while still working.  This makes it even more difficult if you progress to a more advanced C text after this, as you will likely have to go back and relearn quite a bit.  I give it 5 stars for ease of use, but it loses 3 stars for not "teaching good programming practices" as it claims to on the cover 
 I saw Dead Ringers in the movies. The theater was filled with mostly couples. When it was over, as we walked out, laughter began to spread as we all recognized that we as couples were having the same conversation; "Whose stupid idea was it to pay money to see this move"! 
 This book was such a huge disappointment. Having experienced the good and bad sides of mommy cliques, I thought the idea of this book was so great and I was really looking forward to reading it.  Unfortunately, this wasn't a funny and inspired take on the "insanity of motherhood" at all.  It was a judgmental and mean-spirited attack on what seemed to be as many women as the author could think of.  I had to force myself to finish it, and only did so in the hopes that it would somehow redeem itself in the end (it didn't).  Each "character" in the book is an extreme caricature of a real person, snarkily drawn around whatever characteristic they might have that offends the author (ie is different from her beliefs about mothering).  This is especially ironic because her main complaint about many of these women is that they are not accepting of those who are different from themselves.  Yet, that is exactly how the author appears to the reader - as completely unwilling to look for the good in people who might not be exactly the same type of mother as she is.  All of the mothers in my moms club and playgroups share some of the traits the author scorns in this book, but none of them are such cartoonish people as the characters in her books.  And none of them are so quick to judge and find others lacking as are her denizens of Mommy Land (and as she appears to be herself, based on her scathing portrayals of the women in her book).  It's so sad to think of everyone being labeled, categorized, and marked off as unworthy of friendship or respect just because they happen to feel differently than you do about breastfeeding, Bugaboos, or bedtime crying.    As a side note, I was astonished to see so many typographical errors in such a short book.  Although the book is barely 1/4" thick and only took an hour to read, I lost count of all the errors and mistakes; it seems as if there was no editor or proofreader at all.    If you really want to give this book a chance, check it out from the library so you can put your money towards a higher quality title.  Hopefully that way you won't feel as cheated as I did!  
 I recorded this from TV, and tried to watch it.  I even tried to just watch a little each day, to see if there was anything remotely funny in it. I finally gave up yesterday, and erased it. I actually felt sorry for Peter O'Toole, that he had to do the unfunny things he had to do in this movie. Life is too short to sit through this thing. Amazing that some people think it's great. Unbearably bad 
 There isn't a fact or bit of advice in this poorly written book that you can't easily find and read on the Net for free. Written by yet another patient that thinks she can write and has something to say 
 This video was not very interesting.  Neither Pamela Anderson nor Charlie Sheen can act their way out of a paper bag.  Although Pamela has her physical attributes to her credit, they can't carry the video.  This was my first venture into the Scary Movie set and it probably will be my last.         
 I'm frankly a little surprised to see so many positive reviews of this book.  I was intrigued by the story at the beginning, but as it unfolded, the characters seemed more and more wooden and the dialogue became laughable.  If I had to hear Mrs. Weber call her daughters "my little fleas" one more time, I vowed to stop reading.  I finally ended up skimming the last 50 pages to end my misery, as I really didn't care what happened to the shallow characters.  I think Stephanie Cowell has the potential to be a good descriptive writer, but somehow this story fell painfully flat.  Kudos to her for the underlying idea, which was a creative approach to telling the tale of Mozart.  I would not, however, recommend this book to those who desire a more lyrical--and believable--read 
 It's amazing that this much acting talent could be shoe-horned into such a bad movie.  I don't see how it could have yielded six 5-star reviews (The Godfather it ain't).  Using its better scenes, you could put together a trailer for this movie that would make you want to see it.  And you may be entertained through much of the movie.  But when the story becomes quite nonsensical in the final minutes of the movie, you will feal cheated and wish that you had watched something else.  At least that's how everyone in my family felt when we watched it 
 This book is just poor.  The information is just light weight, the suggestions on how to sell yourself will make you come across as either an amateur or scam artist.  What should be the most important section on contracts is severely lacking.  This book is not for people who are actually serious about going into contracting 
 this not a terrible album, but it is not that good either, and this, when  coupled with the fact that there are many other bands doing very similar  things much better than knapsack, means that it probably isn't worth the  investment. i have never heard any of their other albums, but this one had  neither wonderful guitar work nor intriguing vocals, and the lyrics (which  have been called brilliant by one of the official reviewers) leave  something to be desired. the first time you hear this album, you will  probably like it, but after three or four more times all the way through, i  think you will probably be either skipping half the songs, taking the album  out after three songs, or running to your local used cd store to get some  of your poorly invested money back. it just doesn't have that lasting  quality that a great album has; this album does not leave you wanting more,  as a brilliant album would do. in short, not a terrible album but not worth  paying full price for, especially when there are so many bands out their  which are doing the whole emo-punk-pop thing much better 
 This movie is a bit new fantasy. They go waaayy beyond reinventing a story. Still... Garbo does a nice acting job. Too bad they didn't thought it would be neccisary to dy her hair black like Mata Hari was in real life.   The movie is still a good classic... but don't take it as history.   Mata Hari... the Legend [... 
 i'm tired of all these bands that come out and they think they sound good. this is another example of how dumb music is sometimes. RJA has copied every other band i've heard of and i'm sick of that. "Face Down" is there first single and it sounds like a rip of MXPX. so yeah not even that song.  "Guardian Angel" or whatever sounds like Copeland, or Lifehouse or something like that. i mean every song on the cd is a copy of other bands. no originality what so ever. i wish bands that are trying to make it big use their own skills in writing instead of others. one star is the least i could do, and that's sad cause i enjoy music, don't waste your time on this cd 
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.   The setting is the same as the first book, an alternate mid-1980s England in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation. Fresh off the events of "The Eyre Affair", Thursday Next (a police officer specializing in literature related crimes, such as first-edition forgeries, valuable manuscript thefts, and the like) is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre (and changed the ending for the better), when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband Landen. Unfortunately, the evil Goliath Corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the Chronogaurd (timestream police) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage. In the first book Thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside Poe's "The Raven", and it seems they want him back.   This a potentially interesting plot, but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things Fforde throws into the mix. Most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday (and are also linked to events in the first book). Another plotline concerns the discovery of a "lost" Shakespeare play, which looks to be the most important literary event of the century, if Thursday can authenticate it. There's also the small matter of Thursday's pregnancy. And just when one is comfortable with Thursday's role as a "SpecOps Litratech", and that whole milieu, she's thrown into an entirely new one as a member of "Jurisfiction", a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in different literary works and maintain order... Finally, her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone wrong and the entire world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a few days unless he can figure it out, and can she help him. Phew!  I've probably missed one or two elements, but you get the idea. Fforde is just brimming with nifty ideas, but the shame of it is that he can't stop and give any of them the attention they deserve. It's impossible to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he's just going to move on to something else in a few pages, and it's impossible to care about the characters when their existence is utterly malleable, as is time and place. I suppose it's all meant to be puckish good fun, but the overall effect is more an attention deficit disorder Nancy Drew heroine meets a poor-man's Douglas Adams. The book has its occasional moments, but the humor is far too broad and unsubtle, and there's absolutely no narrative tension. All the literary in jokes in the world can't save this shambling wreck, and I don't think I'll be moving on to the next book. 
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 Since this is one of my top four all-time favorite films and I love films passionately, I am ABSOLUTELY beside myself in fury and anger at the HORRIBLE packaging on this magnificent film. I could forgive the lack of extras. I know A LOT of people working for these international movie conglomerates don't give a damn about the Classics (or even movies in general, really). But the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great, PERFECT, scene-by-scene-, shot-by-shot, movie is STAGGERING. Not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images, not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring... they picture the villianess, not the heroine, with the hero ! Where is the original poster art !!!!! THe insert art !!! The half sheet art !!! The reissue art !!! There . isnt . even . a . booklet . . or . flyer . inside . NOTHING ! This looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff . Columbia Pictures.. I am shouting . At . YOU  
 of stupidity! smoke on the water have the most stupid guitar rif of the rock history, boring boring boring, but if you like it ok 
 This came out when I was 12: it would have been far too 'difficult' an album for a young whippersnapper and I was only vaguely aware that the Bunnymen existed at that time. In my early teens I bought a few Bunnymen singles and Ocean Rain; now, 24 years later, I'm trying to fill in the rest of the Bunnymen jigsaw.   After a week of repeated listening, I'd say you can try on this album in either of two ways. Either, you judge it by its stand out songs, which are far and few between: if you can listen half a dozen times and manage to hum more than 2 tunes afterwards, you're doing better than me.   Alternatively, you can put it in context: appreciate that this was a pretty original approach at the time and marvel at the uncanny proto-U2 sound, (which I have to say does precious little to endear it to me). If you're interested in exploring music history largely for its own sake, it's worth hearing in order to understand how we got from Joy Division to U2 within a couple of years. However, if like me you think both Joy Division and U2 are vastly overated, this really isn't going to do much for you.   It's determindly bleak, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but this also captures the Bunnymen at a stage before they got a knack for melody: only 'Over the Wall' and 'A Promise' deliver a decent hook. I've seen Heaven Up Here described as a work of 'rare beauty'. It can also cause a tense, nervous headache.  If you're interested in the early 80's British underground scene, then of course you should hear it, along with the other Bunnymen albums. Compared to the lush Scott Walker-esque Ocean Rain, though, this is half-baked and less than half-rewarding. 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 I always read the reviews before I purchase but didn't.  I sure wish I would have!  I have just tried many links listed.... finally the last one worked but everything on the site cost $$$$.  Don't waste your $$ 
 If you are a christian reading this book for REAL information about paganism or wicca, then in all fairness you should also include another book in your studies, The Truth About Witchcraft by Scott Cunningham.  Scott was a practicing wiccan and his economically priced little book is an overview about the myths and untruths surrounding this earth-based religion.  I believe that if you want information about a religion it is only fair to include a description of the religion from someone who practices it.  I am not saying that you shouldn't read a book about wicca simply because it is written by a christian, but keep in mind that Tim Baker is writing from the christian perspective and apparently does not truly understand wicca, witchcraft or satanism.  This is obviously not a definitive source for information and tells only one side of the issue.  PLEASE don't get all of your information from one side; in order to truly understand wicca, you need to go to an authority on wicca.  
 I bought the movie on accout Rose was on the cover. I got home and watched and in the end I was disappointed and in tears. This movie is not for people under eighteen cause of some of the stuff she doe 
 I tested the Cobra hand held CB on California Rt. 99 today.  Not so good.  Tuned into truckers' channel 17 (for North-South traffic) and heard mostly noise.  There was very little discernible language so I squelched out the noise and waited...and waited.  I called out for a radio check and got a comeback--loud but not clear.  The speaker in that hand held CB is awful.  It's abrasive to listen to.   It is my opinion that the short 10 inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speaker.   This CB radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road.  Perhaps a longer whip antenna in the roof mount along with a better quality extension speaker will make the system less annoying.  I was looking for a portable system for temporary use, but the Cobra HH Road Trip CB is pretty poor.  Personally, I wouldn't buy it again 
 In wandering around the web, I find I am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing (from Photoshop Elements 5).  When importing, Lightroom "thinks" for a long time (that's fine, and they do warn you it can be slow), but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import. About the rest of the program?  I don't know.  Too frustrated just trying to get it up and running. 
 I had high hopes for this guide, since it is basically the only one and the previous version is out of date.  But this version is no different.  The length of the practice tests is not the same as what the actual tests will be.  I have not yet taken the written exam, but if the foreign service's website is any guide (and one would think it would be), the questions that this book asks are not representative of what is on the actual exam.  But worse yet, there are TYPOS in the practice tests, including in what the book judges to be correct answers. These typos are such that, on some questions, it is impossible to determine the "correct" answer because they are all wrong (and then if you look in the answers, you see what they actually meant to print).  And these were the same mistakes as in the previous edition!  Did they even try to improve it?  I am very disappointed. (Incidentally, the tests are all the same as the previous edition, so don't bother getting this book for extra practice.)  You're better off sticking to the FSO website 
 I love the way the phone looks and feels but that's about it.  From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone I've ever owned.  I've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise.  
 I regret to say that this is not a good accompaniment for my graduate macroeconomics class.  I thought I could somehow get some mileage out of this book, but as I read it I found out that its lack of technical details and rigor make my lecture notes look superior. I was misled to think that this is a great textbook through the early positive reviews below, that's why I bought it.  Nevertheless, the empirical content is more than enough to satisfy one's curiosity, but I think it is not worthwhile to study advanced macroeconomics without learning fully the necessary theories and the accompanying mathematical techniques.  This textbook must not be the choice for a core graduate level macroeconomics class; it's wordiness is comparable to the undergraduate textbook "Intermediate Microeconomics" text by Varian.  It is readable of course, when you want to pass the time, but it won't do for a graduate level text.  I'm disappointed because this is the second edition already but still the author stuck to the same way of presentation.  Perhaps the only differences between the first and the second edition are the empirical data sets and a new chapter and nothing else.  The first three chapters and chapter 7 of Obstfeld and Rogoff's treatise, "Foundations of International Macroeconomics," Barro and Sala-i-Martin's, "Economic Growth," and the chapters 2,3 and 4 of Blanchard and Fischer's, "Lectures in Macroeconomics," provide a more comprehensive view of modern acroeconomics 
 I'll preface this by saying I'm a cryer.  I cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining.  I cried all the way through Superman Returns.  I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle.  In English class, I always learned to "show, not tell" when writing.  When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful.  Sparks is the master of telling without showing.  I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets.  The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff.  But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), "He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer.  After opening it, he sat down on the back deck."  Or, "Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table."  "She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt."  Have you read enough yet?  I'm new to the romance genre.  My mother-in-law recommended Sparks because -- I think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic.  They were to me, but then, I'm new to romance, and spoiled by the masterful, unequaled storytelling skill of Stephen King.  Please hold your New York Times bestsellers to a higher standard.  Let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music, movies, and literature 
 This album does have one REALLY good song, which is the opening track, "FREE CITY RHYMES".. it's really excellent. and this album does have good lyrics. the song "Side2Side" is kind of interesting, and the title track is okay to listen to once. But mostly it's just a disc full of half-spoken poetry over uninspired music, which is disappointing. Like everyone said, thankfully MURRAY STREET and NURSE were a LOT better. but definitely check out FREE CITY RHYMES, it's actually good, i promise 
 I was assigned this book for a graduate level substance abuse class at the seminary I attend.  I found the content quite shocking.  If you are a Christian, you should know that this book is probably not what you think.  May's theology will be strange to anyone who considers the Bible to be God's Word.  The beliefs that May lays out are a hodge-podge of Freudian psychodynamics, eastern religious traditions, Christianity, and gnosticism.   May's foundational premise is that human beings are basically good and that addictions subvert our goodness and redirect what he believes is our innate desire for God.  That is certainly contrary to the testimony of Scripture.    If you are looking for another secular humanistic treatise on addictions you will likely love this book. If you are looking for a Biblical treatment of addictions, you won't find what you are looking for here.  I would recommend Ed Welch's book, "Addictions: A Banquet in the Grave".  
 Not to put too fine a point on it but this book is DRY - almost like a text book.  There is very little action and/or suspense brought forth about involvement in the Angola operation and what could have been was quickly blunted with operational and bureaucratic detail.  And that's how the book drags on, with excruciating detail. In one part, Mr. Stockwell describes what he did to finally get a desk to work from at Langley by sitting in the hall in everyone's way and stacking his papers up beside him.  What took him pages to describe should've been done in a simple paragraph.  To be fair, the book is written from the viewpoint of an intelligence staffer not a cloak and dagger operative. Yes, there might be some interest in how inefficient the CIA was operating back in the mid-1970s but that's true for most large government organizations. He also describes some of the "political" machinations between officials within the CIA.  Again, mildly interesting but nothing notable. Some of the descriptions of dialog and reactions of persons seems contrived, almost as if he (or some ghost writer) added these things for effect. It almost "reads" like a fiction novel in that respect. Rather than writing a solid, crisp account with thoughtful and concise opinions about CIA policy and inner workings the book devolves often times into monotonous detail. However, in the latter chapters the account does get more interesting as he discusses "plausible deniability" and the deception of the CIA to "hide" their involvement. One of the more interesting parts is the organizational background and resources needed to run an operation of this type including the shipping of weapons and ammo, the propaganda strategy, the political workings thru committees, the State Department and the President to gain support, etc.  The book does makes one wonder what other rebellions or conflicts the CIA was involved in over the last 30-40 years and is an eye opener about our nations espionage policies. On this level, the book succeeds.  But, in the end the book was almost a grind to finish.  I'd only recommend this one for the hard core 'spook' fan 
 This is an extremely important topic, and it is interesting (even intriguing) to read Sanders' and Fackre's atypical views on this subject.  However, Nash does not make a positive case -- WHICH IS EXTREMELY  FRUSTRATING!  Both Fackre and Sanders readily express their frustration  with it, which can only lead the reader to exasperation.  If you want to  engage this issue, check this book out only for its bibliography.  You also  may want to read Fackre's argument as it is intriguing and well-written --  you'll never read First Peter again quite the same way.. 
 I brought this book because of its high rating. It is just a disappointment.   1. It is too wordy -- Key opinion can be summarized in 10 pages.  2. Too much irreverent topics - only the first 100 pages is about adwords. The rest of 200 is irreverent.  3. Nothing new - you may learn more if you search "adwords trick" in google.   
 If a "suspense" filmed was played in the woods, and it didn't actually contain any suspense, would a bear watch it?   The previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making "Domestic Disturbance", the newest `thriller' starring John Travolta, Vince Vaughn and Teri Polo.   Let's talk for a few minutes about Mr. Travolta. Can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them? I think that Travolta has now surpassed Richard Dreyfuss as the comeback/ lose it again king. After a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer Quentin Tarantino in "Pulp Fiction", Travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices. "Face/Off" and "Broken Arrow" highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed Travolta to join the $20 million club. In the last few years, every film Travolta has appeared in has failed miserably. "Lucky Numbers"? "The General's Daughter"? That film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it? "Swordfish"? Interesting, but a flop. "Battlefield Earth"? Why does he keep making this trash? It has to be the paychecks. I can't see any other conceivable reason. John, baby, how long before the studios realize that these films aren't making any money and they stop hiring you? John, baby, how long before you need another comeback vehicle?   Frank Morrison (John Travolta) is a divorced father who makes wooden boats. He doesn't get a lot of business, but the business that he does get gets a great deal. He doesn't charge his customers enough to make a profit. Frank does this because HE IS THE GOOD GUY. His son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary) has a lot of problems accepting his mom's (Teri Polo) new relationship with Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). He gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone. A couple of days after his mom and Rick get married, he stows away in Rick's car and witnesses him murdering a business associate. The police don't believe him however. After a little soul searching, Frank believes his son. He may lie to everyone, but he doesn't lie to Frank.   Directed by Harold Becker ("Sea of Love"), "Domestic Disturbance" is a suspense film without any suspense. From the moment Danny stows away in Rick's car and WATCHES HIM MURDER Ray (Steve Buscemi), which we also watch, we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is. To make matters worse, Frank instantly believes his son, which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between Frank and Rick. A boring cat and mouse game. When you know the identity of the villain, a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet. When Frank believes Danny early on, the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it.   The film would've been greatly improved by showing Danny in the backseat of the car, watching everything, the pain and suspense registering on his face, while the audience sees nothing. Then, when Danny tries to convince his dad, the police chief, his mom, that Rick is a murderer, at least we haven't seen the act, and we would require some convincing as well.   Because the filmmakers chose to show us everything, the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have Frank doubt Danny, his son. However, after a very brief segment, Frank believes Danny, causing us to watch a battle between Frank and Rick, which isn't very interesting.   Each of the actors, including Travolta, are serviceable in their roles, but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes, the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium.   Skip "Domestic Disturbance". It isn't even worthy of a video rental. Go to see the far superior and very different "Amelie" or "The Man Who Wasn't There". Your money will be much better spent. 
 This book has some good information but you have to wade through the fat to get at it.  It may be written mainly for aspiring college students, but I feel it is not complete enough or deep enough for parents.  There are many other better books out there on the subject (notably Fiancial Aid for Dummies and Discounts and Deals at the Nations best 360 colleges) 
   First, I know this review looks too long, but it might help you out. So please, read on.  I read a few of the "chapters" (exercise sections) of this book and found it to be a little too conversational. Sure, we all value a charming and witty instruction book to a dry academic one, but I still think she brings nothing new to this genre of book.    It seems like she could easily have gotten all of these ideas from other writing books, seminars and articles, and frankly, most of them are better written than this one. You've probably encountered most of the ideas put forth in this book, beginning with an intro akin to:    "Oh, we all say we're going to write, but we never get around to it. Well never, fear, because [insert generic writing guide book title] is here to kick your rear in gear!"    Something like that.     There are really so many different types of books, kits, articles, memoirs, classes and manifestos on the subject of writing, exercises, inspiration and so forth. (Just do a search on Amazon for Writing Instruction or Writing for Publication.)  I really can't recommend this book, though.      Unfortunately, the author also thinks it's cute or somehow necessary to write quite a few words in ALLCAPS to add emphatic notice to the concept. Personally, I think that WRITING like THIS every few PAGES looks unprofessional and can be quite IRRITATING. This stylistic flaw alone makes me wonder whether she's a very credible source. Is font manipulation creative? Sure, to an extent, but "all-caps" serves no purpose, and it's easy to do and banal.     I think that this work misses a point about writing: it requires self-discipline as well as inspiration and talent. It's easy and sometimes fun to get caught up in books like these, but really, if you just read a varity of nonfiction, novels and periodicals for a few hours each week you can begin to understand observational skills, and you won't need these silly little exercises.  You'll be inspired by what you read, and how the articles or whatever you read remind you of your own experiences.    So, the point is, if you feel that you need to spend money on a book like this, perhaps you don't have the ability to discipline yourself into a steady routine of journaling and writing. Buying a book like this one will allow you to read some tips and eventually forget about it. After brief excitement and productivity, you'll be back to square one; with no self-discipline, you'll never apply this book to your life week-by-week as you should. It will collect dust next to your yoga books.  I offer this criticism not to sound nasty, but to make you think about what you are buying.   It's simple to buy a Men's Fitness magazine, for instance, but it won't help you unless you actually work out routinely. Same thing.   I guess the bottom line is that this book is okay for a casual read, but look it over in a bookstore first to see if you really want to pay the price of owning it.   I give it about 2.4 stars. 
 If you can possibly avoid it, don't buy this book.  If you can't possibly avoid it, remember to use the internet.  The internet is 3000 times better at things than this book is.  Also, realize that even the problems in this book have continuous typos so if your TA grades you as wrong, check to make sure you are doing the same problem their solution book solved.  I wish we could rate this book without a star 
 What ever happened to common sense? In this book the average American doesn't exist. I am not denying the problems that exist in the inner cities. I am denying that this is life for the average American or even the average non-white American. Comparing two extremes - best case vs. worst case is always going to give you an unrealistic picture. We live in a capitalist economy, there will always be haves and have-nots. What he is pushing for is a socialist or communist system where everyone is equally miserable and those that manage to get ahead are then forced to pay the way for those who can't or won't. Hey Mr. Kozol - last time I checked there was no army on the borders of Camden or East St. Louis keeping people from moving out, and there is noone forcing anyone to accept the lifestyle they were born into. He offers a view of the problems with no real solution except maybe to hate the rich - Mr. Kozol, how much money did you get paid to write this book?? Utter liberal garbage. Conveniently leaves most of American schools totally out of the equation, only focusing on the worst cases and then comparing them to the top schools in the nation. 
 I am being generous giving this thing a star, it's more like -10 stars!! By far, the absolute worst toy I've ever bought!!  I paid $19.99 for this piece of garbage.  Within 5 hours of setting it up it collapsed permanently.  No bottom to support it.  It has these silly plastic tubes that you put over both door ways (supposedly to support it) and those were broken in less than 24 hours.  The wire that holds up the tent is very flimsy and bends easily so almost instantly my kids bent it out of shape and once that is done the thing won't stand up.  Four years ago we bought a plastic Hello Kitty tent at a yard sale for a dollar and a friend gave us the plastic house shaped frame for it and that thing lasted years, I was expecting too much from this one I suppose.  Makes me mad since I paid retail for the dumb thing.  DON'T BUY THIS TOY UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO THROW AWAY!!!  YOURS WILL SOON TURN TO GARBAGE LIKE MINE DID!!!  ABSOLUTE TRASH!!  Before purchasing this for my son for Christmas he was really into making forts, so I set up a card table and gave him 2 old sheets and some pillows and blankets for the inside and he was a happy camper, thought this would add to his enjoyment since it was Spider-Man!!!  I will be throwing Spiderman OUT and setting up the card table again!!  AND I REPEAT....DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS ON THIS ONE!! 
 i call this and all the other rap music trash along with the rappers. anyone who calls this stuff music and likes it needs to get a life. once you heard 1 song you have heard them all.  
 I was very disappointed in Nikon's service.  This camera has a 2in LCD display that apparently is very fragile.  When I returned for service, Nikon claimed I dropped it... which I didn't!  I was very careful in handling this camera, but the fragile LCD still broke.  To be blamed by the manufacturer was really disappointing.  They offered to repair it for $210, nearly the price of a new camera.    I will NEVER by a Nikon product again.  If they are going to sell such a fragile product, they should at least include a hard case for it. 
 The charming 1977 musical is not the subject of this note.  The show is great and the liner notes are superb. However, consumers should note that there is a critical flaw in the mastering (at least on the disc version that I obtained). It is very unfortunate that the manufacturers did not pull this mis-mastered version from the market. As noted elsewhere (and absolutely correct), an entire track of sound is lost and can only be heard distantly in the background.   If the problem is corrected and later discs are OK, it just compounds the problem with no way to know if you have a flawed disc or an OK disc. A most unfortunate problem for what should be a joyous recording 
 My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event! 
 I bought this book as a gift for someone else, and was very disappointed in the content and quality of the book once it arrived.  The book appears to advertise using one particular kind of tofu, which may or may not be widely available.  I was uncomfortable giving it to someone who may not be able to buy that brand in their local store.  The perils of online shopping, I guess 
 While better than her last 2 books--more rooted in objectivity, perception--here too Graham is so mannered that she cariacatures herself relentlessly; she is, at this stage in her labored career, pure cartoon. One is reminded of Gardner's Faults of the Soul, & cannot help wonder if these poems are the ultimate Frankenstein wrought by the factory poetry system of the MFA: a poetry of preciousness, of hyper-articulated stylistic/typographical *ticks* employed in the hopes of masking a shortfall of intellectual courage & spiritual discovery. If looking to have the top of your head taken off, turn to Hillman or Carson, Brock-Broido or Bidart. The most radical thing Graham could do at this point in her life's arc would be to embrace a decade or so of silence, to not publish every self-reflexive utterance. The other worthy task, one senses,would be to abandon all the stylistic bric-a-brac & hiccuping in favor of language itself, to *dare* to be direct, centered in image, lyric in intent 
 Some interesting dialogue sprinkled about within a mostly nonsensical, dull, and slow plot.  Also, the whole thing is in Swedish with hard to read English subtitles.  Blah.  The film critics will love this one because it gives them bizarre, convoluted material upon which to ponder self-importantly.  It's really not worth pondering, though.  
 A book of words and dubious references by "experts".  I cannot find any important educational references in this book.  As an expert in the field of Natural Medicine this is one book I would NEVER use 
 Bill Bryson's zest for life is made manifest in the books he's written on pretty much whatever catches his interest.  This admirable quality has resulted in quite a lot of enjoyable reading, as he's educated himself on distant places, science, etymology and such, and produced books about them.  This one, sadly, is disappointing.  It is a rote run-through of American history, of the "cherished myths debunked" school of history writing from the Sixties. He's read his Howard Zinn, and it shows.  This dated approach is too, well, too dated to give the expected pleasure to this new Bryson fan.  Politics intrudes most in the final chapters.  For instance, the pages on the Cold War could have been used to introduce a lot of useful terms, such as "peacenik", "peace offensive", and "red diaper baby."  But the liberal Bryson instead renders the contest with Communism as an idiotic greedfest for big business, and dwells on military double-speak from the Vietnam war.  More oddly, he defends the early 1990s wave of political correctness, and its assault on the language he professes to love.  Tepid, euphemism-ridden, colorless, and self-pitying pc-speak was never an invention of humorists, as he claims at one point, though it was satirized in a couple of books he claims are the source of the outrage.  Strange...  Hey, some books should best be left to the pros.  Simple as that 
 While this book is not an utter garbage, there's nothing remarkable about it either, at least in my opinion. There's a certain wit and charm to "Fat Girls...", but that in itself doesn't save it from being mediocre. Even though miss Peck says that she's not a professional writer, by any means, it still feels as if though you need be a part of her family in order to enjoy this book. There's no humor in here, despite whatever reviews are saying - its just a number of observations on life, good ones at that, but I was looking for something else.  Bonus points for an excellent books cover. 
 I have enjoyed reading Family Fun Magazine, but unfortunately have only received 2 issues.  I have not received any further magazines and am completely disappointed in the service.  I will not order another magazine from Amazon because of this poor service.  I tried to get a refund and have only gotten the run around.  
 ...I really didn't like this book.  I read alot of the success/motivational type books (see my reviews of various Brian Tracy books, for example) but I really had a hard time with this book.  The constant character catchphrases (see the title of this review), the "harrumphs", and I really thought the whole blue vase thing was kind of dumb.  Why not give the poor guy a test that might actually enhance the company's bottomline, rather than tempt him to break a window  in order to steal A STUPID BLUE VASE THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?  Why not send him after an impossible to get customer or something?  At least it was better than "Who Moved My Cheese? 
 Lived by the sea. Ok--that is how creative this book i 
 it may not be that common.  Not that I am being demanding or exceptionally critical, however, the author himself did admit that people nowadays had become so sophisticated that he or she could manipulate his/her own body language that the real meaning behind many of the movements/gestures discussed in the book should be judged by the readers themselves. If that's the case, what's the value of this book then? The content of it is just too simple, if not sometimes naive. I am sorry that I had made a mistake for buying and reading this book.  For those who want to study about body language, "Never be lied to again by David J. Lieberman" is a much better choice. For those who want to improve their knowledge on courtship and dating, "How to make anyone fall in love with you by Leil Lowndes" will satisfy you well.     
 I have many problems with this book.  I am indeed a fan of Celine Dion's, yet, I feel too many meaningless boring books have been written about her life.  I am not a huge Dion fan yet I have read most of the English texts on her life.    I am not farmilar with who this author is  and I do not understand why he goes on and on about his education, his affiliation with Dion, and the work he put into his self proclaimed "Best website ever on the singer".  This indeed does not sell the book, it only builds up to what I have found to be a pointless factual boring book.  This book is great if you are interested in chart performance and album sales.    If you are looking for a great read on Dion's life stick with the Authorized Biography or the book that Dion wrote herself, much more entertaining.  This book is much hype and leaves the reader totally dissapointed and confused about why they purchased it.  Please don't waste your money!  I feel this book is a product of some type of twisted obsession and it's almost like this person thinks Dion owes him something because he simply created a website for her????  Did that make her the global superstar she is today?? I think not!  Yet, he has used her name and image to further his own projects and has made money off Dion's name.  This book is no better than the other trash that has been written about the singer.  Please, don't waste your money 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 First, this piece of trash is based on The Journey To The West about as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on the Bible. There are some characters common to both Lost Empire and Journey. Well, common in name. That said let's get to the real problem with this film. It is astoundingly insulting to Chinese religious traditions. Imagine for a moment some non-Christian producing a film in which: the God Jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to Satan; Jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power; and the Virgin Mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars. Sound offensive? It is. And this film is equally insulting to Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism (the three big ones in China). Confucius, a man revered these past 2500 years for his uncompromising moral standards appears in Lost Empire as a lecherous,traitorous,lying,cowardly weasel. The Jade Emperor,Taoism's chief God, is shown as a despondent,apathetic slob who no longer cares about the earthly or celestial realms. Kuan Yin, one of the Bodhisattvas, is shown in Lost Empire falling in romantic and physical love with a man. That is as likely as the Virgin Mary turning tricks on a street corner. If some religious bigot wanted to disguise a piece of anti-Chinese propaganda as a clever adventure-fantasy they could not easily do better than The Lost Empire. It makes me wonder if the insult was intended. 
 As sweeping generalities go, this book ranks high in its attempt to use ambiguities as a replacement for specifics. In essence the book argues for the pre-eminence and necessity of being "hard" in order for America to be great. Michael Barone, former editor of U.S. News and World Report bounces around from topic to topic, settling on various issues long enough to throw out simple analyses that justifies the importance of being hard in the face of being "soft." The reader may interject the terms "conservative" for "hard" and "liberal" for "soft." I disagree with his generalities: the issue is two-fold when determining the best policy. The first issue is to find balance between the opposition. Few ideologies taken to an extreme are valuable. The Confucian ideal of finding the value in the middle of two ideas at odds with one another is valuable in an increasingly polarized world. The second issue is to actually go out on a limb and suggest that a specific ideological approach has value in certain situations; as these fluid situations change so must our ideologies. Nothing that exists in stasis, even religion, will survive without adaptation and change 
 Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love travel/adventure books, especially books at sea.  So I was really looking forward to this book.  I have never read a book more disappointing.  The writing is almost impossible to follow.  The setting (North Sea during Winter with tremendous storms) should have been spellbounding.  Instead most of the book involves long discourses between crewmembers as if no one is listening to the other person.  I believe only once does the author go above board and then only for a brief spell during a storm.  This book is not worth reading. 
 	In Heresy, Magic, and Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe, Gary K. Waite attempts to tie together the various persecutions that took place in Early Modern Europe.  Whether persecution was aimed against Christian heretics, witches, or Jews, its purpose was always the same: reinforcing current orthodoxy against growing doubt.  Thus, Waite claims that the more pluralistic the society, the less fringe groups were persecuted. 	This book is flawed.  Waite argues his thesis tendentiously, citing portions of scholarship on Early Modern Europe that support his claims and ignoring scholarship that would question them.  The book is a brief synthesis of other scholars' works, and Waite's contribution consists of mere assertions that lack supporting evidence.  Waite does not engage the sources of Early Modern Europe; instead he trusts others to do the work of research for him.  When he quotes a primary source, his citation is always from some secondary literature.  This form of "researching" may be fine for a survey of the historiography, but Waite is attempting to argue a thesis. 	Not only is his methodology wanting, but also his thesis is much too simplistic.  Waite argues as societies become more pluralistic, persecution of the "Other" lessens.  He cites example after example of how the reigning orthodoxy persecuted the "Other" in order to strengthen its position in society.  Places like the Netherlands and Maria Theresa's Austria, however, did not persecute irrationally because of tolerance for a multiplicity of ideas.  This formulation is inadequate.  Waite fails to grapple with the religious situation in Spain in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  Spain was the most ethnically and religiously diverse region in Europe, and its variegated population managed a high level of cooperation for centuries.  Instead of peaceful toleration, however, this region led to some of the most intense persecution of the "Other." 	Waite's explanation of the Jewish situation in Early Modern Europe also has many problems.  He asserts, "Jews ... were officially tolerated in the Christian west because they proved an extremely useful, if unwitting, ally in the campaign to expel religious doubt from the hearts of Christian believers" (19).  As a causal claim, this statement is ludicrous.  Waite implies a conspiracy by the Church to use Jews to quench Christian doubt.  The evidence does not support this assertion.  (His reasons for the persecution of women during the witch-hunts similarly lack evidentiary substantiation.) 	Not only are Waite's methods and assertions suspect, but he lacks a fundamental understanding of the subject that he is trying to address.  In the book's introduction, Waite writes, "Religion is always nonrational, for its tenets cannot be proven by empirical testing" (3).  This statement belies a misunderstanding of rationalism, religion, or both.  As a system of knowledge, rationalism is not dependent on evidence or empirical testing.  Rationalism relies on human reason.  Just as religion cannot be empirically tested, neither can mathematics.  Rationalism and empiricism are competing systems of knowledge.  Waite's conflation of the two demonstrates a positivist bent, and positivism is self-referentially absurd.  Thus, Waite founds his philosophical approach to this subject upon a defective meta-narrative, and readers should be skeptical of his claims 
 As a Spanish teacher and native speaker I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst student. I had the "pleasure" to teach this book for 3 years (formerly named "Bienvenidos", "A bordo" and "Buen Viaje")and I didn't like it the least. The publishers came up with a new format this year but although it looks more attractive you can still find many of the SAME old activities and many of the old pictures. The vocabulary section at the end of each chapter don't have the English translation what makes it quite difficult for the student when reviewing vocabulary. They have improved the culture sections,though; but still it is not good enough. If you learn Spanish using this book, please THANK your teacher, he/she has a lot of work to do when using this book. Buena suerte!  
 Like many people, I was drawn to Light in the Piazza by its amazing reviews.  It was only after I had purchased tickets that I saw the performance on the Tonys.  It didn't bode well.  As a whole the c.d, much like the production, is over-dramatic, overly sensational.  The music has been called "lush," however I think it leans more to "trying too hard."  It is all far too overdone.  The music also lacks any sort of conflict or passion.  All in all, a great disappointment 
 I bought this player because I wanted to play dvds from various regions.  The good news is that it plays discs from all regions outside of region 1 just as well as it plays those in region 1.  The bad news is that I never found a disc which the unit could play through in its entirety.  It would click, grind and sputter along for 30 or, on a good day, 50 minutes before just freezing up.  Save your money or buy a coby dvd-224, which is an infinitely superior unit 
 I was really looking forward to this book, because I believe each World Series, especially in the deadball era should be recorded for history with a scholarly account.  Unfortunately the 1906 White Sox- Cubs series still awaits that account.  Potential readers expecting a book of the same standard as Louis P. Masur's Autumn Glory or Roger I. Abrams The First World Series, both about the 1903 World Series will be sorely disappointed by this effort.  I got the impression that parts of the book were rushed out after the White Sox won the 2005 series and were not written by Bernard Weisberger, but by a TV script writer. I find it hard to believe that a "distinguished teacher and author of American History" and "one of the best historians on earth" could write in the following style.  "It was a great double play of the balletlike kind that makes baseball glow, and like Evers great pickup in the first, it stopped the hemorrhaging. But four more runs were in for Jones's pyrotechnic experts."  "He attended Georgetown University, and in 1902 earned his dental degree (the course for which was then shorter)."   Four years, two years, ten years, we are not told. One minute we are being given lengthy essays on Spalding, Comiskey and the labor wars, and then we are given very clipped one sentence career information about the actual players, who participated in the series.   Also some of the content and comment was just annoyingly wrong and clearly not checked by a competent editor.  For instance, "....-but the Irish and the Germans had begun to make their inroads."  This is 1906 we are discussing, and perhaps the author had never heard of Jennings, Keeler, Kelley and McGraw, those "hardscrabble Irish" heroes of the Baltimore Orioles. But surely as the players in the series included, Hofman, Sheckard, Moran, Schulte, Steinfeldt, Kling, Reulbach, Pfeister, Hahn, Rohe, Donahue, Dougherty, Sullivan, Altrock and Walsh, I think we can safely say that the Germans and Irish had more than "begun to make their inroads".  I don't like being so harsh, but when a book is only 184 pages long I want it to spend the pages on the subject or closely related themes, not lengthy diversions on baseball's labor wars, and the 2005 White Sox victory.  One particularly annoying feature was that in the first paragraph of chapter 5 Bernard Weisberger lenghtily explains that the third and fourth games of a best of seven series tied at one all are the "swing games", as if we are unable to count to three or four. Fielders are "like a hawk hovering over a field mouse", or run down fly balls "like a cheetah." If these embellishments were intended to replicate the style of 1906 newspaper reporting they were a singular failure.   This could have been such a good book if it had concentrated more on the series, the players, the season, and the city of Chicago as it was in 1906. If you are billed as "one of the best historians on earth" with "enormous talents" your books have to meet a very high standard, and unfortunately I don't think this book reached those standards 
 i love anna quindlen, i love literature, i love landscapes of the imagination, and i love london, so i was ready to love this book.  however, it didn't give me nearly the depth i wanted.  the essays are oddly generic, the comments oddly superficial.  i was left with little impression, literary or geographical.  i'm sad 
 The jacket and synopsis of this book read like it may have similar content to The Millionaire Next Door. The content is primarily fundamental personal financial planning information. The continual commercials for U.S. Trust and a cameo Schwab reference were a bit distracting 
 The book that arrived was the correct selection but arrived somewhat damaged with a wrinkled/ folded book cover.  If the packing was stronger, then the book would not have been damaged. 
 I wish I had read some of the reviews of this book before making my purchase. I would have passed on it. I was hoping for something a little more detailed, more definitive. Instead I see a smattering of questionable entries on locations that were easily accessed on his itinerary, whether they were the best the state has to offer or not. As many would, I first looked at a state I know well (Kansas), to see Wood's recommendations. Gulp - he was way off! If P.J. Dinsmoore's "Garden of Eden" in Lucas is not even mentioned, or the world's largest ball of twine in Cawker City, this guy has not done his homework. 
 Raven the trickser wants to give people the gift of light. Raven gives light but you have to read the book to find out what else happens.   
 Choose your attitude, Play, Make their day and be present.  There I saved you the 2 hours it takes to read this book 
 Should it be that easy to write a book? Collect all the bits and pieces from newspapers' weekend-supplements and almost scientific coffeetable-talk and toss in some currently fashionable phrases concerning physics and mathematics, stir until the lumps have disappeared and do not bother with the spices of explanation and insight. If you love math and physics, stay off  
 I was very disappointed to find that most of chapter 5 "Genetic Engineering" was incomplete. The chapter was cut off (on page 80) and was followed by a repetition of page 49-80. Chapter 6 "Why we should Worry" had been left out and the beginning of chapter 7 "Human Rights" (page 105-113) was missing as well. It was very important for me to work on precisely these (missing) chapters at exactly this moment in time, so I am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product.  
 I have read Bob Frissell's other books and they were both way better than this book. It is the information from the other summarized and written very poorly. The only new information was about "indigo children" and finding codes in certain holy writings which was thoroughly uninteresting. Don't waste your money on this rehashed book. The cover is the best thing about it. Buy Nothing In This Book Is True and Something ITBIT 
 CD album not what I thought it was....Of course PB plays a mouth harp.....of course, the songs sometimes all sound alike...that is why he's not a ZZ, BB or whatever. One maybe two songs on these 2 cd's I like.....the rest go in file 13. There's nothing wrong with this style of music but it falls far short of Buddy Guy, BB King, Albert King....I am/was relunctant to negative any musician and this is not the case....Many of his good songs are missing and "fillers" placed instead. Unless you are a whipping Paul Butterfield fan, keep looking..... 
 I had a Kodak camera for years that I absolutely loved.  We took it ice skating and ended up falling on it.  Therefore, my family bought me this Sony for my b-day and I have to say this is the worst camera I have ever owned.  If you have any movement (such as action shots or small children) the picture always comes out blurry.  What a pain!  Also, the picture quality is horrible.  I will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a Kodak 
 Ken Russell is a gifted director, as his erratic career has proved, but even the great Vanessa Redgrave can't save this one. "The Devils," a gaudy, loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism, went painfully awry. Grisly images of plague victims, quack cures, peculiar enemas, and Oliver Reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail--unfortunately, they are merely stomach-turning. A stocky, wild-eyed Oliver Reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as Father Grandier, the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century French town, and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake. Gemma Jones is one bright spot as Grandier's innocent love interest, and Ms. Redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of Sister Jeanne, but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart 
 I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was "Little Red Corvette" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is "Let's Pretend We're Married". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was "Delirious". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here 
 I stumbled upon Jack Stewart, have read several of his books and thoroughly enjoyed them.  As I'm reading Hurricane, I keep getting the feeling I've read it before, knowing that I haven't.  After a little research, yes I have read it before it was named Diamond Sky - the names have changed (a little) and instead of cocaine it was diamonds, but the plot is exactly the same.  Come on Mr. Stewart. . .you can do better than that 
 This book is a total bore. The flowery description is beautiful for the first three sentences, but then it becomes a tranparent cover-up for a book with no plot! Even I could write a more interesting book, and I failed high school english! Muir was a great person, but he sould have stayed where he was better aquianted: the woods! Anyone who enjoys this book obviously has never seen a tree before. A whole book dedicated to them is ironic and lame 
 The book was disappointing. I returned it. I was looking for something with much more detail. The book seemed to be written at a middle school or early high school level 
 Supposedly a novel, this very dated tome is neither fish nor fowl.  It can't seem to decide what it wants to be.  A story or a lecture?  Serious historical fiction, or a platform for a broad satirical attack on the Catholic Church?  If the latter, then be warned:  most readers won't find it very funny.  Humor ages fast.  What's amusing in one era is a great big yawn in another.    There's no plot in any modern sense of the word.  Joan wanders, picaresque fashion, from one implausible adventure to another, with tedious predictability.  Every ten pages or so I had to fight the temptation to put it down, for the story keeps lagging, occasionally coming to a dead halt to allow the author to launch yet another boring and repetitive diatribe against the Church.    There's no character development or subtlety.   Joan is a difficult character to like, for she seems to have little motivation except an undiscriminating sexuality, which exists primarily as a device to launch her into strained and silly encounters with prelates.    The prose is excruciatingly awkward, probably because        1. it was written 150 years ago, and   2. it's been translated from the Greek.  For proof of this, just read the passage quoted by one of the Spotlight reviewers above (who cites it to prove that the writing is wonderful!):   "Such a miracle was unheard of; and indeed would have been a singular contribution to the annals of Christian thaumaturgy which, while it borrowed many a prodigy from the pagans, had not yet reached the point where..."  etc. etc.      Shakespeare, this isn't.  Nor is it Joyce Carol Oates or Sue Monk or Frank McCourt or any other modern writer with a feel for the beauty and the power of the English language.   If you're looking for a non-fiction book about Pope Joan that discusses the historical evidence for her existence, then get the books by Peter Stanford (pro-Joan) or Alain Bourreau (anti-Joan).   If you're looking for an exciting and well-written read based on the actual historical record,  then get the novel by Donna Woolfolk Cross. Avoid this ROYIDIS/DURRELL book at all costs,  for it's neither one nor the other.     
 Save your money.  Anyone with even the least bit of intelligence can come up with more interesting ideas on helping children learn social studies.   
 I can't remember if Doctor Wallach is mentioned in his book or not but the other day I came across this man's site, promoting his book. He had a listing there about Doctor Joel Wallach. Within the first sentence he said that Wallach claims that all diseases are a result of mineral deficiency! Amazing...this is how he calls Wallach a quack? With a complete and total LIE. That's right. See I have Wallach's books. My family takes his supplements. I am part of Wallach's company email: Ekowal459@aol.com to discuss it further if you're inclined, etc. Now, I have also listened to DOCTOR Wallach's seminars in about 20 different variations and have health successes of my own as a result of him. Never once does Dr. Wallach [BS,DVM+ND] or his Wife Dr. Ma Lan [A Microsurgeon MD with a Masters in Science and liscensed Acupuncturist], ever come within the neighborhood of saying that all diseases are caused by mineral deficiency! This is insane and completely untrue. Furthermore he discredits Wallach for calling himself a physician by the implication that a Naturopathic doctor is NOT a physician on the grounds that he is NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR. Once again a moron who can't understand how someone who's primary means of health care for patients is not pharmaceuticals can be a legitimate Doctor. So by his standards Osteopaths are not Physicians? No one can heal anyone else unless they dispence pharmaceuticals? Oh that's right, Naturopaths can dispense pharmaceuticals in state's which allow it...like the one Wallach trained and worked in...interesting. And Wallach does recommend some pharmaceuticals where prudent...he's not a lunatic. He talks about what an outrage his claims are? Such an outrage... I have one of his seminars on tape where he is speaking to 200 DOCTORS. Why would they even show up? This man tries to discredit Doctor Wallach and that which he says which aren't lies are just foolish arguments that make him look like the con artist or just plain ignorant of his subject [Wallach, Naturopathy, Health...etc. Don't waste your time on this man's books. I won't even talk about the positive points in this book that actually have merit because as far as I'm concerned his ranting about Doc Wallach on his site... and in the book, I seem to recall, discredits everything else period.

 The only reason why I saw this was because of Susannah York. This shows she was more capable of the dix she played in "The Killing of Sister George" and was a fine actress. Otherwise this movie is blah. It's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting. The men in this movie are so disgusting one can't blame her for getting mad anyway. For another pointless film of this caliber see Secret Ceremony 
 This book disgusted me. I have never read anything so incestuous. 'Tale of Genji' is an overindulgent, horrific story. Any man who covets a girl of approxiamately age seven for a wife is what I would call a 'pedophile' not a prince. Not to mention that he impregnates his step mother. I have to wonder about those who gave this book 5 stars. Spare yourself the disgust, and use your money more wisely 
 I borrowed this book a while ago, hoping for an enjoyable light read. Unfortunately not.   The main character of this series, Amelia Peabody, is supposedly interesting. Unfortunately not. Obsessed that men are the evil of every age, her rants occupy almost every page. Her "supposed insights" and commentary were so long that I found myself speed-reading through the pages, scanning as many as 20 pages every few minutes.   The sidekick is just as annoying. While she isn't complaining about the weather, she is busy fainting.   Anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the "Mummy" was. What little intrigue there was, was ruined by the predictability.   Although the writing was quite enjoyable, it was ruined by many of the characters. I'd take one of the case studies of Sherlock Holmes over this any day. Or any book by PD James or JD Robb. 
 I got this DVD as part of a set of Hallmark mini-series and hoped it would be as good as some of the others. The other mini-series were fantasy-based so unrealistic dialog worked just fine in them but this one was full of overly theatrical and unrealistic assertions which not only ruined the story by robbing it of any depth but also made it very difficult for the actors to perform well. After all, it's hard to credibly deliver one sweeping statement after another with little in between to connect those statements or build relationships to the point where they make sense.  I think the writers (perhaps properly) assumed viewers were familiar with the basic characters so they just skipped character development and went straight to having the characters speak in a macro fashion. This was a mistake and the entire miniseries suffers for it.  Timothy Dalton seems to give it his all despite poor material and Billy Zane either by virtue of his character or adequate acting chops does alright. Leonor Varela, unfortunately, is simply not up to the task of playing Cleopatra as she deserves to be portrayed. While waiting for Caesar, she seems to be waiting anxiously for her prom date to show up. In her scenes with Dalton, she seems to be acting in love rather than coming across as actually in love with him. She does look great though and can wear the revealing costumes well.  I wouldn't have bought this DVD on its own and I'm uncertain if I'll watch it again. I like mini-series in general and many of the Hallmark productions specifically but I'm afraid I can't recommend this one 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 The author Thomas Carlyle presents the history of the French Revolution as a prophetic poetry of his intellect, and rightfully burned on his presentation for review.  As reading this book realize the great store of words and meanings that suited his direction rather than the true nature of the French Revolution of the peoples.  What an awful book 
 Coghead (Brooklyn, NY): I understand how you feel, but we must understand that every artist must one: create his/her own style and two: they have to keep up with what is in style. Reggaeton is a new genre and in order to be competitive and have longivity in this business you can still stick to your style but you have to keep pace with what's in. I love La India and yes the cd could be better but her cd is up to date with what is being listened to. Maybe for her next album, Pure Salsa will be back in style. La India will always be the next female Celia 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 Some journalists write excellent history.  Others produce mediocre but acceptable historical books.  But some are simply awful, like Thomas Laird, who tried hard to write something profound but failed.  Having seen the substantive criticism from experts, one could hardly believe the bad reviews were true, but they didn't reveal just how badly this is done.  Besides the multitude of factual errors, it's stylistically annoying--as if Laird were trying to write a screenplay for Oliver Stone, another propagandist with an agenda who cares little for facts if they get in the way of the story he wants to tell.  
 This book is guaranteed to make you fall asleep. Some people take a glass of warm milk, others taking sleeping tablets; But this book has absolutely no side effects and is can make *anybody* fall asleep within 10 minutes! Try it for yourself.. 
 Aside from the song, "Brother", this CD is not worth your money. I'm not attacking these guys on a personal level, but anyone that appreciates music will see this CD has no flow. It sounds as if a few guys got together and created some decent riffs and then hastily hired a singer to apply lyrics so they could pump the thing out. The result is just as I said; a few good bass and guitar riffs and lyrics with religious overtones and no feel to the whole thing. There is nothing clever or conceptual about their music. Nothing lasting or memorable. Nothing worth your hard earned $. If this band has as much talent as the reviews that I read here all seem to say, where is the 2nd release? There won't be one 
 This is perhaps one of the worst albums ever produced. While there are undeniably moments of pop catchiness, they fade within seconds. Furthermore, if you are masochist enough to subject yourself to any footage of the act, you will find a revolting arrogance that is so dreadfully misplaced that it will turn your stomach. The next time that you find yourself ever-so-briefly caught in that forgetful moment you will want to immediately destroy the device from which their putrid music emanates 
 I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending. 
 The first year or so, the characters made me think being 13 would really be this simple and fun. Reality set in pretty fast, however. Ann Martin lightly tiptoes around subjects like disabilites, absentee parents, and divorce. As a child of divorce from the age of five on, I found the butter-smooth TV-sitcom resolutions of (I think) two characters' parental break-ups downright insulting, even at my young age at the time.   Ms. Martin, you are doing girls no favors with this one-dimensional cotton-candy fantasy teenage world, written only for cold hard cash. How many are there now, 500+? Speaking of which,  my mother bought a second copy of the first 1986 printing of BSC #1 and still has it sealed in plastic like a mint-condition comic book. Maybe in 40 or so years, or after Ms. Martin kicks the bucket, whatever comes first, it'll be worth a little $$ for us. Just food for thought. 
 I wouldn't buy it again. I like to try to new things and I had never had this before,but it wasn't that good. Yes, my crew ate it, they eat almost anything this isn't moving 
 The trouble with all-star tribute albums to past superstar artists and bands is that oftentimes they are done purely for money, attention, and a sense that certain of those artists can one-up the artists being paid the "tribute" to; and often, the results don't come close to measuring up to the originals.  Such, I'm afraid, is the case with the 1993 COMMON THREADS album, where Nashville artists give their props to that renegade bunch of desperados who occupied the Hotel California for most of the 1970s, the Eagles.  The brainchild of Eagles manager Irving Azoff, who saw how revered the band had become amongst the Nashville hierarchy of the Nineties, COMMON THREADS also functioned as a charity album, whose profits went to the Walden Woods Project, of which Eagles drummer Don Henley was a particularly prominent supporter.  Were it not for that one particular aspect, COMMON THREADS would be as much an aberration as a lot of other tribute albums of its type.  Even as this album already stands, however, and even though it caused hell to freeze over and the Eagles to reunite, the artists here still fall well short of what the band originally did.  What seems to have happened here is that each of the artists got so caught up in the idea of doing songs from the Eagles' massively successful catalog that they thought they could get off by copying almost note-for-note and by arrangement what the band had done; one listen to Travis Tritt's version of "Take It Easy", and Vince Gill's take on "I Can't Tell You Why" seems to indicate this.  In other cases, they sound terribly anemic, as in Clint Black's version of "Desperado", where he sounds like second-rate John Denver (and I think John Denver could have done this far better than Clint Black).  And hearing faux-Eagles wanna-bes like Little Texas doing "Peaceful Easy Feeling" and Diamond Rio doing "Lyin' Eyes" is no substitute whatsoever for the real thing.  The womenfolk don't have it much easier either.  Lorrie Morgan simply sounds out of place on "The Sad Cafe", seemingly not having any idea about the song's mournful inspiration; and Tanya Tucker's toughness on "Already Gone" is quite dull.  Suzy Bogguss' take on "Take It To The Limit" is a bit better, but it won't make anyone forget the Randy Meisner-led original. And Trisha Yearwood's version of "New Kid In Town" is okay, but she sounds like she's trying to do it the way she thinks her idol Linda Ronstadt would, and it's not totally successful either.  In the end, the inability of contemporary Nashville artists to really understand the Eagles lies in the fact that there is a very wide gap between the Eagles' sound of the 1970s and the way contemporary Music Row does things.  Though classified as "country-rock", the Eagles also mixed in elements of bluegrass, surf-rock, R&B, disco, and even Tex-Mex a time or two, styles that are largely alien to contemporary Nashville.  As Linda herself, around whom the Eagles originally formed in 1971, has said, it is a part of the diverse spectrum of California music: "California music is a real hybrid, very specialized, and it doesn't have anything to do with Nashville."  This is something that I'm not sure these artists really understand, and why I can't give this album a better rating 
 This is surely one of the nastiest little films ever made.  It is a waste of a handsome young actor, John Shepherd, who plays a very troubled and closeted construction worker, David.  He is secretly in love with his best friend, Theo, and his covert problems multiply when Theo moves in with a girlfriend.  David can't handle the competition for Theo's affection, and goes overboard in trying to undermine their relationship.  He decides to come out to his parents, and tell Theo of his love, on a national TV-show!  This unfortunate plan, needless to say, backfires.  David's ghastly father pronounces him sick and summarily kicks him out of the house.  His now ex-friend Theo is angry at being manipulated, and shows David just how much so by beating him with a lead pipe!  It turns out that he and his girlfriend were a perfect match afterall:  they are equally unpleasant.  They walk off into the sunset together, but not before they look back at poor, bleeding David with a mixture of pity and loathing.  The perfect ending for a mean-spirited film that TLA should be ashamed to have produced 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 I continue to marvel at "men" like James Dobson who blatantly ignores all the solid statistical evidence that children brought up with love and without violence function better in life.  Dobson is also an anti-porn crusader, and he also ignores the fact that anywhere porn has been legalized, rape statistics have dropped dramatically. (Source: the book 'Porn 101' 
 I purchased this book based on the highly positive reviews I read here. I intended to donate it to our high school's library in honor of the teacher who offers the women's lierature course.  Sadly, the first page precluded me from making the donation. I did not find much to applaud in the latter pages either.  Disappointed 
 I had another Norelco shaver for the last 5 (or more) years.  The difference in the shaves is striking.  Both less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer.  However, the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery inside it instead of 2.  I know this because I took it in to be "repaired" because I only got 8 shaves to a charge.  I talked (online) with Norelco and they said my shaver was broken.  So, I looked up on the Norelco site a local authorized repair shop.  I took it in and the guy opened it up.  He said it was one of the "cheap" versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries.  My old shaver, over most of its life, gave me 25 or so shaves before needing to be recharged.  That's quite a difference 
 I had the same experience with this as I did with one of Rettenmund's other books (Blind Items).  Several friends recommended it, it seemed like a good and fun topic, and yet I could not make it past chapter 4.  Rettenmund's writing style reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper: The articles go on for pages and pages to say something that could be said in two paragraphs.  If you like this writing style, Rettenmund's books may be for you.  Personally it drove me crazy 
 ¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best! 
 While I think Ms. Burke has real talent, this book left me cold.  Despite all the other very positive reviews, I found the ongoing "back-stories" confusing and hard to follow.  Our "heroine", Irene Kelly, doesn't even appear until page 149!  And there are just too many characters, and too many family relationships to keep straight.  Not to mention too many references to other plot-lines not being explained in this book.  Perhaps this book should have been separated into two, or even three, stand-alone books.  I think "Bloodlines" would  have benefited enormously from more capable editing 
 40 or so minutes per disk of footage mainly taken from German TV. Experimental camera techniques have not dated well. Content is widely available elsewhere at much better value for your money, compilation probably put together by an accountant 
 I found this book to be very ponderous reading with the descriptions going on and on.  Characters did not become very real.  The actions of Charles do not seem believable.  I read this book because it was one that my book club had read before I joined.  While I did not enjoy the book I think I would have been very interested in the book club's discussion of this book 
 I bought this book because I had read and enjoyed some of Phillipa Gregory's historical novels. This one did not fill the bill for me. As a supposedly independent-thinking woman of spirit, I found Julia to be incredibly naive. Love is not an emotion that any female could possibly feel after being raped - especially after suffering abuse since childhood at the hands of her brother / playmate / husband.   I found her  characters to be either psychotic or dazed by all that laudunam (sp) they took. After reading THE FAVORED CHILD, I have no desire to read the first or the third in this trilogy. 
 Comedy comes in many forms--everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire--and in "Just Friends" there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types.  First, the movie wants to be a gross-out comedy.  The sight gags are plentiful, the physical comedy abundant and often cruel, and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic.  However, the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy--the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart.  These elements have been combined successfully in the past--"There's Something About Mary" jumps right to mind.  Here, we get something far less successful.  First, the good news.  There are legitimate laughs to be had in "Just Friends" and that was a pleasant surprise.  If you don't care about character development and just want inane humor, you could do worse than this movie.  And if the sight of Ryan Reynolds in a fat suit sounds like the height of hilarity to you--check this out right away.  Sadly, it's the romantic comedy angle that fails to ignite.  There is nothing real at stake here to care about--and the blame for this falls squarely on Reynolds' character (I'll use the word character lightly here).  Reynolds may be one of our greatest sitcom actors working--the problem, however, is that he's not in sitcoms anymore.  He's making movies, unfortunately--and his hamming up to the camera always seem to take the place of a real character.  Here, he plays a celebrity insider--a successful, trendy record executive.  And yet, he's not believable as trendy, successful or professional.  His character vacillates between being the a villain and a hero, you never know or understand him--he just does whatever is necessary to set up the next gag.  It's too bad, really, because Amy Smart--as his love interest--IS playing a character.  I'm not usually a fan, but here she does nicely and the movie lets her down.  But it's Anna Faris that I'm going to single out for the most inspired performance.  The funniest bits to me revolve around her character--a shallow, insane pop star.  Sure, it's an easy target--but she throws herself into the role with such hilarious, over-the-top gusto that she is easily a cast standout.  Again, some humor--no emotion.  If you don't expect much from your comedy, you might just like this.  The fatal flaw for me is that I felt this film wanted me to care about the central relationship, but didn't do anything to make it REAL. 
 I used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since I'm engorged and found out the motor is broken.  I'm very disappointed since I trusted the Medela name.  If I could afford it, I'd replace it with the Pump-in-Style, but unfortunately, I'll have to try a manual pump 
 Boy, and I thought "Cats" was bad. This is the single most boring, stupid, pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears. There is no story line, no range in music, no feeling, no lyrics to back up the awful music. I mean, the list could go on forever. I warn you, it's the biggest waste of $25.00 that you might, no, will ever spend. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and trust me. DON"T BUY THE CD!!! And if you do, when you put it on, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.You've been warned. Now please, spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life 
 I must be getting old since I've never done this sort of thing before, but I was so frustrated after about 70 pages of this book that I brought it back to the store. Expecting a solid historical novel set in the declining days of Roman Britain, I found that it started off smartly enough . . . lots of action tautly presented (apparently essential in today's market if you want to see your stuff published). But the tale just didn't catch fire. Told from the protagtonist Publius Varrus' point of view, the story sputters along as our hero leads an expedition into the British hinterlands to trade for iron (becoming ever scarcer as the Roman occupation winds down), stops to slaughter some invading Celts and burn their ship, rushes back to sit by the fire with his superior Caius Britannicus (of solid, old Roman stock and an old friend) to decry the aging process, etc., then dallying gratuitously with the lascivious wife of another friend (who finally kills her in a rage, along with everyone else in his household and himself), and listening to his own fine upstanding mate bemoan the moral deterioration in their little Roman colony as a harbinger of terrible things to come! All in the first 70 pages or so -- I couldn't take much more of it and shut the book, rushing it back to the store to reclaim my cash. Haven't given up on historical novels but this one clearly didn't work for me. Perhaps I am just growing less patient as my own aging process sets in. Still many others here liked the book so perhaps I just didn't stay with it long enough to give it a fair chance. The truth is my eyes aren't what they used to be so I don't want to waste them reading things which don't take off in some fashion for me. And this one just didn't. -- SW 
 Blowback follows very well trodden ground. A standard cop vs. serial killer movie, it sticks to the cliches of the genre.  The killer's "twist" is that he kills each victim in the style of a martyred saint, with a bible reference in a test tube placed in the mouth. Perhaps the intention is to echo other recent screen psychos like Seven's John Doe or Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill. Blowback's villain is, however, like all the other characters, lacking in character depth and ultimately unconvincing.   Mark L. Lester, the director, has been a prolific producer of mediocre action movies, notably Commando and Big Trouble in Little China. Some of these can perhaps survive as late night movies to be watched over a few beers. Still, even among the lesser cop movies, there are a lot that should be seen before this one. Try Fallen or Bone Collector. Regarding the DVD, it's 3:4 format, with no features (not that you'd want them 
   I went through a big Hawkwind phase in the early 90s and remember the excitement and joy when this CD arrived at the local mall from being specially ordered (This was before the internet was big, and odd, weird, unpopular stuff had to be special ordered by phone or catalog)    On first listen, I was let down.  'You Shouldn't Do That' can be described as one of most atrocious instrumentals known to man.  It does start off cool enough with an eerie, trippy special effect intro simulating something taking off into space.  Then as soon as the saxophone kicks in, everything turns to crap!  It's one thing to know how to play the sax and quite another to just mindlessly blow into the stupid thing.  Anyways, when all the key instruments get introduced in the beginning and kind of work their way up into the main riff, it then sounds like the sax and guitar start vomiting on eachother, and then it repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats until they vomit on eachother again; then repeats a few more dozen times for a total of 15 painful minutes!!  At one point, everyone in the group seemed content to plunk out any old note which made the song barely listenable at all.  By then, the only musician holding this fiasco together was the drummer.  And the lyrics?  Why would you put non-sensical hippeeisms into a so called 'space rock' song?  I dont know.  Out of the 30 or 40 times I heard this song, I only sat through the WHOLE thing twice!!  Apologies to die-hard fans for slamming this track, but it really IS that bad and puts a big dent in the album considering its length.      Now that that atrocity is out of the way, on to the rest of the album- the other songs aren't really that bad and make for some interesting soundscape music.  'You're Only Dreaming' has a wonderful 'breath of fresh air' motif as a backing to it's graceful swirl of electrics.  'Master of the Universe' was the sinister heavy metal track about the all supreme being- the guitar chords to this are nice fat and distorted.  I do prefer this version to the 'Space Ritual' version because even though the Ritual's version is faster and heavier,  it repeats itself beyond all levels of tolerance.  'In Search of Space's' version seems slower but shorter and to the point at the same time.    'Adjust Me' is another exploration of atmosphere and fuzzed out electronics.  It conjures up images of an android assembly plant and one of them seems to malfunction beyond control: 'adjust me... adjust meee adjust meeeee  adjust meeeeeeeeeeee'.  Very cool.       'We took the Wrong Step Years Ago' and 'Children of the Sun' are very extremely well played acoustic works that draw beautiful, lush, vivid images.  I would say that mr. Brock fares better with the acoustic guitar than the electric.  He has very good rythm.      All in all, a decent early 70s space rock album save for the first 15 minute bowel movement.  It renders this album rather short but thankfully, the re-issue has bonus tracks to make up for this.  
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 To believe this inane tripe by P. Jeffery, you have to assume three things:  1.) Smith **somehow** managed to perfectly imitate Clement's style and fool all the experts on Clement. 2.) Smith also **somehow** managed to perfectly imitate Mark's style perfectly AND actually fill in the lacunae in the Gospel text. 3.) Smith **somehow** managed to expertly forge the text itself.  Are we to assume that a biblical scholar of Smith's stature would attempt to ruin his career by creating a hoax? And then make cryptic references within the text to INCREASE his chances of being caught?!? Absurdity.  Bottom Line: Mr. Jeffery, please go and carbon-date the ink/parchment of Secret Mark and stop embarrassing yourself 
 After reading mostly rave reviews on this fryer, I ordered it with great anticipation.  I should have heeded the other reviews and purchased a different fryer.  Taking the advice of several reviewers, I tried keeping the temperature at 350 degrees instead of 375 while frying battered fish in one basket and french fries in the other one.  The fish stuck to it's basket and the fries were brown and soggy.  So, I tried the same scenario with the temp at 375.  The fish still stuck to the basket; the fries were still brown and soggy.  Even tried the "twice-fried" method for the fries with no significant improvement in the crispness factor.  I was also disappointed with the long cooking time as another reviewer noted.  After a VERY LONG, tiring and trying cooking experience, I scrambled for my old faithful large pot, piled in Crisco and lovingly dropped in the rest of the fish.  Ta-Da!! PERFECTION!  Needless to say, I am giving away this frying fiasco.  
 There are so many other awesome books out there to read. So, why would anyone read this series? The writing is sappy, the plot nonexistant, and the characters unlikable. But, the author really isn't that bad, I mean her Canadian Series is very good. But this series does not deserve a movie status. Now before everyone get's mad, realize that I have read the entire series when I was 11 or 12 and liked them immensely. But now that I am many years up from that I thought to read them again, and was disappointed. Great for someone that hasn't read much great literature. Pride and Prejudice anyone? but not so good for those of us who have. Please don't spend your money on this series unless you've read one first. They are not all they are cracked up to be. 
 + sturdy construction + intro to many topics + problems at end of chapter have page reference of the answer   - shallow coverage of too many topics - some key learning points are left to the student in an intro book - poor formatting and organization  = an intro book that doesn't build enough on the foundations and tries to cover too much in this growing fiel 
 You shipped it to the wrong address and I never received it!!! 
     The title enticed me and I had high expectations to glean some insight into modern economic problems - or at least hear some different perspectives. The book is not a bad read, but it suffers from two continual errors that, as a scholar, I find really annoying. First, in many of the graphs presented, they are not numbered, cited in the text, associated with legends NOR are the axes labelled. The trends are obvious, of course, but I had no idea what the heck I was looking at. There is also a lot of jargon thrown at the reader without explanation.      Second, there are no references for many of the statements made in the book. It would be nice to know where they got their data or even IF they are making a claim based on real data (I assume they are, but without references, who knows?). You may like this book and, again, it's not a bad read, but I got so frustrated with the shoddy scholarship that I just set it down halfway through and gave up. I really don't care to listen to opinions as much as I enjoy examining positions and arguments... and those require some scholarship whereas anyone can throw out an opinion 
 On KB10, the Kidz Bop Bratz killed Madonna's "Hung Up". Because of this, they must die. I doubt they even know who Madonna is, much less the song where the sample comes from. I long for the day when Kidz Bop is derailed, crashes, rolls down a cliff, and then is decimated by an 18-wheeler. I'm not going into the songs on here, but I will say this: they suck really badly. Thank you, and have a pleasant day.  THIS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE FOUNDATION FOR BETTER MUSIC 
 Considering that this book is written by a technical writer for technical writers, it shows poor quality writing. Split infinitives, passive voice, and generally poor style abound.  The primary function of this book is to list common practices for technical writing, with a few limited style recommendations. For example, explain why the user should do something before you tell them what to do. "To see more detailed information, select Help."  The value of the book lies exclusively in enumerating common practices. For that reason, buy it. Then prepare to grind your teeth as you wade through horrible writing 
 Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back 
 This book is the type that sends people to sleep.  The information is presented in such a way that it feels excruciating to read it. I have taken several philosophy courses and am reading Baudrillard's "Simulacra and Simulation" right now so am not intimidated by complex texts. I have been interested in philosophy since high school. Although this book offers itself as a 'beginner book' it is not inviting and doesn't perform the essential task of a beginner book, to inspire further inquiry.Listed in the introduction of what this book has to offer : "1. Each text presents a clear, well-argued answer to a central philosophical question." Where is the prompt to act? The question and the answer are already worked out for anyone that cares to read through the less than exciting phrasing. If one has a good memory, the text could be memorized and one could claim to know something about philosophy 
 The Bancroft is the history profession's Pulitzer, so I was looking forward to being edified.  What I got instead was an impenetrable tome consisting mainly of fashionable deconstructionist babble about how war is defined among different cultures.  I read and read and never found a coherent narrative about what this war was supposed to be about or what it had to do with American identity.  Perhaps this "language of academe" impressed the Bancroft committee, itself made up of pedants, but to the common reader, whom the academy putatively serves, this thing is worthless.  I have the feeling that these guys began reading, and when their eyes started to glaze over they said, "My kind of history! 
 For years Discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science. Now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless. Very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science. After buying Discover since it's very inception I find it sad what has happened to this magazine. Check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months 
 If you are looking for an unabashed cheerleader on the American Way, this book is for you. If you are already convinced that America is the pinnacle of Western Civilization, nothing in this book will change your mind. If you voted for George W Bush - you'll probably enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you believe America has made some mistakes and are looking for arguments to convince you that what you thought were mistakes were actually smart decisions - look elsewhere.   Revel is a lover of capitalism, liberalism, obviously an admirer of the USA and probably of George W Bush as well. He makes his disdain for many European positions, as well as those of the American left, quite clear. This is a book written for people who agree with American foreign policy. Revel is well informed on many American foreign policy positions as well as European arguments against those positions. On the rare occasions when he is not insulting Europeans who disagree with him, he provides intelligent and thoughtful views on foreign affairs.   The author spends most of the book distorting European views and insulting those who hold them. A fine example is his description of the US Missile Defense system. He claims that there are 2 arguments against it. One, that it doesn't work and the second that it will work too well and make useless the arsenals of the other nuclear powers. These are obviously contradictory arguments and he claims to be baffled that anyone could believe them both. Oddly enough, I've never heard from anyone who believed them both. I do recall the letter signed by 50 Nobel prize winning scientists claiming that the project is a waste of money. I also recall hearing from those worried about angering Russia and China.   Mr Revel's penchant for ridiculing those who disagree with him is occasionally amusing but never convincing. It's a shame. I think he's right on a number of points. If he would just turn his copious knowledge of foreign policy and his broad vocabulary toward convincing people instead of insulting them - he might actually have an impact on someone who doesn't agree with him already. 
 Edward Said, created a proble and made a career of the Israel Palestine Conflict, and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the Arab Palestinians. He was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry, linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti Israel and anti Jewish hatred on every University he spoke at. Hopefully, this "vintage" book will become no longer relevant, ans disappear 
 Disappointed in this latest story by a superb storyteller.  The characters were unsympathetic and lacked substance.  The overly dramatic Catholic guilt/miracle was boring.  Hopefully in the future Ms. Frank will stick to characters and stories of the low country which she has an affinity for 
 I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my husband, and it did work well at first, but within one week we found that it was locking up and had to send it back.  I have since read that this is commonly occuring problem with this item.  Amazon handled the return fairly graciously.  My husband did his own research and purchased a Tom Tom which has been fantastic and has more options.   
 Mark Dery's writing style makes my mind wander and fails to pull me in. He mentions something about everything, from Ace Ventura's anal speech to the burning of Waco. "The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the  Brink" gives short insight into life's odd episodes, freak shows, and  moments of insanity but misses out on making a statement worthy of  reaction. As I read, I kept thinking, "yes, I know, so what?" Give me  something, anything. I guess was expecting more 
 I have read the first 12 books in the Left Behind series multiple times. They are fantastic! The first books I ever read that I could not put down.  The prequels were boring.  This book is entertaining in parts, and sometimes interesting. But in the end, it's a big wasted oppurtunity. Why give the final battle only one chapter in the book? 95% of the book takes place about 100 years into the millenium. Why? The most important and interesting stuff is the final victory. Why not spend time on the huge army building up, instead of skimming over it in a few paragraphs? Not to mention cramming the final judgements and victory into a couple pages. Why skim over all the most interesting parts, but spend endless pages on Biblical characters telling their stories? And endless detailed description of life during the millenium? I really can't figure out what the point of the book was. I thought it would tbe about the final victory, as the cover says. But so little of the book is actually about the final victory.  I don't want to consider this the last book in the Left Behind series. It's more like a postquel (haha). This is a hard review to write because I just love the series. As bad as this book was, it can't change the first 12 books, which are simply amazing reads 
 High hopes were set in place for this blu-ray release, and I have to admit I am sadly dissapointed.  The transfer is only a 'fraction' above watching a SD DVD version upscaled, which is a real shame.   Buy at your own risk, or wait for a much better release, hopefully Director's Cut, remastered and all.  2.5/5 for effort.  -zallap 
 I really did want to like this book. It held the promise of demystifying alchemy and applying it to my psychological growth. Unfortunately, I found it sorely lacking in practical applications, exercises, etc. It was also very disorganized, printed on extremely cheap paper and throws in cross-cultural references to Zen Buddhism. Excuse me, but I wanted a book on Western esotericism, not Eastern. .. 
 If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series.  This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over.  I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was "That's it?!" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels 
 I have read the previous reviews and I am puzzled. I do not like this book at all. I have never written a review before but this book drove me to it. I am an experienced baker and tried two recipes following the instructions carefully.  Both failed miserably and I am not willing to waste the butter, or more importantly, the chocolate, to try another. My first attempt was the Paisely Brownies.  The recipe called for 12 ounces of butter (yes, ounces, not tablespoons).  While nervous about 3/4 of a pound of butter going into essentially a double batch of brownie batter, I forged ahead.  What I got was incredible greasy brownies with a gummy raspberry topping.  I figured the butter amount must have been a typo so I tried again with 12 TABLESPOONS of butter and while the brownies were less greasy, they were still mushy in the middle with a gummy raspberry topping.  Next I tried the Topsy Turvys (didn't even get around to making the sorbet or the pineapple topping).  Each attempt to mold the baked cookie into bowl shapes yielded greasy messes on my counter.  Perhaps I got the two dogs out of the whole bunch but as I have said before, I'm not willing to waste any more butter, chocolate, parchment paper, etc. on any of his recipes 
 When you look at the title of this book--Planet of the Beast, you think maybe the author is referring to Jason? Nope rather a stupidly contrived planet nick-name for planet #666 how dumb is that? However being that this is a sci-fi Horror, I'm willing to just go with the flow and give the author Nancy Kilpatrick the benefit of the doubt. Planet of the Beast is a slow read, not totally intolerable like the last book, "the Experiment" by Pat Cadigan.  The first half of this book introduces 11 characters living at space station G7 including a meglomaniac doctor and his weasaly assistant which definatley had over tones of Dr Frankenstein and Igor all over it. Including their plan to "create" a new being by way of cloning. Total cheese.     After 200 pages of space regulations and botched interstellar protocol and characters pulling rank on each other our guy Jason finally shows up on board to wreak havoc.  Some of the scenes are pretty cool in typical Jason style, but again(which happens in a lot of these Jason X novels or the Friday the 13th novels) Jason takes a back seat to yet more character development and personal insight. I don't really need to know all that extraneous info on a character that gets disemboweled!     This book could have been any sci fi book, all you had to do was insert the word "alien" or "monster" into the spots that says "Jason X."  Technology on the space station is o.k. for a sci fi book that takes place in the 24th Century, some force fields, advanced nanotechnology, interesting space suits and laser weapons outfit the G7 space station/lab.  The Author almost gives you a walk through of the space station as the story progresses, almost like its a travelogue.      Oh yeah, whats this bunk with calling him "Jason X"? I thought he was just plain old Jason?  Jason "X" was just the number of the film, you know X=10.  The hokey camp fire stories being told by one of the characters pits jason against soldiers in louisiana swamp, and another has Jason back in the 1930's going after Dorothy and Toto. What was the author thinking? Fortunately the Jason and the Wizard of Oz scenerio is pre-empted to go to another scene and then rejoined as the character is finishing. Thank god!    Planet of the Beast has a better second half, but it was still painful to digest. I thought the action could have been a lot better, the urgency of the characters wasn't described good enough.  I also notice several typo's and misspelled words throughout the book.  Bottom Line......try to keep yourself awake reading this one 
 This is just a collection of interviews of a few unknown industry "insiders" making comments on what any fan already knows. There are only a few minutes of clips of Britney, nothing new here either. You would expect to find a DVD of this quality in the $3.99 Clearance bin. Save your money for REAL Britney concert and music DVDs, you will see better news stories about her on Access Hollywood or Entertainment Tonight 
 I have to admit, I have forced myself to listen to Michael Weiner's abortion of a talkshow more than once.In a way it's almost humorous, until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously, they view him as a deep political thinker. He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't. What this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual. One would find more insightful comments at your state's mental hospital, or by a survey of several of your town's homeless population. I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it. The average IQ of the nation would increase, and perhaps we would then be able to listen to REAL political discourse, instead of a bunch of ignorant, partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another. 
 This film has many, many interesting ideas in it. I think it has an original cast of characters. I admire Brian DePalma for making his own brand of films.  Unfortunately, "Femme Fatale" is one of those films that will do ANYTHING to twist the plot in an alternate direction --disorienting the audience and supposedly giving the film depth. Alas, you need a strong plot in order to do this (see Memento) effectively. What's worse, other than the major twists (the biggest of which is just GOOFY), there are way, way, way too many coincidences and visual gags which just pollute things further.  DePalma has had this problem with many of his films. One that comes to ming is "Obsession". Twists work best when there are 1,2, maybe 3 -- such as in "Dressed to Kill".  The set-pieces themselves do not approach his best work, and Stamos is unendearing, almost irritatingly vulgar and nasty at times. In order to be a "Femme Fatale" she should be able to work both sides flawlessly 
 This book is sponsored by the American Council for Cultural Policy and is an excellent illustration that this organization is completely devoid of ethics. The various articles in the volume detail how the 'innocent' art and antiquities dealer and collector could and should be protected by U.S. law, all the while defaming the rights and plight of Native Americans, victims of Nazi appropriations, and countries suffering from massive art market-driven looting, to name only a few. Property laws figure heavily in these debates, but naturally the question of how stolen or looted art and antiquities become the 'property' of collectors and dealers is answered in such ways as to show the dealers and collectors as the true victims of both the thefts and the judicial systems. Although the book is claimed as a balanced discussion of the many complex issues surrounding the ownership of cultural property, it is clearly in the corner of the wealthy dealers and collectors (and their lawyers). 
 Gad!  Such a looooooong book!  This would better be called "A Year (or Maybe 5) in Only Part of the World" since most of the places visited were European.  Long-winded and loopy with adjectives, Mayes writes about food, literature, food, art, food, architecture, and food.  I'm surprised she and her husband don't roll around the places they visit - they must each weigh a ton or two by now.  I did enjoy the descriptions of the crazy Italian traffic HOWEVER I got a wee bit tired of hearing how fantastic European cities are compared to poor little ole' San Francisco.  Traffic bad in Portugal?  Look at San Francisco!  Beggars in Naples?  Just look at San Francisco!  No place is perfect, and I'd much rather read travel stuff written by someone who has a more balanced prospective.  
 This book was used in part, for a class on the in Classics on the Age of Homer.  This book describes early Greek life and culture in depth, yet at the same time seemed to be way over my head.  The text is very longwinded and confusing for someone who has not met the material before, and would not recommend it as a book to read in your pasttime.  Rather, the book is very thorough, and would make for great refernce material, giving an in depth perspective to  early Greek culture 
 Okay, maybe I am the odd ball, but this author drove me crazy!  He should have made a pamplet instead of a book.  I felt as though it was written by a Amway sales person.  To me, the book read like they were trying to motivate you to go ahead and build your house.  I needed factual information, and I got 90% "You can do it" and 10% "This is the stuff you need".  If you are two years away from building, you might like it, but I was two weeks away and already had most of the information provided.  I am sending mine back 
 "Sweet Baby Jane" Perkins is a mega-selling rock star in need of a bodyguard and Jason Wilson, an ex-Army Ranger, is her man!   This is the first time I read a book by Cindy Gerard and maybe I should have tried a little bit harder, but it was a real struggle just to finish the first 50 pages. So it could be I didn't give it a fair chance.... but here's what I think.  The first thing that bothered me, was the fact that someone in the band is harassing Jane. I don't find the sexual harassement and obnoxious behavior believable: who is this guy anyway?? He is not the star of the show, he should have been fired long ago. Problem solved, but I guess he is needed for the storyline. What finished my attempt to continue to read the book is the fact that after something really awful has happened, Jane decides not to confide in the one person who stood by her all these years and made her in the star she is (namely her manager Max), for fear that he would cancel the gig. If I had read on I might have learned all the reasons why she feels that - no matter what - the show must go on. But frankly I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters and their lines and their emotions (up to page 50) just fell flat.   So..... for sale: a (hardly) used book in excellent condition! 
 I don't think this toy could have been made any cheaper.  Ours is cracked in several places, even though it's hardly been played with...  My kids really are not hard on toys, and are destroying this one.  We also had bought the drumset from Little Tikes, but returned it, because it broke before I could even assemble it.  Disappointing.  This keyboard just doesn't live up to my expectations from Little Tikes products 
 I am not by any means a squeamish person. In my relatively brief tenure on this planet, I've seen first-hand a great many things the 'average' individual might deem repulsive, repellent, unsavory, unseemly. Finally purchased this book ( a first-edition, no less ) at an independent record store, owing primarily to it's hipster cred as 'the' book to own for those in-the-know. While there is very little in this title that was a complete surprise to me ( in my varying lines of employment, I discovered early on that the human animal's capacity for cruelty and attendent perversion is virtually limitless ), to have all the various pecadilloes ( and their sub-genres ) represented between the pages of a single book that could be carried around as easily as the latest Tom Clancey crapfest was something akin to discovering that you possessed a vial containing every known social disease, and a few that were as-yet unclassified - good to know, but do you really want this thing lying around your house? In my case, no. Interesting book, I 'get' the point ( the human race is bipedal ape scum, and we're all going to hell in a handbasket ), but this is the first time I have ever felt moved to drop a book in the trash, and I am a compulsive book-buyer/reader, with literally thousands of titles lining the shelves. Just not this one. Not anymore.  
 As another earlier reviewer appropriately stated, this book is not for a Classics Scholar. Having read a large number of different translations of the Aeneid and having translated about 80% of the text from the original Latin myself, Fitzgerald's translation here is lacking in many aspects. He does not keep with the same lines as the original text, he takes great liberties in the use of various words, and sometimes his grammatical poetics is overly drammatic for the section of translation. While the Aeneid is a poem, one must consider that an Epic poem is not a Haiku.  If you're looking for an English translation to use in conjunction with a Aeneid translation course, seek another book. I prefered David West's translation when I was taking a few courses in college.  The Aeneid is a wonderful story, just don't read Fitzgerald's translation of it 
 been using the product for 6 months now - battery time isnt great - I constantly need to recharge the battery.  People always complain of an echo 
 Both 100' spools of this wire came in TWO pieces.I discovered that I'd have to splice it halfway through a difficult install. URHHHH!!!! Avoid these problems by buying other vendor's products 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 Expecting sexy camp in the tradition of "Beyond Valley of the Dolls" I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Instead I struggled through this tedious, repetitive, and confusing mess of a film. I respect what the director was trying to create, but the end product is nearly unwatchable. It's starts out so well too.... "I tried not to remember why I buried my trumpet." ...but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that isn't the least bit sexy or interesting. I know this film has a sizeable cult following. It is pretty to look at (sometimes when it isn't in grainy slow-motion) but I just couldn't make it through. Maybe it's worth a look, but I personally wish I had rented it 
 Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."  Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished. 
 I thought it was a very interesting, creative, inspiring book.  It gave me some things to think about and i enjoyed the pictures of her quilts.  
 After loving her on Getz/Gilberto#1, I bought this album and was disappointed b/c it has a much more loungy and symphonic feel--too done for my taste.  You'll hear strings and a many more instruments than Getz/Gilberto#1.  Her voice is pretty and mellow as always.  Maybe it will grow on me, but right now, I'm pretty disappointed 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 Mrs. Baker has spun a very interesting tale, indeed. But after careful reading, it is clearly a product of both "retroactive fact production" and some "fancy fictional footwork." So, to use Barr McClellan's (author of Blood, Money & Power: How L.B.J. Killed J.F.K) term, "faction," "Oswald a True Story" appears to be a blend of both "faction" and "fiction." And while one cannot dismiss it out of hand, as is customary with most of the JFK assassination literature, one has to tread carefully and have a very refined and finely tuned "crap detection system" in order to sort what is "faction" from what is "fiction."   In this regard, it must be said from the start that Mrs. Vary-Baker's story has so many twists and turns that it quickly overwhelms a linear mind.  It is a detail-filled microcosm, loaded with names, dates, receipts, recollections, mental recreations, and improbable events -- few of which can be independently verified.  In short, it is a unverifiable scatological laundry list that converges, often improbably and always too neatly, with most of New Orleans based JFK assassination lore.  But as an integrated whole, these disparate parts seem to add up to much less than the sum of their parts.  Put simply, as a self-contained whole that is devoid of her unverifiable "factions," which appear to be a heavily edited memory dump of her stream of consciousness of those times, her story does not hold together very well.   It is strong (excruciatingly so) on inessential and often inane romantic details that supposedly occurred between she and Lee, and weak on everything else - especially on connecting the dots between the motives she attributed to her overseers, their involvement in her own clandestine activities, and their ultimate (perhaps unknown) objectives and roles in any of the plots, including in the possible plot to assassinate JFK.  Basically her story is a chronology of her roughly five-month romantic relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald. According to her, they met accidentally and then discovered together that they were being used as clandestine operatives in larger schemes above their heads - to wit: to develop a "galloping cancer" that Lee would then "hand deliver" to Cuba to kill Castro. Mrs. Vary-Baker alludes to the fact that, at the time, Lee was working on a clandestine project for RFK, although the purpose of this critical mission is never made clear or further elaborated upon. Then, due to a serendipitous event, hurricane Hugo, the "kill Castro" mission was apparently aborted and Lee was reassigned or redirected (or "turned" to either kill JFK or) to "stop" a developing plot to kill JFK. According to Vary-Baker's version, Lee was then double-crossed by his cloak-and-dagger cohorts and became the "pasty" in the crime of the century.   While it is entirely possible that Mrs. Baker could have met such an enormous cast of important players many of whom were implicated in the JFK assassination and the Cuban intrigues. And while it is also possible that she could have been involved in several critical events in the clandestine war against Castro, it is extremely unlikely that they could have all come together in her life, and "on cue," as they repeatedly did in the tale she spins in this book.  It may also seem plausible to some that Mrs. Vary-Baker operated under the clandestine control of a coalition of Texas politicians and oil barons; that she worked hand-and-glove with renegade CIA and FBI operatives; that she was a junior (fresh out of high school) researcher in a clandestine and illegal underground research lab with world-class medical experts engaged in leading-edge cancer discoveries; that she moved about on the margins of the Carlos Marcello arm of the Louisiana mob as well as within the circles of anti-Castro fanatics; that she met and had dinner with Jack Ruby; partied at Clay Shaw's residence; worked on cancer research with David Ferrie and renown surgeons Drs. Alton Oschner and Mary Sherman; and that she also met and engaged in a clandestine romance with accused Presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.   Yes, it is possible that Mrs. Vary-Baker was indeed a virtual "Agent Zero" at the center of gravity of the New Orleans wing of the JFK assassination intrigue, but how plausible is it? Can such a story really be independently verified? And most of all can it be as pristine and as "pat" as she has made it out to be?  Where her story gets murky is on "ALL" of the essential details and explicit connections, which she glides over effortlessly. That is, whenever her plot demands direct and explicit connections between the people who she thinks are controlling her, their motives, and her and Lee's relationship to these people and those motives, each time she comes up excruciatingly empty. The reader is left to fill-in these very essential blanks himself, by making the necessary logical leaps in inference based on what her trail of "facts" insinuate. If it were any other issue but the JFK assassination, it would be easy enough to let these matters slide, but since it IS the JFK assassination, it is all the more reason that such connections must be made, and made explicit.  Thus a great deal of her plot is indistinguishable from one that has been created by working backwards from known facts and composing a story to fit the facts retroactively. As a result her facts always dovetailed "just a bit too neatly and too exactly" with known events, known decisions, known personalities, and their known movements during the periods in questions.    Since she has appeared on "60 Minutes," to some, all this must have seemed plausible, but to those like myself willing to suspend judgment and give her the provisional benefit of the doubt (pending substantiation of facts), her tale still stretches credulity.   Alarm bells keep going off in my "crap detection system" to the effect that there is a big problem here with the "retroactively reconstructed and neatly dovetailing pre-determined facts;" never deviating even once from what was previously known. How can this be? And even though her facts are always carefully lined up, the reader is still left to insinuate the connections between them and the larger events and motives that eventually unfolded and which she claims her "facts" are so intimately associated with and attached to.   For instance, although she supposedly works closely with Dr. Mary Sherman, the book reports only one conversation between the two of them, the rest of the connections are to be inferred through insinuations and extrapolation. The same is true with Lee. Although she claims to be in a deep love affair with him, there is little substantive dialogue between the two of them about what Lee himself, was up to.  Why for instance did Lee come all the way from Dallas to work for Bannister? Why was Lee such a willing tool of such an obviously evil cabal? Why did he not extricate himself in time to avoid being "played" as a patsy? Did he ever report what he learned to his legitimate authorities? Etc. And the same for her: If she and Lee knew at the time that the JFK assassination was "going down" why not sound an alarm? Go to the newspapers, etc.?  I remain unconvinced that there is any meat here.  Two stars 
 I saw this dvd the other day and I didn't really have high expectations so I wasn't that disappointed.  The movie skewers most of the recent teen flicks and even some of the classics from the 1980's.  The movie, pretty much follows the story of "She's All That," and the few good bits in this movie center around that movie.  The rest is mostly unfunny gross out bits that I expect are supposed to appeal to the late teen and early twenty something crowd.  Honestly though I think even the target audience will cringe at most of those.  I mean a couple of incest gags?  A twenty something girl making out with an old lady?  Ewwwwwww!  The one orginal scene that had me rolling was near the end where the lead character explains to Laney what the future of there relationship would be.  That scene alone gives this movie an extra star.  There is a cameo by Molly Ringwald that is also cute.  Unless you are in the mood for a teenage "comedy" that relies on grossout, I'd pass on this 
 Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep 
 The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be "Moving Pictures".   Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to. 
 It's okay, but I wouldn't see it twice. It was entertaining, but their acting is not very good and you can tell right away it's never going to win an award 
 After seeing all the glowing reviews of this book, I'm beginning to wonder if it's just me. I've only gotten through the first 3 chapters and already I've run into a multitude of terms that are not explained at all. My class uses this book for its text and I have to answer discussion questions about brand-intensive vs. capital intensive, disaggregation and reaggregation (Dictionary.com didn't even have 'reaggregation' in its database), etc. It sure would be nice to include a glossary of terms used. I'm really dreading the rest of this book 
 I purchased this item as a filler. I have two steamers already that are 5+ yrs old. First of all i found this item to be smaller than i expected. Secondly, i washed this item as instructed and left it out to air dry (as i do with my others without any problems), on the second day i noticed some dark blemishes on the underside. These eventually turned into numberous dark spots on the underside on both basket parts of the steamer. I have never experienced this before! They were deep into the bamboo, this item had just been steamed then washed in very hot water and allowed to air dry... i have no idea how this happened? I used one of my others at the same time and it never developed this problem. I returned the item to Amazon. 
 I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy. However, this third book needs some serious time in the Intensive Book Surgery Unit before it should have even been published. Frankly, this manuscript should have been kicked back from the editor to the author and refused. I realize that's a pretty heavy thing to say, but it's true. Something went badly wrong here.  The author did not do his job in bringing his protagonists to closure; having two kids fall in love, then decide to live apart for the rest of their lives is a complete crock. Puhleaze. I grew to rather like the aeronaut Texan and the explorer, and they're killed to little point. Puhleaze. Iorek the Bear is darn cool, and he barely (sorry) makes an appearance in book 3. Puhleaze. And, by the way, who is Mary, introduced so late in the trilogy, as an underfunded Dark Matter physicist (who just happens to be ... an ex-nun ... now, just wait a minute here, is that heavy handed or what?)... and Dark Matter would be *under* funded? Puhleaze. (Although these days, she'd be working on Global Warming.) And Mrs. Coulter, in a lifetime full of being evil, suddenly has a turn of heart (yes, just like The Grinch), and, in her new fullsome of goodness, helps kill an angel. Huh? What? Say that again?     I was thrilled (not) at Pullman's description of an endless, boring ... [come to think of it, very much like reading Volume III of this trilogy] ... somewhat-Purgatory-Without-Dante's-Skill that apparently is his vision of death. Everyone stands around being ... boring. Gosh, how exciting, what a vision, et cetera. It's duller than the endless views of the Enterprise in Star Trek I. It's more boring than the endless endless views of the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When the dead people standing around there are given the chance to decompose, they go for the gusto. As to why any of this should be in a book, I can only offer my puzzlement.       Jerry Pournelle once gave me some terrific advice. "Never give a reader a chance to put down one of your books, because if you do, they will, and they'll never pick it up again.". I zoomed non-stop through the first two books of this trilogy. The last book took me a week plus and I was extremely annoyed with it.   I was amused that Philip Pullman, in his Afterword, gives credit to stealing his ideas (those are his words) from Paradise Lost (John Milton). Frankly, I wish he had stolen more, this book would have been better. His utter hatred of The Church shines through this book. He has sort of an Idiot's Guide to Quantum Mechanics but isn't up on it.     This mess needs to be storyboarded, and everything that does not PROMOTE THE STORY needs to be chucked out. And that's about half of this book. Whoever edited this book badly needs to be chewed out. I suspect, though, that it boiled down to "not enough time to fix" in the publishing schedule; Del Rey is not noted for publishing messes like this.  
 The Sacred Romance is rambling and incoherent.  The author's nearly irrelevant personal reflections litter the chapters and do nothing but complicate extremely simple concepts.  If you read this book, you will spend 25% of your time reading and 75% struggling to make sense of what you read 
 McMaster has taken upon himself the task of blaming the civilian leadership in the U.S. for the disaster in Vietnam.  How they misled and lied to the public and ignored the advice of the military.    That is true but his deliberate slanting of the evidence to prove his point damages what is a well-documented interesting book.  General Harkins comes off in this book as a man doing the right job but who was ignored by Lodge.  In fact, although he was ignored, Harkins clearly was pollyanish in saying things were going well when they weren't.  As the Bright Shining Lie makes clear, the countryside was falling to the Viet Cong during Diem's regieme (Harkins' time) and did not suddenly happen when Diem was overthrown as McMaster seems to indicate.    In addition, General Westmoreland continued the optimistic vein of Harkins.  He ignored the advice of his Marine commanders about sending Marines into the Khe San area and other areas the NVA and Viet Cong were strong and so suffered many losses.  Yet McMaster doesn't focus on the weakness and bad decisions of Westmoreland because the General.    The only  military member that McMaster severely criticizes is Taylor and that is because he "sold" out to McNamara. In point of fact, LeMay who comes off relatively well in this book was a nut whose preference was to bomb North Vietnam so much we could pave the entire country and then plant a victory flag.  Some victory if you kill all the people. The JCS was not united as McMaster does admit.    This book is well documented and covers a fascinating topic, the deliberate misleading of the American public in Vietname.  However, McMaster's failure to be objective dramatically weakens the book.   His criticism of McNamara and Johnson is well documented.  However, in his desire to prove his main thesis and, I suspect because of his loyalty the military, caused McMaster to gloss over the failure of the JCS and Harkins/Westmoreland, and to ignore the fact that rural Vietnam was largely lost long before Diem's overthrow.    Although not perfect, A Bright Shining Lie does a much better job of describing this sorry tale. 
 type smudges / translation bad / in short, a disposable boo 
 THe container of DVDs had been cut open, apparently before packaging for shipment.  Over twenty discs were missing, and the remainder were covered with dust and debris.  The discs were packed loosely, and rolled freely inside the box.  Amazon sent me a label to print out for return shipping of the box for a refund, but it's been a week and a half since I mailed it back and I have yet to receive acknowledgement 
 I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also. 
          I was reading this magazine at work, and I consider it to be a trashy magazine. It only focuses on the sexual part of women, like if sex is the best thing in the world, because they had this article in which a girl was riding a taxi, and she thought the taxi guy was fine, so she unbutton her shirt and told the taxi guy to touch her breasts. And then she says it was the *best experience she ever had. I just cant believe they publish garbage like that, giving the message to women that its ok to undress yourself with a total stranger, who you dont even know. I prefer to read things that focus more on the inner heart, on the emotional, and spiritual side of things. And read books that will help me be a better person right now and the future, and throw away the garbage this society has 
 My god what have these guy's done. What a mixed mess. Josh Silver used to produce a band called pist-on and there cd was called NO 1. Well this should be called NO 2. Because it sure smells like it. Better yet there last cd should have been called DEAD and this one DEAD AGAIN. ILL bet Roadrunner Records are glad to get rid of these guy's. They take a 10 minute song and make it sound like 20 minutes, Its like the energizer bunny it goes on an on and on and on. They have one song that sounded pretty good but than they have to ruin it with a stupid Russian chant. It's an old saying if it ain't broken don't fix it. You guy's better go back listen to some of your old cd's and WAKE UP, WAKE UP. Call you next cd Awake Again 
 Liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money. Thought it'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else. But instead i've paid and never received it. I haven't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else, so this is the first chance i've had to even say i've been ripped off. They may eventually send it but it's not likely at this point, it's been a couple months now 
 I wish I could give Ms. Anderson a more favorable review as I am an avid long time student of metaphysical principles and was really looking forward to reading this book - I liked the catchy title.  However, I must admit that I really didn't find any new breakthroughs here or new suggestions to improve my 'field playing' skills.  I also didn't particularly care for the constant references to Ms. Anderson's career - I would have liked to hear more examples of other 'players'.  Although this is simply my personal perception, Ms. Anderson's style makes her come across as rather self-absorbed when it comes to her 'abilities'.  This book will most likely not become part of my permanent collection on quantum physiscs and the art of manifestation.  I will stick with the classics instead - James Allan, Neville, Abraham-Hicks, Grabhorn, Goldsmith, Dyer, Hawkins, F.A. Wolf.      
 ...Dear God, please strike me blind! I'd rather see a test pattern than this piece of cra 
 I may never read another book.  Never has it taken anyone so long to never arrive anywhere.  At one point I actually lost the will to live, not because I empathized with any of the characters but because I could not believe I had another 90 pages to endure.  I am so glad it's all over 
 A dull tome, uninteresting and overpriced.  Might make a good doorstop perhaps, or be excellent for starting fires, but I wouldn't suggest the book to anyone I might run into again.    The author seems to have only a slight grasp of the subject.  Important concepts are overlooked, and it seems to have been written for ego gratification or to drum up business, rather than to explain the concepts of asset protection.  Take a pass on this one.   
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 This book is a waste of paper. It is extremely hard to follow  and it actually puts me to sleep when I read it 
 Any attempt to analyze the Hemingway/Fitzgerald friendship involves (at best) pure speculation and (at worst) cheap psychology. This book offers equal measures of both. Devotees of either of the two legendary authors  will no doubt already be familiar with the anecdotes recounted in Hemingway  vs. Fitzgerald. For them, this book is a dry well. (And who, besides this  group, would be interested in the book in the first place? 
 I only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute.  Other than that they were quite unusable.  I usually wear a size 7 but I could not even get my foot into these shoes...and they are quite hard.  Had to get rid of them 
 I write this review as I struggle to make myself finish watching this movie.  I've talked myself out of stopping it about 3 or 4 times, but I'm no quitter I'm going to persevere until the end.  The story line is so disjointed and the characters are disappointingly one dimensional. I've watched some really good independent black films like Love, Sex and Eating the Bones or 30 to Life, but Fair Game so far has been a waste of my time.  
 On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: "Extremely funny!". I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression 
 The little hardcover book fits nicely into a purse or tote, but the premade lists inside are not large enough, do not have enough spaces.  For example, the To Do list is very short.  I love the Moms Plan It Calendar and this is my 3rd year in a row using one, but I am not happy with this product 
 I have ordered new this twice from Amazon. Both times Amazon took my order with estimated 7 days to ship. Both time Amazon keeps delaying shipment with no prospect in sight. I do not beieve that it is stiil in print or available new from Amazon 
 Just finished reading this 451 pages book.   I think that the main character Vincent is pretty disgusting. He's weak, humble and miserable. When I was reading around page 400 I was tempted to close the book and return it, only the desire to find out how it all ended kept me from doing that.  Vincent is the bold example of a man who is not in charge of his destiny, he is not even in charge of his house and his time. His coworker bullied him into going from house to house to advertise Bible study classes, she painted the walls of his house with her positive thinking quotes.   So the verdict - unless you are really bored or interested in Chinese way of living - don't read it 
 Hehe, O.K. I bought the book -- it's not the first time I've thrown away money and won't be the last. After skimming through it and reading this guy's life story, which includes "voices" psychics, and god-knows what else, I can say that I refuse to waste my valuable time reading this clap-trap. Let me suggest that everyone thinking about buying this book, read THIS book first you will be doing yourself a lifelong favor 
 With great anticipation, I purchased this CD but it came in some obscure "Super Audio CD" format by Sony. It is unplayable on my CD player and unreadable on my laptop. The Amazon product description does not designate this. Bummer. Now I have to go through some return/replace hassle 
 I am reviewing the audio version of the book.  I would give this zero stars if I could, only because of the narration.  As usualy, Dave Barry is very funny, but it doesn't come through in this version because it's impossible to get past the narrator's reading.  In a word, he is AWFUL.  He sounds like a combination between a bad Paul Harvey impersonator and the adult voice of Ralphie in "A Christmas Story."  His timing and inflection are totally wrong for the material and he completely ruins the whole book.  I couldn't get through one of the five CDs before I wanted to throw the thing out the window.  It would have been great if they had used someone like Harry Anderson (who played a fictionalized version of Dave on TV a few years ago) to read this, and then perhaps Barry's humor would have come through.  If you like Dave Barry, skip the audio book and read the paper version 
 I can not recommend this book to any qualified woodworker.  It contains little useful information.  The author devotes a lot of space to safety and tools and even spends an entire chapter on workbenches, but the title promises info on designing and building a woodshop.  Is this his version of bait and switch? Also, few woodworkers need to be told that a table saw needs space in front and behind for materail handling.  And fewer still need to know that a good shop requires adaquate lighting and electrical. Most prospective buyers should get some other book. If you are an absolute novice, then there may be enough ideas here to justify the purchase price.   
  Thousands of little girls, armed only with bamboo spears and knives , are able to overcome an army of thousands of adult, Chinese revolutionaries? Many of the men are killed, but not one of the little girls is hurt? Does this seem plausible? A large group of intelligent, well educated men and women copy the culture and social structure of Victorian England? Is this reasonable? Absurdities compounding absurdities throughout the book.   Protracted , boring sections detail Nell's Fairy Tale adventures seeking magical keys in different castles. Nell's fantasy adventures are the primer's method of teaching and helping Nell to become a young woman who can think for herself and survive in a hostile world. OK , but there was too much of this for my taste.  With the possible exception of Nell, the characters lacked depth, they didn't fully come alive for me. We need to learn more about them, their backgrounds and motivations.  There were some interesting descriptions of nanotechnology, individual atoms being assembled into microscopic machines. Matter compilers essentially give people everything they need instantly. How would such technology affect our lives and culture? This was thought provoking and is the reason I gave the book two stars instead of one. There is the potential for a very good book here, but this isn't it 
 ...that they even made it this far and to 11. Seriously now, Kidz Bop has to stop ruining decent songs that a lot of people like. I'm pretty sure that these 20something idiots that give this 4 or 5 song reviews have no taste in music. What even shocks me more is that this sold really well in it's first week. You know the saying, IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 Ronald Takaki has written a book which presents the "Revisionists" view of why the U.S used the atomic bombs on Japan in the waning days of World War II. His thesis is that the bombs were dropped because Americans in general and Harry Truman in particular were racists. The bombs were in effect a racially motivated revenge attack on innocent Japanese civilians. His second thesis is that Harry Truman, insecure and bullied as a child because he wore glasses and played the piano now had the ultimate weapon to prove his manhood. Takaki uses as his sources for these conclusions, magazine articles, letters to editors and anecdotal conversations with "real" Americans. The value of Takaki's book is as a readable counterpoint to mainstream historical writing - it might provoke discusion and thought. The reader should bear in mind that Takaki has "an axe to grind." If you are looking for a more balanced view on the topic of why the atomic bombs were used on Japan try J. Samuel Walker's "Prompt and Utter Destruction." In his book Walker cuts through the political posturing and tries to present the facts and his opinions in a logical, balanced way. Historian Gar Alperovitz (another revisionist historian) dismisses Walker's book as "a mere 110 pages" - that in itself recommends the book as an interesting read.   
 I would have given this 3 stars just to be polite to a man whose music I respect very much but with all of the 4 and 5 star reviews on this site, someone needed to step in and provide some balance. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is nice and EC's cover of The Sky Is Crying is pretty good  but I'd lean toward Elmore Jame's original or SRV's before this one.  I'm a long-term EC fan, from his days with the Yardbirds on.  If I had a penny for every time I've listened to him play a tune, I'd probably own Amazon!  So I love the man and his music and I'm not calling this a BAD disc.  I'm just trying to put some dynamic range in the rating process.  There are people out there that use these reviews to make buying decisions and if you're one of them, I'd hope that you already had at least 20 Clapton CDs before you point your credit card at this one.  
 I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days.  The bag, on the other had, leaves a bit to be desired.  While the material used is soft, the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 Granted, it must be challenging to be a writer when one's father is Arthur Miller. This book was receiving raves and I was so surprised to discover it was basically downright bad! Unreadable, frankly. I forced my way through the stories. They were full of cliched and vague descriptions, bland dialogue, and too many oh-so-quirky characters. More than one story had flashbacks ( one story had two: A 4 years ago flashback within a  1 year ago flashback). More than one story had a character recounting her dreams. Boring!!!!  Save your money and your time. 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 I found this an interesting book, but not that believable.  Ryall claims to be describing a family tradition (famtrad) of Wicca not connect to Gardnerian or Gardnerian derived Wicca.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to hold water, and most people who know about the subject don't believe her claims.  Still, it is an interesting read 
 It reminds me of uthanizm. I did not like it. Theres no hard songs. I'm a die hard Lynch fan. If I your not down with uthanizm don't buy it. Its a dissapointment. I think  
 I am truely grateful for this feedback forum!  One has to read very carefully to ascertain that this DVD only contains a FEW of these two fine series.  AND at such a price!  I concur with many others that for the price, I expected to receive BOTH series - COMPLETE.  It seems that Disney offered one thing and delivered another!  The ol' bait and switch scam 
 You really need to be careful when reading this book.  Understandingly, people facing the challenges of ADD/ADHD are stressed out and overly receptive to a voice like Hartmann's.  Strangely unprofessional, Hartmann offers a "soft ball" lob to those looking for a feel good camp-fire-like discussion of the challenges of ADD/ADHD.  This is not a productive way to approach these challenges.  Overcoming these challenges takes discipline, a manner of thinking totally absent in Harmann's writing.  I would go so far as to say that the author's writing style, the manner in which he presents his ideas, and the thinking behind those ideas represents the worst, rather than the most optimal aspects, of traits associated with ADD. Beware 
 I just don't have much to say about this one.  I have so enjoyed the previous books in this series, but was quite disappointed with this one.  Everything from the story line to the writing style was terrible.  I wanted to read about the ladies that I have grown to love, but this story was about the other residents of Covington with hardly a word about Grace, Hannah and Amelia. The only reason I finished it was because I actually spent money to purchase the book instead of checking it out at the library.  Otherwise, I would have put it down and never picked it up again.  I hope the next book lives up to the quality of the others before this one 
 this is one lousy expensive player.  as one of the reviewer mentioned, the hinge on the battery unit will break.  i had the unit replaced by the manufacturer as part of the warranty.  but, after a few weeks, it broke again, at exactly the same spot.  AudioVox refused to have it replaced again because the 90 day warranty period is over.  Also, it constantly freezes playing home made DVD movies, regardless of the format of the DVD disc, not to mention I can hardly read subtitle text.  i wish they had a money back guarantee 
 Difficult to install, doesn't fit right, water sprays all over the place once it is installed.  Then it only lasted for 1-2 months with minimal use - three bathrooms in home.  Not 12 months as claimed.  Waste of money 
 I am a huge Tim Powers fan, but this book was extremely disappointing.    1.  There is no sense of place.  Powers usually makes you enjoy his locations and they become part of the story.  Despite knowing the general location, there is not a single thing interesting about the location.  2. Boring characters.  Some of the Mossad agents are mildly interesting, but the protagonist and the villains are cardboard.  I didn't care about them at all.  I didn't even care who ended up victorious.  3. Bad use of magical background.  Time travel, other dimensions, psychics.  Sounds good right?  The Anubis Gates meets Last Call?  Not even close.  Everything is meagerly developed.  Supposedly the bad guys want to become gods, but the whole thing is discussed in one or two paragraphs.  4. Boring plot. There is no excitement, no sense of dread, no sense of wonder at all.  Overall this book was a total dud compared to his other books.  Good writing as usual, but not much else.  Tim, What happened here? 
 I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't.  So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, "Very Bad Things" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.  
 I am surprised that when people read the printed word, they believe it, whether the words are true or not. There are many glowing reviews here but only a few really call this book what it is, its fiction. This book would be a great novel and it reads like one. The author takes himself for a talented writer in his eloquent but very disjointed writing style. I never knew where I was in the time line in this book. What really turned me off was the part about flying blind down the canyon to escape the Mig. This part is straight out of, "Hunt for Red October", with Sean Connery. The Navigator "remembers" how the canyon looks so he can just time the turns while they fly blind. Flying a C-123 at 50Kts is pure BS. If you notice in the 12 months of flying, the author only talks about 2 or 3 incidents that are even remotely hair raising. He admits that in all the time the unit has been flying C-123', they have lost only one C-123. The rest of the book wanders back and forth in an effort to fill pages with text. Finally, the exciting ending with a night landing at a secret airfield caps this boring book. I also couldn't figure out why someone who hated the military so much spent 26 years in it. I flew as a pilot in the Air Force and I find this book unconvincing. Heed the few reviews that give this book one or two stars and find some thing more truthfull to read 
 'Secret Agent' (1996) stars very strong cast -- Bob Hoskins (also ex-producer), Patricia Arquatte, Christian Bale, Gerard Depardieu, Jim Broadbent, Eddie Izzard, and uncredited Robin Williams.  The music score is Philip Glass, and the director is Christopher Hampton, who made 'Carrington' before this one.  So the film should be better than average classic novel adaptaions, which it isn't.  This Conrad adaptation is sluggish, not knowing what it really wants to show.  One great disadventage is that we have seen the adaptation of this Joseph Conrad novel before -- Hitchcock's 'Sabotage' (1936) starring Sylvia Sydney.  (Not to be confused with the same director's film named 'Secret Agent.')  This version, not perfect to be sure, knows what it is doing, for the master of suspence turned it into a spy story with a thrilling sequence about a bomb hidden in a bag carried by an innocent boy.    However, the new version, though it is more faithful to the original novel, and proud of its great cast, has no sense of what it really is doing.  The film opens quite promisingly, with Bob Hoskins' Verloc, a shopkeeper in 1890s London, who actually is a spy in the pay of Russian embassy.  He is summoned by the Russain ambassador (very good Eddie Izzard), who tells Verloc to demolish one symbolic building in Britain with a bomb, the building which represents 'time' (you know where).  So far, interesting.  But as if to imitate the original novelist's slow moving narrative, the film unwisely introduces many flashbacks that tell us the outcomes of the botched plans.  Yes, Conrad uses (intentionally or not, I do not know) the confused narrative that seems to have lost the sense of coherent chronological order (read 'Nostromo').  Hampton not only employs this flashback method once, but twice (!) to show how Mrs. Verloc (miscast Arquatte) meets her fate.  So irritating.   The production designs are excellent, the acting is good all in all -- Jim Broadbent as police inspector and Robin Williams as The Professor around whose body a bomb is strapped are memorable among them -- and Philip Glass provides good socre.  However, all is wasted or misused, and even Glass's music starts to sound repetitious.  The film uses it when there is no need, and that is really annoying.  I like the atmosphere, and I don't think Joseph Conrad is a difficult material to make a film out of it (see 'Victory' made the year before).  But Christopher Hampton as director, though good as screenwriter, seems to have killed the material with heavy-handed direction.  And its characters that should be more interesting with a smooth story, too.            
 I have read some past reviews on this book, and i am shocked to find that college students have been using this book for learning. I am currently in high school and my teacher is making us read this book. I find this book very hard to understand. If anyone has any information or quick summaries of this book i would appreciate it. Thanks 
 Rabelais is much heralded for his skewering of the rich and powerful.  Frankly he does not measure up to Thomas More, Machiavelli, Erasmus or Castiglione or their writings.  Some may find his works clever or cute, they may certainly rattle pre-conceptions of the stiffness of the era.  As for me, it lacked wit and was mostly just crude, which some find to be groundbreaking but in fact crudeness has existed through out the ages 
 Huge pictures, fourteen half-pages of story leaves a young reader with a very vague picture of American history. 
 It is seldom that I leave a book without having finished it. It seemed to me to be extremely repetitive. John Self is (ha ha) an egotist advertisement-director Britishman who travels to the US to negotiate his first major film. An alcoholic and drug-addict, Self lives obssesed with a woman who cheats on him on a permanent basis. He gets drunk so many times it stops being funny. Amis can write and has a good sense of humor, but the story goes nowhere. Maybe other books by him are better 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 At times I enjoyed "Versailles".  At other times I found it maddening.  Some chapters are written in script format -including stage direction - I found this silly.  At other times, we 're treated to Marie-Antoinette's inner dialogue - or inner babble, depending on one's take.  Again, there were inspired sections but ultimately I felt she was trying too hard with the end result being inconsistent and just a little precious 
 I was expecting a book.  This is a packet of papers. The activities are shallow and the packet does not contain any activities more than what I could create on my own in a few minutes on the computer.  It focuses on vocabulary and does not include anything creative, motivational, or very little that will even move students to engage in higher-order thinking.  I am incredibly disappointed and will not be using any of the activities in my seventh grade classroom.  
 This book is mostly built around the idea "I wish it were true = it *is* true".  While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e. intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability 
 I got this book because the book claims to evaluate softswitch advantages as a Class 4 replacement. I work for a telecommunications company and one of our projects was to expand our long distance capability at the lowest costs possible. We evaluated the softswitches out there and determined the technology had not matured enough to replace hardware switches.  This book does explain the architecture and protocols, and for many SOHO's out there, it is a viable alternative. However, this book is deceptive in claiming that there is no reason not to immediately migrate from circuit switched Class 4 to a softswitch Class 4. After reading this book I believed that only configuration errors would stop migration, but my personal experience differs from the author.  I have experience to know that the softswitch products out there are either good for small scale migrations or as a MUX between real circuit switch hardware. Claims of Class 4 replacements are vaporware.  Because this book was the first one about softswitch does not make this a 5 star book. There is better white pages out there and sales literature that is better, and more realistic, than this book. I think the 5 star reviews are either shills or someone who has not read this book 
 Here is the commercial breakthrough of the worst group of the nineties. Songs like name & long way down define how lousy modern day rock has become. It doesnt get much worse than thi 
 We bought this phone two years ago.  While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features (I've especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets), we've found it to be extremely unreliable.  The problems we've had are listed below:  *very short battery life for the handsets *the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use *the handsets go "out of range" when one takes them only a modest distance from the base (even though we have the base in the middle of our house, the handsets don't work at the ends-- and our house is not that big) *the handsets randomly become "unregistered" from the base and have to be reset (this has only become a problem in the past month)  The issues we've had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone-- usually we'd expect such a purchase to last longer than two years 
 I enjoyed and learned a lot from both of Tanenbaum's OS textbooks, but this is really awful. On the one hand, the descriptions of things such as RPC are so abstract that I can't see how anyone could be expected to understand what a real RPC system would look like; on the other hand, there's not nearly enough effort made to give a picture of how the systems discussed fit into the broader context of computer science, or relate to each other.  Moreover, the book is badly written: the writing is alternately overly colloquial and overly academic in style, as if it were written by someone very smart, but for whom English is a second language 
    A Virtuous Woman is a book by Kaye Gibbons and is about a woman named Ruby Pitt who meets a guy named Jack Stokes one day when he spots her sitting at a picnic table. She was much younger than he was and was raised much differently than he was.Ruby was a widow but ends up married to jack.Jack was so in love with his wife through everything they went through even when she was diagnosed with cancer.They were opposites and when Ruby dies Jack is lost without her.They seemed to have an unusual relationship in my opinion. It was actually really hard for me to keep reading each page as i went on.It just wasnt a story that kept me wanting more!and that is why i gave it only 2 stars. i didnt even want to finish the book and that is why i think it took me so long to read it.It really dissapointed me seeing as how i loved Kaye Gibbons first novel, ELLEN FOSTER.i think that another reason i didnt enjoy the book is that there were too many characters to keep track of and it made the book a bit confusing.i really didnt like the transition of chapters either. it was a bit unorganized.There was no action in this novel and i'm sad to say that i dont reccommend it to anyone really 
 Our daughters received these for a Christmas present.  They were not able to use them.  I read and re-read the manual without any help.  Don't buy these 
 Twenty-something Bette lives in Manhattan, has a close knit group of friends, enjoys romance novels, and apparently possesses little fashion sense or celebrity IQ. Everyone Worth Knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations, and finds romance--real and fictional--along the way.   Maybe it's just me, but Bette seems to have problems many people would love to "suffer" through. Although told a lot of things about her, I never got the feeling I could really picture Bette or understand what she wanted, even in the end. Her story feels underdeveloped and many of the events predictable or random. Still, if you liked The Devil Wears Prada and enjoy modern formulaic romances, you will probably enjoy Everyone Worth Knowing 
 This book came highly recommended so I was looking forward to it but ended up very disapointed.  First off, this is a very thin, large font, tons of white space excuse for a book - there is very little to it and it isn't worth 5 bucks much less the list price of 20.  The book is fluffy, trite and idealistic at best.  The entire gist of the book is covered here in the Amazon description and all the value is there as well - no need to buy the book.  Skip this one 
 "Nonsuch" is one of those records that I think was doomed to failure-- having constructed (with a little help from Todd Rundgren) a thematic song cycle ("Skylarking") and an album of perhaps the best pop music in two decades ("Oranges & Lemons"), the bar was set pretty high for XTC, and in an attempt to reach it, they seemed to have overreached a bit.  It's not that the album is bad per se, it's just so carefully arranged and produced to have lost the edge that made its predecessors so great.  The band seems to have distilled themselves down to midtempo numbers, occasionally finding a bit of a driving electric sound (opener "The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead"), but largely sticking to a quieter, balladry style, often primarily piano driven.  Sometimes it works out quite nicely, the lovely, chirping staccato guitars on "Humble Daisy" provide ample support for a simply fantastic lead vocal by Andy Partridge, and certainly the lilting off-rhythm of "Then She Appeared" is downright captivating, but more likely than not, the pieces end up blending one into another as pretty much unmemorable pop songs that are inoffensive and ok but just not attention getting (Colin Moulding's "My Bird Performs", Partridge's "The Disappointed").  To cap things off, the album stretches over an hour long, and by the end of the record, even the more intriguing material ("The Ugly Underneath") seems to blend in with the rest.  It's tough though, becaue none of it is particularly bad, and in fact, all sorts of neat stuff is going on throughout-- great three part harmonies (Brian Wilson style with a falsetto over the top) catch the ear on "Dear Madam Barnum", "Wrapped in Grey" twists and turns every which way, "War Dance" features an intriguing clarinet opening that leads into a set of reeds providing support for Moulding's venomous lyrics... it goes on.  In fact, with such detailed arrangements, everything's guaranteed to be interesting in some regard, but what it lacks is that feeling of spontaneity and energy.  One nice thing is that at least with this reissue and its remastered sound, you can make out the subtleties of the record nicely.  Bottom line, there's a lot better by XTC-- "Nonsuch" is an ok record, but they've done a whole lot more 
 The Charlie Moon series is getting more amusing and more "spiritual", for lack of a better word, as it evolves. Certainly, Moon has become a more interesting character.  He was always more interesting than the earlier protaganist in the series Scott Parris. I enjoy the series but it is not my favorite reading. I find hiding of clues and information from the reader irritating.  
 I allready put up 2 reviews and I don't appreciate them being taken off by amazon because I highly believe that this book is BADDDDDD!  Amazon I know your trying to sell as many books as possible but you ever hear of a thing called free speech?? If your gonna only post positive reviews then don't bother even having people put up what they think about the books.  Geoff Houston might be a smart guy and all but this book??, my god what was he thinking writing something that puts people asleep every single line of his text?  Overall a BAD book, do not recommend to anyone 
 As I read this book I find myself believing that the author and editor have conspired together for the sole purpose of making this the longest book ever on the Tarot. IMNSHO, this text is 90% author/editor  interpretation of Jung and 10% Jung. I also have the following objections:  1) the author presents herself as "balanced" and even  "feminist," but the text clearly leans toward a Christian and  phalocentric interpretation of the Tarot; 2) the leaps in logic are  astounding, the author rambles into her own experiences for no apparent  reason, often seemingly forgetting her train of thought in the process, and  transitional expressions are entirely neglected between paragraphs; 3) the  depth of Jungian examination in this text is comprable to a survey course  in psychology. In short, I am VERY disappointed 
 This OBDII reader is way too simple. Doesn't really do much in diagnostic. Could not reset anything. Save up and buy a bit more better unit 
 First, I can not hide the fact that the author  put a valuable effort in this book, it is a good  book but still I have some criticism. like every  book when it deals with straight forward things,  it gives u full details but when it comes to real  stuff starts summarizing stuff. I can understand  this since the book talks about so many topics  however the main disadvantage of this book is that it did not succeed in giving the reader a good understanding on how is the code provided interacts with the engine. I do not know, I can not word it well but the key point as u proceed reading the book u feel like it is easy going but when u reach the real meat you start feeling that the writer started to rush. I have no problem with just summaries but what is important is the context, when u talk about the engine and scripts, u need to explain what the hell are these classes and call back functions that are just copied to this book. 
 Another left-wing, hippie idiot who dropped out of any sort of real career in 1975 has to sustain himself by writing this anti-technology dystopic rubbish.  I'm sure that he has plenty of ideological fellow travelers in Hollywood with whom he should team up to make another version of "12 Monkeys" or "The Fight Club."  This is just left-wing, nihilist, anti-human rubbish motivated by a hatred of humanity and mans' productive capacity.    Like, the world ended when we ran out of trees to burn as fuel?  I'm sure that trees were cheaper than coal for 15th or 16th century Britain, but they made the transition from one energy source to another without resorting to cannabilism or having their civilization self-destruct like this author would have us believe.  The collapse of civilizations is not tied to the end of cheap energy, but is more likely due to a descent into decadence and sloth.  If there is not enough oil, we can switch to coal, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and nuclear (fission or fusion-in the future).    All these self-styled futurists are just full of rubbish and make predictions which they then sell to an ignorant public just so they can pay their rent.  Most science fiction is garbage and this just proves my point.  How many science fiction authors in the early 1980's or before predicted the emergence of the internet?  Almost none by my estimate.  Don't waste your money helping this guy pay his rent.  He's a nihilist and misanthrope.    As long as men are free to think, communicate and trade, long-term optimism is the order of the day as the secular trend for civilization is always upwards and onwards 
 This book was not at all what I expected and I was very upset that I wasted my tme and money on it. It is not up to date with today's times at all. When I bought this book I s loking for an informational guide on the  joys of sex- instead I got a one sided opnion from a man who seems not to  be up to date with todays society. I dislike the way he referred to  homosexualty,transexuals,and experimental people as if they were wrong,and  they were not normal-very insulting and discrimminitory to those  individuals,and to me personally. So if you are looking for an outdated  medocre publication then this book would be just right for you 
 I do not know much about this item as I have yet to receive it. I have been waiting for four months, despite the estimated wait period being 2-3 weeks.  I will update this review upon receiving and reading the book, whenever that may be 
 This book focuses only on certain techniques and material (timber). A bit disappointing. 
 As a student of management I was eager to acquire this book when it first became available.  Please understand that my expectations for any book including one about the great Jack Welch are very modest.  If there is but one gem of wisdom within I am quite satisfied.  This book, however, not only lacked any gems of wisdom but it was also very poorly written with considerable punctuation and grammatical mistakes.  If Jack Welch had subjected this manuscript to his vaunted six sigma process (which he obviously did not) it would have never been printed.  I can sum up the substance of Welch's message with simplistic statement of work harder than everyone else and you will do better than they do.  I don't know if this is what Jack Welch intended or even accurately represents his true philosophy of management but it is the only thing he conveyed in his book. I regret the money I spent to be sure but even more so the time I wasted reading this drivel.  No self-respecting fish would allow itself to be wrapped in its worthless pages 
 American Juniors are just wannabe's of S Club 8! They take their songs, and sing them horribly! They also took some S Club 7 songs. American Juniors can't even BEGIN to compare themselves to S Club 7. These kids have some potential, but they really need to get their own music. Check out S Club 8/S Club Juniors and S Club 7 for the original songs, which are actually performed well 
 The novel features totally unbelieveable plots, cardboard cutout figures whom it is hard to identify with or sympathize with, the strangest motivations masquerading as realism and an off-the-cliff ending that is not satisfying. The sex is near-pornographic and not believeable to the point of being almost funny. The main character has the behaviour of a robot and seems to have no inner life or feelings.  The author hates liberals so badly I think he would personally like to go out and kill them bare handed; this axe to grind gets in the way of the development of a coherent plot. On the other hand, much of the writing is good in a technical sense, in spite of the often angry and sarcastic tone.  Many scenes are very interesting and well-written; the whole work just does not hang together, especially when you consider it is written by an experienced writer with a background at the CIA. This is not Ludlum, or Le Carre and I enjoyed Clancy more.  I like being entertained and told a nuanced story, not beat over the head by a heavy-handed piece of agit-prop so favored by the late unlamented Soviet Union.  However, the author does manage to tell what is on many levels an interesting story. He needed an editor to intervene 
 Tsukiyama knows hwo to write beautifully, BUT her metaphors and poeticisms feel too contrived. This novel is for lonely, flighty housewives. If you enjoy daytime soaps and/or exoticized perversions of the Asian culture, you'll love Dreaming Water 
 I found this book very depressing. Anne Lamott's constant self-deprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well. I know she is doing it to show that she's human just like the rest of us, but I think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets (saying the 9-year-old version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman, etc.) despite what she says about how you shouldn't do that. It's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models, it gets to you.  This is not a good book for people who are not sure they are writers. I am not a writer but I am interested in writing and I would very much like to write fiction but I have a lot of trouble writing authentically. Lamott sends the message that "As long as you're a writer, as long as you're in our secret little club, everything will be okay!" 
 When I bought this book I did not realize that it was written after the movie.  It is not good Graham Greene.  The book follows the movie closely but, it adds very little.  As I read the story I miss the music.  Save your money and buy the DVD 
 This review is for the MP3 audio cd.  Unless I received a faulty cd, this audio book was generated by an automated translation program. It's fraud. You don't pay to listen to a computer voice. I can't comment on the book 'Acres of Diamonds', which I was anxious to read/listen to, as this cd was so pathetic. [...]  
 I hate how this book protrays the father, as an unattached lion who watches tv rather than helping his son bloom. I bought this book for my autistic son for Christmas, read it and put it in the trash. It makes Dads look uninvolved and is not a good portrayal at all. My husband is an excellent father and certianly would not choose to watch tv over helping my son learn.  Very dissapointed in this book and honestly surprised by all these positive comments 
 While a good dvd by itself, its intentions are very bad. Most of the footage was stolen from several people who were planning to release it on a different dvd 
 I find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and I also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen TVs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen TV. These movies scream out for the widescreen, they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible. Yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen TV and, with one exception, all the people who have written about them dont seem to care. "Oklahoma", "Carousel", "South Pacific" and "King and I" need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen (also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well). Fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future (ie observe the two versions of "An Affair to Remember") of course, this is a major rip off, so anyone with a widescreen TV who has not bought these films --HOLD OFF, coz sooner or later they will get a proper release...How long? That is anybody's guess, but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen DVD technology ("Sound of Music" is fine and "State Fair" was made in non widescreen full screen format, an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen 
 The book is poorly written, full of fictional rantings and generally liberal recapping of other historial history books. The author rants like a lunatic and how this book was ever published is a mystery to me. 
 I have owned this unit for 2 years.  The water seems OK and definitely better than from the tap.  However, every 4 months or so we have to change the filter because we start to have a chlorine taste coming back.  The replacement cartridges are very expensive.  There is a little knob on the faucet that you pull to switch from tap to filter, and this knob recently has broken off.  We cannot seem to access the company's website to get a replacement part.  I am thinking to get a different water filter system altogether.  I would not buy again.  (Also, I have had lots of problems with their water bottles...leakage, breaking, etc.  I won't buy any product from this company again. 
 Let's consider 'Why Not Me' a trial run for Al Franken's better written follow-up 'Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.'  All of Franken's work bears the hallmarks of his sketch comedy background - it's an ensemble of pieces, some of which work, some of which don't.  In 'Lies,' roughly 80% or more of the pieces hit the mark (I wasn't a fan of the cartoons).  In 'Why Not Me,' it's about 50%.  Like the Bob Woodward parody ('The Void'), for example: funny for about the first five pages (you laugh when you see Franken's nailed Woodward's melodramatic scene-setting and habit of assembling conversations as if he were in the room).  But it drags on and on.  How many readers got though the whole piece?  Not many I bet.  Like others, I agree that the campaign diary worked the best, followed closely by the faux Newsweek piece - the classic campaign shot of Franken chopping wood with Golden Retriever at his side is a howler.  Talk about spot-on.  I think the best part of the entire book is the 'one issue' campaign (elimination of ATM Fees) and how Candidate Franken steers all discussion back to that point.  Watching both Bush and Kerry try to route every question back to stump speech set pieces makes you realize that there's sometimes a fine line between parody and reality.   
 This book was selected by my book club. I had never read Anna Quindlen before.  Rise and Shine was a disappointment to me.  I kept hoping that Meghan would somehow be redeemed, but that did not happen.  She is really not very likeable.  I thought there would have been more of a dialog between the sisters concerning Leo's tradgedy.  Meghan blamed her sister in one line and then it was never brought up again.  The book left me with an empty feeling.  It was not a satisfying read 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 maybe frankencrist if you really enjoy fresh fruit....this is a very annoying and bad b-sides album...california uber alles and holiday in cambodia are over-produced and watered down...and where is the killer intro to holiday in cambodia?  yeah i like jello biafra's voice and his mixture of funny and scary themes hit the spot, but this album consists of b-sides for a reason...aka they werent good enough to go on anything else 
 takes "Armis virumque" and gets "I sing of warfare and a man at war"?  The consensus in the reviews is that Fitzgerald has written a fine epic.  It just is not the same one written by Virgil.  If you want to read Fitzgerald, this is the book for you.  If you want to read Virgil you need the Mandelbaum translation 
 I am not sure why there are so many spinoff books of the show like this, or better yet why they get published. This book kept me fairly interested in the beginning, but it just fell very, very flat.  The ending is extremely STUPID, and absolutely corny.  Don't bother with this book, it wont fulfil your need for the show between episodes 
 I bought this Treat Ball with my Aussie puppy in mind; I wanted something that would keep her busy while in her crate AND something that she couldn't destroy within a few minutes. She had the actual chicken treat out of the ball within minutes; I replaced it. My other Aussie mix had it out of the ball within less than a minute. After the treat was consumed, they got to work on the ball itself...it's a great item for my dachshunds, but for the Aussies and the German Shepherd, it's hardly "Everlasting". Darn it! I was hoping I finally found something that the little herders couldn't immediately destroy 
 My 2 1/2 year old son loves this book and I think most children familiar with the movie will because it presents familiar characters and situations.  But it feels *so* incredibly tossed off!  The writing is slapdash, lackluster and just pathetically bad.  Good storytelling is more than just hitting the high notes of a film -- if you're going to bother making a book, it should read well *as a book*.  This book lacks the heart and soul that actually "animates" the movie 
 This book is great if you want to know how to raise goats in Europe, please don't get me wrong, I am from Germany and I have nothing against how things are done there, but the way the book discribes the keeping of goats is not the way it is done in the U.S. There is a big different in how goats are raised for meat versus how people raise them for show/milk or even just a for pets with or without horns. No real serious breeder of a Dairy goat in the U.S. would keep horns on a goat or even let the kids nurse. On the other hand most Meat goat breeder will not dehorn their goat and are upset if they have a goat they have to bottlefeed. There are many different ways to keep goats in the U.S. and they are not adequately discribed in this book.  Even thought there is a part where they discribe the "Goats of the world" the breeds discribed in the "Buying Goats" do not represent the popular goat breeds available in the U.S. For example for the choice of milking goat, they only give a choice of white Saanen and colored Saanen and no other breed is recomended. Yes, one really popular goat breed for milk in the U.S. is the white Saanen goat and in the U.S., the white ones are just called Saanen and the colored Saanen are called Sable, and Sable goats are not that easy to come by in the U.S. The most popular goat breed known for its really good tasting milk, the Anglo Nubian goat (usually just called Nubian goat), is not mentioned in this part of the book. Also in the U.S. the climate can be from tropical to very cold and some goats are better suited for colder or warmer climate and this is also not covered in the "Buying Goats" chapter, since the climate in Germany where this book is written doesn't differ in termperature like it does in the U.S.  In Germany not many different types of medication are available over the counter and there you have to go to the vet to get most medications, and here in the U.S. you can get a lot of things you would need to treat the most common illnesses right in your local feed store.  The same with dehorning and castratin goats, the animal protection laws are a lot stricter in Europe and dehorning and castrating of goats is usually not done by the farmer in Germany, but taken to a veterinarian. Here in the U.S., of course you can take your goat to the vet for this, but most breeders will do it themselves.  There is a lot of good information in this book, that is the same in all countries like how goats will rather eat weeds/trees instead of grass or how they digest their food. But many other things, are just not the same in the U.S.  I could go on and on how things normally done in the U.S. are not discribed, but I would have to write my own book to cover all of it. The bottom line is, I do not think that this is the right book to get for a novice that doesn't know what is available in the feed stores or wants to know about what goat to get if they live in the U.S. But I do think it is a good book to get if you already have goats and would like to know how other countries take care of goats or like to read some information that you look at with a open mind and pick what might work for you.  
 I have to say I agree with the prev. poster; this is just awful. Can you say "Norman Bates," people? Mom crawling on the floor to get into the kid's room? Weird.   The idea of the decrepit old mom being rocked to sleep by the grown man was so profoundly creepy I don't know where to begin. I'm surprised the next page wasn't Mom in a casket. *shudder*  Yes; these are some wonderful themes of acceptance, stages of life, etc FOR ADULTS.

 'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses.  Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a creepier experience.  Horror movie fans should like this, even though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it first 
 I actually bought this DVD over a year ago but just decided to watch it.  I'm a huge fan of Sidney Lumet, and I like Richard Gere, Gene Hackman, and the other stars in the film.  About 30 mins. into the movie the picture started distorting, and after that it would skip large chunks of the movie.  There was nothing visibly wrong with the DVD itself.  But, I saw enough.  Even before I reached the defective part, it was like watching a foreign film without subtitles.  I had almost no clue what was going on, and didn't really care after a while.  I can usually watch almost anything, most movies have some redeeming quality - for example, maybe an exotic, interesting locale.  This is largely set in New Mexico.  No offense to New Mexicans, but skip this.  I threw it away 
 Ms.Turner needs to cut down on her caffene. What starts out as a promising book on day trading quickly devolves into an infantile screaming and bragging session. She peppers practically every sentence with an exclamation mark as if all her words had world shattering implications. Sorry Tony, the only shattering you have done is with our patience. The book is filled with self-promotion and boasting and this wears thin quickly. She is not so much a sucessful day trader as much as a person who knows how to sell books. While her hyper style of teaching may work in a conference setting, it goes over as crude and condesending in print. She is not the end all be all of begining day trading instruction books, as she would like to think, but only a small pebble on the beach of hundreds of get rich quick scheme books. It is unfortunate that I was duped into buying this book by the reviews written here. Don't be suckered, avoid this book and buy one that is more professional and easy to understand 
 i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here. but when i actually used for a few days, i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day. it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter. i would not recommend this to anyone 
 The story goes beyond bad. This is a story of three little girls that torture and kill the wolf in a premeditated way. My 4 year-old son was very sad after someone read the story to him in a school interview to preschool. He said to me that it was a bad story, and the girls have done "bad choices". I can't believe this is in the list of books recommended for 4 and 5's.  
 I found this book to be lacking.  In character development, plot, etc.  It just never really went anywhere - not that it needed to but it just didn't grab me as her other novels have.  I found it to be very underdeveloped.  Perhaps, as one other reviewer wrote, this was before she hit her stride?  That's what I think 
 Yes, there are sometimes personality changes in heart transplant patients.  The surgury can result in hypoxia or small strokes that damage the brain causing personality change.  Multiple sources of information overwhelmingly  demonstrate that the brain is the seat of emotion as well as reason.   Claiming that memory and emotion reside in the heart obscures the useful  message - the message that we would do well to slow down and pay better  attention to our bodily feelings and our emotions 
 It looks  like the marketing boys that control the motogp organization  were looking for a way to make some extra money for the coming 2007 season and the start of 800cc premiere class by dreaming up this silly  excuse of a dvd, the racing footage was mediorce and the context of the rivalry insipid. Nice seeing the two-stroke 500cc bikes 
 AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.  	If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"   	At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.  	Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane 
 I'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. But I'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. "most ionic and infrared" is gibberish. Tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. I'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam 
 Yeah this is not a biased approach at all!! My eyes are rolling up in my head from the massive quantity of sarcasm....  This is not a good approach at all.....  Money is a valuable thing... don't waste it on this book.  
 Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard, Alchemies of Distance (Subpress, 2001)  I am sure there are readers out there who squeal with delight every time they pick up a book, open it, and find "America" spelled with a k. Well, folks, flock to this book, because you'll find it in abundance here. Keep the question in the back of your mind, though, why a poet-- someone who understands and communicates primarily through the written word, would feel that willful misspellings are both warranted to get across the message, and more important than communicating in such a way as to reach the greatest number of readers with the greatest understanding possible.  Ms. Sinavaiana-Gabbard's critiques of modern American culture are more than apparent without the willful misspelling. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone who reads this book and doesn't get the point. That, ultimately, is its biggest problem-- as with so many below-average books of so-called poetry, the message so often overrides the medium that the book becomes not poetry, but political screed broken up into short lines to make it look artistic. This is nothing new, and it's not overly shocking. What makes it all the more depressing in this case is twofold. First, Ms. Sinavaiana-Gabbard's introduction to the poems makes it obvious that she is exceptionally well-read in many different schools of poetry, and the lines she has chosen to quote from others to reflect different settings and feelings that drove her to write these poems makes it equally clear that her ear for poetry is far better than the voice she displays here; she knows how to recognize a great poem when someone else writes one, but falls very short in her own efforts time after time after time. The second thing is that when the hammer does hit the nail on the head, it drives it through the two by four and out the other side. Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard has written some astounding material here. For the most part, the images are washed away, quickly to be forgotten, by the political ranting, falling here and there in the screed like gold nuggets in the Colorado River. But the book's very last poem, "Pilgrimage," a haiku cycle, is like panning for those nuggets and suddenly discovering a solid-gold cast of Shelley's famous statue of Ozymandias. It's as close to perfect as some poets will ever get, closer than most. It is precise, observant, and profound, and it is a shining example of what this poet can do when she sets her mind to writing poetry. Worse, there's obviously a political message to be had from the poem, and like all great poems, "Pilgrimage" allows the images to speak, and lets the reader glean what's between the lines for himself.  Given "Pilgrimage," the rest of the book looks that much shabbier. Better to have left it out altogether and present a less-than-mediocre collection than to put it in and show what could have been. *  
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 I was really disappointed with this book. I did not like the illustrations or story line. My son never had an interest in this one either. With so many great other choices for pop up books, I would recommend thye Chuck Murphy pop up series, those really held my son's interest 
 It's sad that when a point of view or politcal party becomes more important than reality.  This book is just conjecture and wishful thinking.  Nothing more than bait and switch pulp.  It's too bad politcal thought and discourse have devolved in to nothing more than picking a team.  Our country deserves better.  Good work Podhoretz! Satan has seen your work and he likes what he sees!  You'll have plenty of time go over it with him when you burn in Hell for eternity.  Hey Christians, thou shalt not bear false witness counts for you, too!  Who says the lunatic fringe are the only one's who can pass judgement 
 if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.  liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.  sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.  repeat for 300 pages...   "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it 
 not nearly as appealing as the other magazines I have read: motortrend, car and driver, automobile mag, sport compact.  I don't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars.  Car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny 
 1. The persective of most writers is shaped by their own experience. Dr.Steele is an American Black, a baby boomer, a member of the academic elite, a liberal arts major, and a political "conservative".This certainly affects his perpective when he discusses social issues.  2. I felt that he was on pretty solid ground and made some good points when he was telling about his own experiences growing up in a segregated America and during the civil rights movement. His take on the psychological hangover after the 1964 passage of Civil Rights legislation regarding the attempts by the white power structure to regain "moral authority" by doing GOOD....and the black power advocates ready acceptance of those attempts... helps explain some of the dysfunctional after- effects that are still with us.   3. Where I disagree with his analysis - speaking from my own experience and perspective of course - is that he takes the race issue which he says has been pretty well settled in the US and then blows it all out of proportion by saying that white guilt is the underlying cause of nearly every difficult social issue in the last 50 years! And he blames the "dissociating liberals" (whoever they are) for attempting to deal with these social issues. Excuse me, but I recall Nixon and the Reaganites being in power for awhile and the Bush dynasty is still with us and I haven't seen a lot of effort being done to get-together and fix things for average folks here in the good ole US of A. Of course pressing the GUILT button in this mainly Judeo-Christian culture is a sure fire way to get everyones attention.  4. My point is that by injecting  blatant partisanship into the discourse he took a premise that people of all persuasions might coalesce around and instead divides us even further.His statement about Red and Blue States was a hoot! How is this helpful? Where are his suggestions for improvement - other than that he thinks Bush & Co. now have the "moral authority" that has been so lacking in America? Some might be inclined to disagree.  5. Finally, as a black Dr. Steele misreads me as a white liberal in that I have never felt guilty about my white heritage - only ashamed for the historically extremely dysfunctional behavior of many of our fellow humans - themselves victims of misbegotten religious dogma.If we stop trying to improve our world just because we make mistakes in the process.........and if we fail to learn the lessons of the past,we will be condemned to repeat them or be blown into outer space.Not a happy prospect for this social progressive and fiscal conservative. 
 This book is a bit too professional for anyone who is just starting an astrophysics course.......the provided questions really screw up ur brain.....but if ur sure u have a good solid pure math and advanced physics background  then go ahead and buy it otherwise check out other books.... 
 Although Eva Shaw is a good instructor in her teleclasses. This book is a waste of time.  Almost 3/4 of it is lined blank pages. The exercises are also very unimaginative.  
 This book is a reasonably good discussion of the dynamics of organizational change.  But it does not do much that a really top-notch book on organizational behavior and development does.  The major advantage of being topically focused on education -- the ability to focus on the mission of education -- is pretty much missed.  One of the common pitfalls of school systems is to become focused on the environment for the professionals to the point of insufficient attention to the group at the center of school system's mission -- the students.  Evans misses opportunities to integrate the theory and practice of organizational change with such core topics as curriculum, pedagogy, and the impact of theories -- either solidly research-based or faddish -- on the culture and outcomes in the classroo 
 There are many interesting tales in this book.  Few that have never been read before, but there is enough extra information included here to make them good for the second round.  The editing is poor, with a few errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar here and there.  The largest problem in this book, however is the attitude of the author.  The reader can clearly tell what he is stating as fiction or myth, and what he presumes to be fact.  He tells the story of the beginning of Earth (in his mind, the "Big Bang") as if he had been there.  His annoying, persistent use of words like "negroid" and referring to Native Americans as "Indians" are both unprofessional and offensive.  Over all, this pretentious bore should not be writing books on mysteries of the unknown, because he obviously thinks he knows everything 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I bought this book after reading the other reviews and checking out the author's website. I figured I could overlook his macho posturing, rambling style of writing (it takes him absolutely forever to make a point) and just take on board the suggestions he has. The guy seemed to have some real idea about sticky situations and I thought that this book would have good advice for getting out of trouble. Unfortunately this book does not deliver what it promises. For one thing, it is full of contradictions. For example:  1. Marc says that streetfighting is not like in the movies and he's not afraid to run to save his butt. That's fair enough. However, half of this book is made up of macho tales of Marc kicking butt on the streets (or in bars) and coming out without a scratch. It's kind of "Do what I say, not what I do."   2. He puts down traditional martial arts for having no practical use on the streets. Okay, that's a fair point in a lot of situations, but the techniques that he shows in this book aren't practical either. Most of what he shows is only good for taking down drunks. He talks about tripping your opponent over and not much more. In fact, for quite a few techniques suggested in this book you have to creep up behind your opponent. Heck, that's handy when defending yourself on the street. I can just imagine it - "Look behind you!" Oh no! He won't turn around. Now what?  3. One of the things that he critisises some martial art forms for is that they are reactionary - that is, you wait till your opponent has thrown a punch and then you deal with him (judo flips and so on). Then he starts the techniques in the book by pages of techniques that are totally based on avoiding a punch thrown at you before hitting the other guy. In other words, he does exactly what he says not to use martial arts to do.  4. He talks about doing everything simply, but the moves he teaches are really uneconomical in movement. They're big moves that take your whole body to do. So if you're looking for something that's easy for the other guy to spot, use the moves in this book.  5. He refers to other books he has put out for further explanations of techniques and other information. That would be okay if he said something like: "Here's move A. Here's move B. For moves C and D see my other books." But he doesn't. He says more like: "Here's half of move A. For the other half buy my other book." What good is that?  Now on to the good bits.   His basic observations about people's attitudes are accurate. In fact, most of what he says is spot-on. The only real problem I have is with the techniques. They are really just for bouncers, with a partner, who have to take down drunks. Actually, the title kind of says that, so it's my bad for thinking that there would be something that I could use to protect myself on the streets in here. There ain't.  Oh yeah, and his rambling tough-guy barroom boasting gets to me a bit. It wouldn't bother me so much, except that on the one hand he says that people who talk like that have no clue, and then he goes on to talk exactly like that. 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 I have decent respect for Amanda Marshall, and when her first album came out, it was not bad as far as pop albums go. Granted, it was only a pop album, and it was not stellar, but from that album I decided to investigate her music further as she put out more albums. Thus, I decided to grab up this latest attempt of hers to make pop music.  Well... it's pop music, that's for sure. It has a very weird mix of strings, hip-hop, and beats that I can't say that I dig on very much, myself. The combination of all of these elements seems rather awkward. Further investigation only seems to work against this album.  This album seems to have contorted Amanda Marshall's vocal career toward the current trend of pop sound. Her elegant voice on this album sounds much more manufactured, shallow, pale, machined, and extremely short in range. These are the kinds of qualities I expect in the pop singers like the current Britany Spears and Christina Aguilera as far as how they "reinvent" their sound. Amanda Marshall's vocal sound, in my opinion, takes a step backward because of this mixing/masking catastrophe.  Finally, one of the saddest things I find about this album are the lyrics. They aren't intelligent, snappy, or even strike me as anything other than juvenile/adolescent at best.  This album is not a very strong effort for this artist. Some rather odd/off-sounding elements coupled with an awfully invented mechanical sound that waters down her vocal potential with some equally weak lyrics does not make for a striking effort. It is different, but not all different is good, and I believe a listener would find more enjoyment from either her self-titled album or "Tuesday's Child" if you haven't been completely turned off with her from listening to this album. 
 One way or another, this film will leave you slack-jaw.  Everything about this film is so quintessentially bad that it should be taught in film school as an example of what not to do.  It's so terrible that the subject matter becomes irrelavant.  See it 
 There are a lot of negative reviews already, but if mine will deter just one person from reading this book, then adding my 2 cents is worth it. Yes, there are passages of beautiful description and some intriguing characters, but these are lost amid the hundreds of pages of worthless material. One gets the impression that Tartt was trying to write a portrait of Southern childhood that would rival To Kill a Mockingbird, and that might explain the "show-offy" verbosity of her prose. I started to suspect that she collected her favorite bits from writing exercises, journals, and abandoned short stories and threw them together hoping we'd be so impressed by her language we wouldn't notice the appalling lack of plot.  No, you do not find out who killed Robin, and I'm fine with open endings when they have a purpose, but this strikes me as sheer laziness 
 I just got and read this book because of some of the more recent and enthusiastic reader reviews. But I beg to differ with their assessment, since this is not the first book on the subject I have read. The author, a journalist, is over her head in this subject matter and apparently does not realize it. This becomes apparent in the context of other neuroscience literature.  Compared to serious works on the subject written by neuroscientists who actually do some of the research upon which their books are based, this is a quick read. I zipped through it in a few hours. By comparison, it takes me days to get through a work of the same length by Drs. LeDoux or Damasio, who are both absolute authorities. The quick overview can of course be most helpful, but be aware that the real scientists are harder to read for a reason. It's because they have very deep subject-matter knowledge coupled with fine sensitivity to what can be claimed without distortion. They know *all* of the pertinent studies on their topic, not just a small subset. They're cautious, and thorough in their explanations. The journalist tends to wish to make sweeping statements on the basis of insufficient knowledge, since she doesn't have years to master such a complex discipline and the summary style is more digestible for a broad audience. I am a scholar-researcher and academic journal editor myself, and have also done quite a bit of newspaper writing, so I know intimately both sides of the writing spectrum. In Ms. Carter's case, after not too many pages I began not to trust her pronouncements. Too many are simply too glib.  Carter treats too many aspects unevenly and incompletely. Music, for instance, gets only about two pages of text, over half of which is devoted to the tingle-thrill sensation, probably because the author found a catchy anecdote in an experiment about chickens and music. It's a cute story for a newspaper, but if you wish to understand music and the brain, this is not even a bare introduction. See instead any publication by Isabelle Peretz, a psychologist-neuroscientist specializing in music at the University of Montreal (she has lots of PDFs on her departmental website), who is very authoritative yet writes accessibly. Carter does not mention Peretz anywhere in the book.  I was surprised when Carter identified the amygdala as the "source of negative emotions of anger, fear and sadness" (p. 103). And she writes: "the amygdala, as we have seen, does not convey concepts, it simply creates emotional feelings." These are misleading formulations that you'd never read in anything written by Antonio Damasio. While it is strongly implicated in the fear reflex, I have not read elsewhere that the amygdala is so clearly involved in sadness or anger. And a neurologist would not say "creates emotional feelings" -- rather, it contributes to a piece of the process of feeling. In his books, Damasio is always careful to point out that any one small area of the brain is rarely completely responsible for anything. Rather, brain functions are typically distributed over networks of brain regions that work together in complex processes and pathways that are still mostly imperfectly understood. Damasio conscientiously presents his entire books as hypotheses in need of further research, whereas the journalist is not nearly so hesitant. The occupational hazard of every journalist is the impossible obligation to get up to speed on a new topic quickly, without any of the formal training that topic experts have, yet present a lucid and balanced explication to a wide readership. In this instance, as happens daily in the newspaper, the summary simplifies the story but often twists the facts and their implications.   On the plus side, the illustrations are numerous, pertinent, and quite helpful in assisting the reader to visualize many of the abstract and difficult concepts in this book. 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 The is a review of a pharmacy student. Unfortunately, this is a required text for my medchem/pharmacology class. You can ask any student in my class and majority of us would have the same complaint. This book is extremely difficult to follow. For example they give you a table for alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. While the table is more or less OK describing different beta receptor types, it doesn't tell much about alpha receptors. The authors of this omit a lot of important details.  They don't write much about medications' side effects. In general this book makes it difficult to distinguish medications of each group from each other. On the better side, the book provides a lot of chemical structures, which make medchem part easier 
 I used to think should never judge a book for the cover. But this time I was wrong. The book is plenty of average wedding photos. It's a sort of frustrating to try to be inspired by a book where the pictures are so standard, conservative and uncreative.  But the worst of all is that there is almost no direct relation between most of the pictures and the text. They are no real examples of what the text describes and there are only a few schemas for covering the topics explained.  I wanted a posing book but only a few chapters cover this area. For me 70% was un-useful information. Sometimes the author tries to teach you about depth of field or how to use a ladder and the possible complications you can having using it. If I wanted to read about lighting, well then I would buy a lighting book written by a master of lighting. For example, this guy don't know the existence of the big and expensive studio/fashion ring flashes and he adjudge the circular catch lights in fashion portraits to powerless macro ring flashes.  This book should be named: "The Wedding Portrait Photographer, a basic guide to photography".  I don't give this book one star because, yes!, there is still very useful posing information on it 
 Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.  This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.    Brian DeDentro (Rhode Island College 
 The author of this book is an ex English soccer player and sports commentator who had a nervous breakdown and went, well...nuts. He belives, for example, that the UK royal family are really lizards wearing disguises. Seriously, this is true..check it out. If you use this as a bench mark I think you can gauge how accurate his writings on 9/11 will be. This is not to say that there are not questions over 9/11, but this author is not going to cast any light on them. In the UK he is seen as just a nut and nobody really takes him seriously, so I dont think people across the pond should either. 
 i really like the aesthetic of this film, but not much else.  the dialogue in particular is really trite.  the characters are all hackneyed caricatures - john lurie as an unconvincing pimp, tom waits as a burnt-out DJ, and roberto benigni as a crazy italian guy.  i didn't believe these might be real people for one second - they are very clearly "characters".  the film is beautifully shot in black and white, but jarmusch leaves out a few things that would make this film more convincing.  waits and lurie meet in prison after each was set-up for different crimes, but the film never delves into why they were set-up.  we see very little of the prison aside from their cell.  we don't see the escape until they're in the tunnel.  we never see any police or dogs, we just hear them.  the coming together of nicoletta and roberta is ridiculous.    2 stars for the cinematography, 0 for everything else 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 28 Days Later begins when some foolish environmental activists/terrorists manage to unleash a plague of "Rage" upon England (and possibly the world).  The story then picks up 28 days later when a young man wakes up from a coma in his hospital bed that goes back to just prior to the outbreak.  As he, and by extension we, attempt to find out what's going on he wanders around London calling out "hello" repeatedly with no one answering.  While he ultimately manages to find other people as well as some infected unfortunates, it is striking how empty the entire city of London is.  Where did all those millions of people disappear to?  We never learn the answer to that question.  As the movie continues and we see the rest of England, we find it is similarly depopulated.  There are nowhere near enough corpses to believe everyone is dead and nowhere near enough infected to believe that everyone has turned.    I would gladly set aside an empty country if there were only something interesting happening in the movie to push it from my mind.  Sadly, the plot is almost nonexistent in this movie.  Very little actually happens.  Our small band of characters wander an empty UK and are very occasionally attacked but there is surprisingly little real menace.  When they finally find an organized band of military men, we find that man's inhumanity to man is alive and well as these "saviors" are arguably worse than the Rage infected maniacs.  This theme has been done in virtually every movie of this type since Dawn of the Dead and almost always in a far more interesting way.    The director of this film clearly has no idea how to build suspense, develop characters, or even shoot interesting action scenes.  I can't say that any aspect of this film was strong, or even mediocre, and would urge any and all people who haven't seen this yet to avoid it.  
 rec'd this pitchback and assembled, the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time. park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults.  very disappointed.  
 I'm not sure who was in charge of putting this dvd set together but I think they definately dropped the ball in the production of this season release.  You wouldn't ever see Law and Order or Seinfeld release a "Best of Season x" dvd leaving out certain less popular or less watched episodes.  I would have been perfectly happy paying a little more to get the rest of this dvd set.  On top of that, the Negreanu/Lindgren Esfandiari/Laak commentairies accompanying the season 2 dvd set were a highlight and I think they ought to have expanded that to all the episodes.   Overall, you get a dvd of 8 of the wpt episodes, half of the season, no commentary, no notable special features, and if you happened to be looking to replay your favorite episode you may be disappointed because the WPT didn't deem it on of the "Best" episodes.   I hope this is the first and final truly second class product issued form the WPT.  
 I saw this at the Toronto film festival over a year ago, and most of the audience was fighting to stay awake, even those who later published glowing reviews about it. Vital is terrible. I propped my eyelids open, because I really wanted it to be great, and was waiting in vain for Vital to redeem itself. I have seen every Tsukamoto film, and I love and own a copy of each of his works, except this one-- intentionally. I find his work amazing despite the arc of decline in quality, which defines his directing career. Vital is his current worst. Despite how boring it is (two hours of a confused, nearly mute Tadanobu Asano and scalpel scraping), some of the cinematography is beautiful. Be warned that this very similar to another terrible psycho-memory drama by David Cronenberg called "Spider." Vital could be considered the Japanese version of Spider, or Spider the Canadian-Irish version of Vital: Pretty pictures, a wisp of a story that is continually misremembered or confused, and main characters mumbling incoherently for two hours in primary colored rooms 
 When I read the book description on Amazon ("This atlas offers a balanced and comprehensive visual history of the age-old Arab-Israeli conflict") I had to laugh. First of all, for a "historical" book to describe the Arab-Israeli conflict as "age-old" is ludicrous, and I think, illustrates the kind of "historian" that Gilbert is (that is, not a very good one). This book is not comprehensive, and it is CERTAINLY not balanced. It's clearly Zionist in it's viewpoint and heavily skewed in its presentation 
 This book was not quite up to my expectations.  It was interesting but I felt the writer wasn't being totally honest about his rate of recovery since it conflicted heavily with his wife's view.  I actually liked his wifes diaries, they were very helpful in what the actual recovery process was.  I wouldn't highly recommend paying the money for this book 
 Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language.  I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs.  Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years.  Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one 
 My wife and I started reading to our daughter before she was born, and continue to read to her every day. She's four now, and her language skills are excellent. I am hopeful that continuing to read to her will help her grow. But it won't be with this crap. I cannot understand how child-like grammar, which is worse than the actual grammar used by my four year old daughter, can possibly be a positive influence. Moreover, the behavior of this character is exactly the behavior we are trying to help our daughter grow out of, so why would I encourage it by reading this? There are plenty of silly and fun books to be had, but the Junie B. Jones line is a disservice to children 
 Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst. I first started collecting Franklin biographies forty years ago, Van Doren, Fay, Issacson, Brands, Wood and a half a dozen others. At first glance, and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different... a new take that concentrated on France. Well it was new, and very different - it put me to sleep in my chair several times. I eventually gave up and shelved it with the others. What a shame. Boring.   
 mildly humorous, yet nearly completely devoid of useful information.  imaginative language: keep a dictionary on hand.  look here if seeking a few good laughs from a couple of witty fellas, dont if pursuing applicable advice 
 I have to agree with most of what's been said here.  I have two wonderful hand-reared black-tailed conures as pets - now this species is virtually unheard-of in captivity, so I bought this book on the strength of the 'detailed species descriptions' advertised.  What a slap in face!  Apparently my birds are simply 'similar to maroon-bellied conures, but ...not as interesting' (exact quotation).  The book is written from a breeder's point of view, and a breeder stuck two decades ago for that matter.  There is a strangely impersonal tone to the whole book, which some pet owners who don't see their birds as liquid assets may find off-putting.  I certainly did.  However, the many photos are good, which earns it the extra star 
 I am about to leave for basic training and i bought this book. this book taught me nothing new. it has basic concepts that any average joe would know. I was hoping to find new tips and tricks and found nothing like that.  Also, this is a self published book (produced by xilibris) which means that it cant even get picked up by a publisher. In other words, any average joe can right a book and get it printed, all you have to do is pay money for the book to get printed. If your about to go to basic training I would look elsewhere if you need a book to inform you of your future experience 
 Sorry, but I can't rate this book fairly as I still don't have it.  It's been almost 5 weeks since I ordered it, and I'm still waiting.  Several complaints, and I got a 5 dollar discount on my next order.  Why would I order anything else when I have to wait so long to get what I was promised in 2 weeks?  Next time I will buy at the local book store.  Yes, I will pay more but at least I will have the opportunity to read it before I die of old age 
 We are big Junie B Jones Fans!  Santa brought this T shirt this year.  It is unique as there is no other Junie B Clothing however...  It washes down to a small size 8, fades quite alot with the first washing and looks like a cheap little  boy's under shirt .    I was disappointed in the quality.     
 This book should only be sold as fiction and come with "Horse Whispers and Lies" attached.  Monty, shame on you...trying to take credit for inventing the slant load horse trailer, making claims to have been a Champion Calf Roper, and going to horse shows in a railroad box car?   His family says that it's all a bunch of lies.  The content of the book on horse handling is good, but Monty Roberts did not invent the methods used.  They have been around for years.   Monte, is a good horseman, he should not have made the preposterous, boastful statements that are included throughout the book. 
 No, you didn't. You read about 300 pages of gossip, slander and supposition. The font size is so big, when I first opened this book, I thought I had bought the "large print" version by mistake.  Yes, as many have noted, this book seems to "read fast" for a history book. But the number of words per page can also be used to guage the research and thought that Fleming put into his attack on "the New Dealers."  Any potential buyer might be advised to use the "look inside" feature to compare a page of this book with, for example, an excerpt from Robert Dallek's "Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy" or James MacGregor Burns' "Roosevelt: Soldier of Freedom." Eric Larabee's "Commander in Chief" is even more packed with information 
 I truly wish I had not read this book. I used to love "Mike and Mike in the Morning," but my view of Greenberg has been so damaged by this superficial, shallow, clueless piece of garbage that I have found myself unable to stomach listening to him anymore.  Greenberg obviously plays up the apparently oxymoronic "metrosexual sportscaster" angle, setting a defensive tone early regarding his abilities to discuss sports despite having fabulous taste in clothing, travel, and fine dining. Fine, this is a play on his on-air persona, no problem.  But when he tries to become "everyman," Greenberg demonstrates that he is as out of touch with the common populace as the athletes he covers are (or as Paris Hilton is, hence the title of this review). This is also why his Seinfeldian approach fails: Seinfeld found the common irritants we all face, whereas Greenberg complains that his wife left him alone for a week to raise his children...with their nanny. Excuse me? Are we supposed to chuckle knowingly that he now has to parent two small children with professional assistance? Sorry Greenberg, most of us would actually be single parents in that situation, not pretending. Similarly, he tells a "funny story" about his son's first word being a curse, but it is set up by sharing that this happened in Aspen, in a chalet with cathedral ceilings and chandeliers ("How do they change the lightbulbs in those things" he wonders increduously, as we all do when vacationing in Aspen in gorgeous chalets). Oh, and what used to be six people is now "three couples, three nannies, and seven children." This kind of unnecessary, extraneous detail--which is prevalent throughout the book--reinforces how different he is from me, how unrelatable his experiences are to mine, and breaks any sense of community that good writers are able to develop. For example, he also repeatedly discusses his neighbors--billionaires who throw lavish parties, give him cases of his favorite Vodka, and fly him to Florida in a private jet. Greenberg shares that, if given the option, there is no better way to fly than on a private jet. Thanks for the tip, Greeny, I'll get right on that.  Coupled with his repeated references to $100 ties, Prada backpacks, and expensive clothing, Greenberg comes off as an arrogant, superficial, spoiled little rich brat. His obvious lack of appreciation for what he has, coupled with his assumption that he has anything of relevance to teach a larger audience about parenting ("You cannot get snot off a cashmere sweater" as but one example), makes me view him as completely undeserving of his success and not wanting to contribute to it in anyway. You think your life is hard because your daughter threw up on the tile floor in your spacious kitchen? Try wondering whether you'll have money to pay your bills next month. THAT'S stress.  The title of his book references his belief that ALL women think their husbands are idiots; it's his grand insight into relationships that I guess is supposed to convince us he is thoughtful and has some depth of character. Sorry Greenberg, most women I know--including my wife--have respect for their husbands. Your wife thinks you're an idiot because you are one.  Just like Paris Hilton. 
 Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look 
 I usually really love her books and this one was good but not great.  I think if the first 150 pages of "will she wont she" were not so repetitive it would be much more enjoyable. The characters of Kate and Mitchell were likeable and the story did get better as it went along.It was just way too fluffy for me and not a suspense at all.I also find the lifestyle of her characters so insanly unreal. Private jets, nannies,access to five million dollars in 2 hours, Money beyond imagination. Just too fluffy...... 
 Although Robin McKinley's stock heroine of "tall awkward ugly girl who loves horses and hates dresses" has worked well in other of her fairytale retellings*, this one is a distinct disappointment because it seems that that's all there is to Princess Briar-Rose. Even being the central character of the tale, she seems to have little personality other than the above attributes, which are emphasised to make sure the readers know Rosie would make an awful princess. Indeed, none of the characters in this book are particularly memorable, except perhaps Katriona who rescues baby Rosie as a teenage fairy agonising over her inability to do magic.  The plot is little better - events seem random and contrived, and the resolution to the problem of the missing princess is more than predictable by the time the reader reaches the second third of the book. Again, this is a let-down because other of McKinley's fantasy novels are well woven together.  One innovation that I did like about this book was "baby-magic" - a phase of uncontrolled, temperamental magic that fairies go through as toddlers - not relevant to the plot at any point, but an amusing distraction from its mediocrity. Note that fairies in this book aren't little people, but simply humans born with magical ability.  *Beauty, The Outlaws of Sherwood, Deerskin, etc 
 I read all the positive reviews, and after using this unit I can only say that those giving the Omega 8005 a positive rating must have either very low standards or nothing better with which to compare.  I have a Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite, arguably the pinnacle of consumer-level juicers. This thing is fast, easy to clean, and exceptionally well designed from a usability standpoint. The industrial design is tremendous, and everything is sized perfectly and makes sense.  The Omega 8005, unfortunately, doesn't compare. It's feed tube is so incredibly small that you can only feed a single stem of kale at a time, or risk jamming the tube. The Omega 8005 is absolutely useless to juice anything other than grass or simple greens because of its inability to handle a decent quantity at one time. Even the tray that sits atop the feed chute is shallow, narrow, and utterly useless because whatever you put into it quickly falls out.  It takes me a good 10-15 min. to juice two bunches of parsley and one bunch of kale, excluding clean-up, simply because you have to cautiously feed each item or risk a jam. The amount of juice produced is under 4 oz., enough green juice for one person. If I had to spend 10-15 min. juicing for each person (not including cleanup) in my household, that's a good 45 min. of juicing time plus cleanup.  Although the Breville isn't particularly adept at juicing leafy greens, it can produce 8 oz. of juice in under 10 seconds from items such as carrots, apples, oranges, pineapples, tomatoes, grapefruits, etc. Such items make absolutely no sense to juice in the Omega 8005 because it would take an inordinate amount of time to chop everything up into the small 1 inch squares that are required to fit through the feed chute.  When the feed chute jamps (quite often), the supplied plunger is inadequate to exert enough leverage to force the produce down the chute. When you do exert force, the entire juicer tips unless you use both hands -- one to force the produce down, the other to physically hold the juicer down.  Cleanup is a big chore. The Breville has large, easy parts to rinse, but the Omega 8005 has easily double the number of parts that require cleaning. The parts are smaller, with a lot more nooks and crannies requiring attention.  Photos of the Omega 8005 show a single container underneath the juicer to catch both juice and pulp, which is ridiculous. The container provided is not large enough to properly catch pulp, unless you enjoy having pulp all over your counter. Contrary to the representations made on the packaging and in the instructions, you need to use two containers: one for the juice and the other for the pulp. This machine contains a multitude of design flaws that are further exacerbated by undersized parts which inhibit usability and functionality.  It seems to produce slightly more juice from greens than the Breville, although not by a quantity significant enough to mitigate the amount of time and frustration spent in using this underpowered, undersized, and badly designed machine. Juice is very thick and pulpy, with small pepper-sized pieces of the original vegetable present in the juice. Very annoying, especially since none of this is an issue with the Breville.  You will read people claiming that juice from the Omega 8005 is healthier because it has less froth and is not subject to the "warming" of a centrifugal design, thereby retaining more of its nutrients. This could not be farther from the truth. The Omega 8005's single impellar produced plenty of heat from friction, and juice comes out substantially warmed from its cold refrigerator state. I have noticed no such warming in the Breville 800JEXL, and can't help but believe that users of the Omega 8005 once again are deluding themselves into believing marketing hype that simply isn't true (i.e., it's a big lie). As far as froth is concerned, yes, the Omega 8005 produces far less froth -- but at the expense of a pulpier juice with pepper-sized gritty fragments of vegetable in it. Given the choice, I'll take the cleaner juice with the froth and just skim off the froth.  I did not purchase from Amazon, but from another store that had a better price. I wish I had bought from Amazon, as I could probably return the thing now that I've discovered its many flaws. I can't imagine anybody using this to juice anything of any substance -- it would take just too darn long.  In short: don't buy this machine. Unless you specifically need to juice greens for the maximum amount of extraction and are willing to put up with a badly designed unit, pass this one up and go for the gold: the Breville 800JEXL. You won't regret it 
 The old timers like me back in the inner cities where Smokey and the Miracles orginally put their stake down in Motown and R&B royalty, used to call him Bill Smokey Robinson. Whenever I meet someone who recalls the days back in the early to mid sixties when the black transistor made in Japan radios were blaring down the New York City school hallways playing The Tracks of my Tears, Shop Around, OOO Baby Baby (which brings back memories of my first interacial slow dance in the Junior High School gym) and the Tears of a Clown, all selections being on The Ultimate Collection~Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, I know that my buddy remembers Smokey's spindly aura on the stage and his silky smoooth and relaxed delivery. I apologize to my readers for run on sentences but Smokey requires such detailed explanation as a legendary contributor to soul, R&B and the Motown wall of sound (they had one too) that my effusive and continuing acclamation of this cherished and enormously loved performer is understated. I heard that Smokey recently brought his performance to Flint, Michigan or maybe some other backyard town in auto country. I really wish that I could have been there to see Smokey put out before a hometown crowd. That must have been nothing short of a miracle. I am going to hit the click button now myself, I need to hear again the sounds that captivated all of us when we walked down the hallways in Junior High with the made in Japans, fingerpopping all the way. Please note, I meant to push 5 stars on this CD and cannot figure out how to correct the above. I apoligize for any misunderstanding however everybody who has ever been touched by Smokey's music probably realized this faux pas.  Jay Adler,    Massapequa, New Yor 
 I'm a fairly novice cook, but I can follow a recipe as well as anyone, and I've had excellent results from other cookbooks.  I just CANNOT get anything from this cookbook to taste good, and after patiently trying several different recipes (some multiple times), I have completely given up on it.  My best results were passable; the worst were inedible.  The yogurt marinade for the "Tandoori Chicken" was absolutely atrocious, and tasted nothing like real Indian food.  Cooking times are consistently off -- if Bittman tells you that your chicken will be cooked through in 5 minutes, expect it to still be raw after 10.  Furthermore, the recipes may be "simple" in the sense of having few ingredients and short cooking times, but they are not at all durable.  Give your dish a bit too much time or heat (even if it's what the recipe calls for!) and you end up with an inedible hunk of leather.  Tonight was my final attempt.  Cook minced onions on high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally?  Mine were carbonized in 3 minutes, and I just gave up and called in for pizza.  If you have plenty of cooking experience, and can improvise successfully around a recipe that's simply a rough outline -- rather than, well, a recipe -- then you may get decent results from this book.  However, if you're the type of cook who expects to follow a recipe to the letter and get good food, then stay away from this book 
 I absolutely loved two of Lisa See's other novels: "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" and "Dragon Bones" and recommend both of them highly - she is an incredibly talented writer.   That being said, I had very high hopes for this book but was disappointed. The one-hundred year odyssey of her family is indeed fascinating and the amount of research she did is evident. The emotional journey she must have encountered while writing the story is palpable. As with the above-mentioned novels, you feel like you know her characters and get such a sense of their surroundings- the sights, smells, and tastes of their lives. On the flip side, however, this novel was just too packed with details. It felt like she tried to cram everything in. Certain chapters certainly could have been cut out entirely from the story and it would have had the same meaning and effect.   It should have focused more on Fong See and his life as opposed to then focusing on his childrens' lives and going on and on from there. His story is undeniably both interesting and troubling- it depicts "American" prejudice, racism and the difficulties facing minorities in this country.  However, it would have been more poingnant if it stood alone as the focal point of the novel.    
 I bought this CD not long after it came out.  It didn't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it!!!  I like Somehow Our Love Survives and Abandoned Garden.  Other than that this is a mediocre effort for Michael. He has used this kind of Brazilian theme on Sleeping Gypsy already. Stick with your roots Michael...you are from California...not South America. Try buying Blue Pacific instead!!! I abandoned this one a long time ago 
 This band has the most retarded lyrics I've ever heard - "Sometimes the sun goes down, sometimes it goes back up, I'm wondering which one you are watching now."  Huh??  Forget about the singer's gross melodramatic voice or the band's boring decision to steal riffs from the Strokes - just check out those lyrics!!  The sun doesn't 'sometimes' go up and down, it ALWAYS goes up and down - ALWAYS - you morons.  "I'm wondering which one you are watching now."  Which one?  Excuse me, last time I checked, we have only ONE sun, not two.  Whatever.  Maybe these hipsters should've spent more time in school and less time working on their hair.  Their first record was trying to sound like Weezer and now they're trying to sound like Hot Hot Heat.  How lame is that?  And why are these guys trying so hard to look like the Strokes?  They even have that token dude with the caucasion 'fro.  I was suckered into seeing these guys at Spaceland last month and overheard the singer "pep-talking" his band.  So embarassing. "Okay, guys, have fun tonight but make it look natural.  You never know who might be in the audience.  And don't forget, those fat girls in the front row bought some merch so pretend to be nice to them and we'll make fun of them later."  Cool guys.  
 Daniel Dennett's excellent book Consciousness Explained extracts a very funny cartoon from Scientific American, in which two professors stare at a blackboard showing a formula full of complex algebra. In the middle of the formula appears the sentence, "THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS". One professor points to the statement and says to the other, "I think you should be more explicit here in step two."  Roger Penrose isn't just any old boffin: he is the Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University and has been knighted for his services to Science. The Emperor's New Mind is his attempt to crack that perennial philosophical chestnut, the Consciousness/Artificial Intelligence problem. Penrose's view is that Strong AI is simply wrong and that a computer could never replicate (functionally or actually) what we know as "consciousness".  Right. Take a deep breath here. For it's a scary thing for a mere mortal (with a decidedly ordinary bachelor's degree in the humanities) to say something like this about the one of the cleverest men on the planet, but I can't see any way around it: In this book Roger Penrose completely, totally, misses the point. Insofar as it's considered an entry on the Consciousness/AI debate, The Emperor's New Mind - all 583 pages of it - is all but worthless.  There. I said it.   Then again, nearly 500 of those pages don't even purport to be about consciousness, so perhaps all is not lost. Instead, they contain an extremely dense, at times fascinating, but uniformly (and I use the word deliberately) dazzling overview of the more esoteric parts of modern mathematics, physics and cosmology. While Penrose thinks it is necessary background, it isn't - it amounts to an extremely long winded appeal to authority:  One is left with the firm impression that the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University is a very, very smart chap, and that one really ought to see that what ever he says goes. This is no small irony, given the title of his book. For if anyone is holding himself out as being a tailor purveying a cloth that only the cleverest people can see, it's Roger Penrose.  Here's where I think he goes wrong. Firstly, his attempt to undermine the AI position is founded on purely mathematical reasoning. Pure mathematics is a closed logical system. Its truths aren't falsifiable, so by themselves have no explanatory force. Mathematical statements (such as "1+1=2") are necessarily true for all time and all universes so, ipso facto, they can't - by themselves - tell us anything about any particular universe. Yet that is just what Penrose asks them to do. He invokes Gödel's theorem of undecidability, perhaps to counter the argument I have just made, but it isn't convincing - being logically unable to prove all truths in a particular set (even though you know they are true) is very different from being able to falsify them. Without that power, you have no explanatory traction in the outside world.  Penrose's entire attack on Strong AI is based on an unfalsifiable, and therefore non-content carrying, argument.  Another error is to assume an algorithm must have been designed for the purpose for which it is used, and must work perfectly to be of any use. Natural selection illustrates that this is simply not the case. An algorithm may have a number of useful unintended by-products, and an algorithm can be extremely useful even when we know it to be completely misconceived at every level: take Newtonian mechanics as a good example. We've known for a century it isn't correct but in most practical circumstances it works fine.   Which brings me to my next point: for all the learning Penrose includes on Mandelbrot sets, phase space, entropy and Hawking Radiation, The Emperor's New Mind is conspicuous for what it leaves out: The bibliography contains no reference to Karl Popper nor the general philosophy of science - which might have helped him on the issue of falsifiability - nor crucially to a number of writers who have been very influential on the modern mind/AI question: Daniel Dennett is barely mentioned (Dennett's writing probably represents the "forefront" of the consciousness debate), nor is Richard Dawkins well-referenced, despite having written compellingly (and, being a zoologist, with a great deal more expertise) on the question of algorithms in natural selection. Indeed, Penrose doesn't clearly present the arguments of any particular supporter of strong AI, but rather chooses to generalise loosely as if he is convinced his mathematical deductions can carry the day, and that AI doesn't present a significant challenge. Douglas Hofstadter is given a little space, and John Searle and his largely discredited Chinese Room Experiment a fair space, but other than that the only philosopher Penrose seems to be aware of is Plato.  Another thinker Penrose doesn't seem familiar with is William of Occam. Instead of doing some background reading (and applying a little common sense), Penrose has launched a theory which (as he proudly proclaims) takes us to the ends of time and the universe and back to the smallest subatomic particles to explain (in ways he freely admits he doesn't understand) an everyday, prosaic (but still extremely hard to grasp) phenomenon. In its interstellar journey Penrose's theory drifts very close to dualism, and close (but not quite so close, perhaps) to positing (or needing) some sort of God to work. That will give succour in some quarters, but not the ones Penrose has in mind, I suspect.   Occam's Razor would require that such untestable and speculative suppositions be rejected unless no other explanation is available. Penrose would protest there are none; Dennett, Dawkins, Hofstadter and their colleagues and adherents (including me) would beg to differ, and point to a lot of literature that Penrose hasn't read. In any case one would think that Penrose's own intuition (which he claims helps him to see truth despite Gödel undecidability!) ought to help him see his theory is, as Jeremy Bentham would say, "nonsense on stilts".   Ultimately, when Penrose says "quantum theory explains consciousness" he is really saying no more than "something magic happens!" or even "THEN A MIRACLE OCCURS".  Mr Penrose, I think you should be more explicit here in step two.  Olly Buxton 
 The music is good but the sound is kind of muddy and hard to hear.  Whoever did the remastering needs to work harder. I guess you get what you pay for 
 I *LOVED* all of Jennifer Weiner's previous books.  As soon as I saw she had a new one out, I ordered it.  It was terrible.  A bunch of short stories, that have no beginning, middle or ending.  It was like a bunch of dis-jointed thoughts that went nowhere, and then a new "story", that was just as bad.  This book was like picking up 10 books off your bookshelf and reading a random chapter in each one.  Save your money 
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 I found this book to be far too shallow to be of any great use. While it does gives an overall picture of the situation, much of the contents lack depth that neither practitioner nor student would find it to be of much help when dealing with real life problems. Not recommended 
 The book does not give any practical view on the subject. The theories are vaguely narrated but not explained. Overall structure totally misses the point of teaching - the concepts and methodoligies are used within the text and elaborated later. Sections explaining various mathemathical models I consider being incomprehensible 
 Caution: This review contains a couple spoilers!  First off, I have to admit that my husband and I ended up seeing this by accident, when flipping through channels. What is not accidental (and is patently inexcusable, in my opinion) is the sheer awfulness of this movie. It was so bad it was funny, and for that reason alone we watched it for the (surely unintended) comedy.    The movie is rife with stock and unoriginal characters: whiny useless blonde woman, who can only stand there and scream at critical junctures (almost as vexing as those young women in horror flicks who are running for their lives but always trip and/or fall down), sexy young doctor/bimbo character (I guess she finished that pesky PhD while still in high school), buff blonde himbo (no, that's not a typo, he's just the male surfer version of the bimbo), and a couple of token minorities, one of whom gives preachy pep talks (we actually cheered when in the midst of Jackson's character's "we must pull together as a team to survive" rah-rah speech, a shark surfaced and gulped him down raw). Yummy. Mr. Shark doesn't fancy that sanctimonious claptrap anymore than we did.  Most amusing scene: bimbo scientist feels it necessary to strip off her wetsuit before she kills a shark, and after all the drama and suspense of the impromptu strip-tease we see she's wearing sensible white undies rather than Victoria's Secret. Aww, what a disappointment. But I guess good girls don't go to heaven if they wear naughty underwear.   More things we picked up on: whenever a character cusses, drinks, smokes, or looks at porn, something terrible happens. Evil shark suddenly appears and punishes said sinner. Hardly subtle. (For example, one guy lights up a cigarette and seconds later loses a hand - hubby said this was the best anti-smoking campaign ad ever!) There are probably more than a dozen references to God throughout this film, which in itself is not objectionable, but becomes obvious and annoying after more than a couple times. There's even a "group hug" scene where all the characters join hands in a circle and pray. What is this, the 700 Club? Not to mention a shark gets stabbed with a crucifix in the end. Spare us the lofty moral overtones and get on with the story already. Oh wait, that would require a plot, wouldn't it?    A lot of people have been comparing this movie to "Jaws." I'm not sure what they've been smoking (careful there, might lose a hand!;), but the only thing this joke of a film has in common with "Jaws" is the CGI effects might as well date from the 70s. There's no excuse for a 1999 film to have CGI so terribly bad that it's just plain embarrassing after awhile. Cast should have done shadow-puppets on a wall instead - I think it would have been scarier. More entertaining, too.  This movie is so predictable, so corny, and so appallingly bad that I wonder if the actors even dare list it on their resumes. 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 "Rachel and Her Children" is an award-winning compilation of the author's conversations with homeless people, highlighting how the downtrodden suffer in the United States at the end of the 20th Century.  Jonathan Kozol pulls no punches in his one-sided indictment of the American way, putting the blame for homelessness squarely on the shoulders of everyone else (Americans with homes, that is, the rest of us).  Although much of what Kozol depicts is heart-rending, I would have welcomed a more balanced presentation of the homeless issue, not only discussing the shortcomings of a political and economic system that makes it difficult for the homeless to overcome their situation, but also indicating that the homeless bear a good deal of personal repsonsibility in their plight (making little to no effort to seek employment, avoiding or sometimes even refusing to accept the albeit limited help offered by government agencies, sinking further into poverty by irresponsibly having children whom they cannot afford to support, etc).  For those of you who want a stronger kick in the pants about the suffering of the poor than that provided by Jonathan Kozol, I suggest reading the essay of another Jonathan (Swift's "A Modest Proposal") 
 After playing this game for the third time I had a thought, 'WHY DID I BUY THIS!' This game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly. I cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other NBA Street's. Save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game 
 The author divides the books into sections by elements--good enough for organization of material.  She provides lists of correspondences.  Fine, could be useful.  What it does not do is provide any real information.  We get a lot of watered-down fantasy novel-style "vision quests" or "seekings," encounters the author alleges to have experienced.  These "experiences" form the bulk (and I do mean bulk) of the book.  Apparently, one is supposed to envision one's self in the author's role.  There is no explanation given for the structure of these pathworkings (the kindest thing I can call them), which are interspersed with commentary about the author's "Native American family."  (She claims to have been adopted into a Native American clan.)  She makes many references to possible Native American teachings, but offers no source material, how to seek out further information about topics she urges readers to explore more fully.  The terminology she uses is just authentic-enough to sound legitimate, but so vague they reveal nothing.  (An example:  the examination of a crystal the author has on a staff.  A tribal elder who is apparently one of her teachers examines it and gravely announces it used to be a Grandfather crystal.  So what, exactly, is a Grandfather crystal, and why is it mounted in a Wiccan-style staff?  With runes, no less.)  Even more suspiciously, many of her "Native American teachings" sound like something out of a Hollywood script than anything one might imagine being part of an actual oral tribal tradition, passed down from shaman to student.  Lastly, there are pages and pages of meaningless diagrams and a list of colored "rays" that will bring all kinds of good things into one's life if one meditates on them.  The entire book reads like a Wiccan primer with a glaze of pseudo-Native American spirituality as seen by Caucasians.  I have read other books on shamanism, and many stress their adoptive connections to the parent culture.  (A good experience for them if it actually happened, but one can hardly expect readersto stampede over and demand adoption.)  And yet this information, supposedly kept within these families and tribes for centuries, is now being set out in print for the mass consumption of the reading public.  Well, what was the point of being 'adopted'?  If these 'adoptive families' wanted this information public, wouldn't they have written a book themselves?  Some of the more honest books on shamanism admit they are witholding certain information because some knowledge *should* be kept 'in the family'.  They openly say they are creating something for use by people living in the modern age.  Wolfe has done none of this. Waste of time to read.  Waste of space on my bookshelf.  Waste of trees to print it.  Waste of *plastic* for the bag I carried it home in.  I'd be embarrassed to even turn this thing to a used bookstore for credit. 
 I was surprised to see how small this book was - I should have read the fine print! It worked out to around 70 pages, I think. The book is apparently drawn from the author's introduction-to-handguns classroom curriculum and is very light on content. The most informative handgun book I found by far was "The Concealed Handgun Manual" by Chris Bird 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Be cautious when buying this book.  There is a printing problem that results in the loss of dots.  That means periods, primes, decimals, the dot on a semicolon, etc.  Not all are missing, but this is a mathematics book.  This is utterly inexcusable and the publisher should never have distributed a book in this condition.  Basic proof reading would have caught the error when converting from old technology to new.   My professor says the hardback doesn't have the same problem.  (I'm in the market if you've got one.)  I returned my copy to the bookstore for a refund 
 I didn't like the book. It doesn't have much to do with consulting. It is teaching about how to sell, how to register a company and similar pretty common stuff. The book is missing the consulting essentials - some tools, how to build and defend a workshop, some blueprint examples for different situations, approaches to strategic and "tactical" consulting respectively... In the same time it is handling some micro processes on a "how to give a smile" level and giving some advices as "you should have a web site". Wow. I just didn't find the value 
 Many points/ideas are common sense. Many points/ideas are repeated in multiple chapters. It just uses too many words on simple topics. This 550-page book can be easily rewritten in less than 100 pages 
 A poor attempt at horror. The "scary" scenes seemed reminiscent of a 1970's made for TV movie. The storyline was very simple, no depth, no surprises. How or why did Nicholson and Pfeiffer get involved in this? The ending added up to a big nothing. Rick Baker, supreme make-up artist...looks like he just glued on some sideburns and dracula teeth. Even the Ennio Morricone soundtrack sounded like elevator music. If they left out the horror, and just focused on the young overambitious Spader squareing off against Nicholson in a high-level executive cutthroat job position fight, it would have been entertaining 
 Gee - sorry to those who like this modern recording but I like the 1951 recording the best.I have both the LP which is quite scratched by now and the CD which is quite good except for the pauses between tracks. I recommend the 1951 version available from Amazon (or at least it was in 2001) 
 If you're a fan of Mineo's and you're looking to add another piece of material to a media collection, buy this book and keep it on a shelf somewhere.  If you would prefer to gain some insight into a complicated life, move on.  This is the kind of biography I abhor:  its content is almost entirely derived from fan magazines, press releases and newspaper clippings.  To make matters even worse, it attempts to pass itself off as a serious work when it should be mass paperback sized and sold alongside the Jonbenet Ramsey and Scott Peterson quickie books at the supermarket.  Peppered throughout the book is superfluous information that appears to have no value aside from increasing the page count(for instance, an entire page is devoted to listing the contents of the theatre owners press book for "Crime in the Streets.")  So many people who were a part of Mineo's personal and professional life are alive and the author appears not to have contacted any of them, conducted one interview or gathered any new material whatsoever.  What makes that even more frustrating is that the author was acquainted with Mineo during the last several years of his life and alludes that writing this book was a mission he needed to undertake. Unfortunately the inclusion of a few of his personal conversations with Mineo (some having to do with Mineo's rather convenient wish that the author write his Bio) are no substitute for a well researched biography and the insights of an expert.  If you'd like to read a fascinating book on a somewhat similar person, find a copy of Charles Winecoff's "Split Image: The Life of Anthony Perkins.&quot 
 Hi, I have all the 3 famous book of Kevyn Aucoin (Making Faces, Faces Forward and this) and this one is the worst. Why is this the most expensive? I don`t understand 
 it is nice to have tab, with the notation.   there is no indication as to which version of the tunes he is trancribing , the title is a lie  there is no breakdown of the guitar style there just tunes trincribed period 
 The Seven-Ups was producer-turned-director Philip D'Antoni's attempt to outdo his earlier Bullitt and The French Connection but it falls flat because of a lack of starpower and a story that just doesn't matter. If anything its more a premise than a plot - a cop is unaware that his main informer is actually using him to get information on which mobsters to kidnap - and has characterization that never rises to the level of paper thin: despite a few "just a coupla kids from the old neighborhood" lines, the characters simply aren't there, leaving Roy Scheider often seeming on the verge of being completely lost while Tony Lo Bianco's hesitancy all too often seems more like desperation for something to latch on to. The car chase is good but not that good in a film that doesn't have enough going for it for that to be enough and which sorely lacks fizz.  Fox's DVD isn't a bad package - widescreen 1.85:1 and fullscreen transfers, teaser and full trailer and a vintage short on the shooting of the car chase 
 Sandra Brown is my favorite suspense/romance writer.  I always look forward to reading her new releases and this book was no exception.  However, I was very disappointed with Ricochet.  Normally, her books have so many twists and turns that you can't figure out "who did it" until the very end, which keeps you up all night wanting to read.  This book was different.  I kept thinking it would get better but it never did.  I highly recommend Chill Factor or White Hot instead of Ricochet 
 This book was a disappointment.  It was full of platitudes and emotional and attitudinal characteristics recommended for mortgage brokers.  But it had no real techniques, no strategy.  It advocated a shotgun approach to marketing; do everything, signs, websites, telemarketing, advertising, etc.  Save your money 
 Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in "Stairway To Heaven". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!! 
 Before I saw this movie I was warned that is was anti-Christian and that the writers of the screenplay didn't have a clue as to what following Christ is really all about.  After seeing the movie I am convinced of the latter but only somewhat of the former.   Mandy Moore does a great job playing a legalistic, "church-lady" type named Hilary,  who goes beyond "witnessing" in her attempts at converting others by using crisis intervention tactics--like blocking the hallways with her and her friends, or attempting to kidnap the subject and throwing him/her into their van for treatment.  For Hilary, Christianity is all about behavior modification.  She lacks heart winds up with bitterness.  Her only hope at the end comes from her wheelchair bound brother, a nonbeliever, who offers to help her with her problems.  One can only assume that rather than correcting her misperceptions of Jesus, he will instead try to deprogram her of her faith.   Hilary's nemesis, who she constantly tries to convert, is Cassandra, played by Eva Amurri.  Cassandra, a Jewish girl determined not to convert, brings to mind Matthew 13:19.  She has heard the Word and "understandeth it not" as a person who received the "seed" by the wayside.  She becomes a hero in the end for having a big heart, though she still chooses the earthly path rather than the spiritual one, thinking she only needs to rely on herself.   Mary, played wonderfully by Jena Malone for her innocence, seems to turn against God a bit too easily when in trouble (see Matthew 13:21).  Blaming God when it was she who forgot to bring protection along seems very shortsighted for a girl with such strong willed faith.  But many young Christians do feel persecuted when they don't get what they pray for, a sign of spiritual immaturity.   The problem with this movie is that no one has spiritual maturity, including the writers of the screenplay.  Even the most sinful pastor will answer "YES" when asked by a young gay teenager, banned from prom night, if Jesus still loves him.  This one doesn't know what to say.  There are no answers given to the audience of this film, most of whom are young people looking for answers.  So I will give a short one here.   Saint Augustine said something that at first sounds irresponsible when not fully understood.  He said "Love God, and then do as you please."  What he meant is that when we really love Jesus intensely for who He is and what he sacrificed for us, our hearts will change.  Sinful behavior we used to commit no longer has the same appeal to us as before.  Being obedient to God brings us pleasure when we have true love and devotion to Christ.  We are still sinners but no longer by desire--not perfect but forgiven.  Would it have been so difficult to include just one character at a Christian school who mentions this?  The difficulty lies in finding screenwriters in Hollywood who have a clue about it.  Don't get me wrong.  All of the characters in this movie were essential!  But they forgot the most essential of all 
 This book is AWFUL.  If you are trying to learn Sanskrit grammar as a beginner or just interested in getting some basics, this is NOT the book for you.  This book would be great as a reference material if you understood complex grammar terms such as another reviewer mentioned.  The books is entirely too dense, the index to look things up is awful.  All and all I would NOT recommend this.  Please stay away from it unless you are holding your Master's in Linguistics or already have an EXTREMELY THOROUGH knowledge of Sanskrit language and grammar.  Very disappointing book indeed 
 I would like to get more information about bussines planning especially  quality management including human resources business planning in the last  decade 
 This book takes an interesting topic like functional programming and makes it hideously boring.  In retrospect, I wish I'd bought Hudak's book instead.  I read a review claiming that Mr. Thompson's book was better for newcomers to Haskell than Mr. Hudak's.  I don't know where this idea came from; I later borrowed Hudak's "Haskell School of Expression" and found it to be more informative and faster-paced than this book.  I give it two stars only because it is useful as a reference.  If you're looking to learn Haskell and do cool things with it, get School of Expression instead 
 Yes, I am addicted to Sudoku. But this game makes me cry. There isn't enough light to see the little numbers. If you have a bright light shining on it...it's great. It's easy to figure out how to use, but I end up wiping tears away from my stinging, addicted eyes. They should make it bigger and brighter 
 This film is boring, so much so that I could only take 35 minutes of it before I was forced to push stop. This is a soap opera about politics & oil companies. It's weird jump around style is confusing & pointless...do yourself a favor and don't bother w/ this garbage 
   I am not sure what the filmmakers of this train wreck were striving for when they made this low budget movie. I think the film is nothing more than an excuse to film young male actors nude. The film wants to be something it is not--it wants to be a mystery film when in reality it is a no-class softcore porn flick. To call this movie cinema is an insult to filmmakers and to viewers fooled into watching it!   Needless to say I think this film has few, if any, redeeming features. Where to begin? The plot is weak asking us to believe in characters doing things that no one with one ounce of logic would do (for example, the mother leaves home for a few days to visit an aunt knowing her husband recently slugged her son in the face without provocation).    I did not believe for one single moment any of the situations that were happening. The acting? Hmmm. Okay, I'll give the two young male leads some credit here. They made the best of a bad situation. In fact, most of the the young actors were passable (just passable), however, the adults are another story entirely. I would venture the entire movie's dialogue, especially the well-intentioned actress playing "Devon's" mother, was looped. The voices don't sound right. The acting ability of the actor portraying the step-father was about as subtle as the smell of a fertilizer plant... i.e., he reeked!    This movie has cardboard characters possessing no real sense of believability. For those who claim this movie is camp is doing that genre a disservice. I read a few reviews that complained that the young male actors weren't hot enough-- what a ridiculous notion! Those comments miss the point of this film entirely. This was not supposed to be a story about hot men, but about teen exploitation. In effect, what this story tries to warn the viewer against is exactly what the film becomes. The actors were used and used badly by this film's production team.   I lay the blame entirely at the feet of the producer, the writer and director. This amatuer drivel is the worst kind of schlock available to buyers. I could go on and on about how bad this movie truly is. As a writer I can say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Save your money. There are pleny of other gay-themeed films that are worthy of your money and your time. It is not often a film makes me so angry. Stay away from this one! 
 This has got to be the absolutely the sickest bottom of the heap horror movie ever made. You have been warned 
 I do not know what all these 5 star reviews are raving about.  I didn't like this book for several reasons.  They are, in no particular order: It's about too many people and not one of them gets a thorough development--it's just snipets of lots of people's lives.  It's only about women--how boring!  The men in the book are in the background and hardly even named.  This means only mother-daughter relationships are discussed, and it makes for pretty monotonous fare by the end of the book.  Finally, the theme of rebellion against old world culture has potential, but the author gives it a very one-dimensional treatment.  Simply move away from home and drink too much and you're saying something new and different about living in the American melting pot?  In short, I though this book was shallow.  I wouldn't have finished it if not for the book group I read it for 
 ...wow, I have to read this book for college, what is higher education coming to?  So far I'm a fourth of the way through and have no idea what hir theory is.  Ze says one thing and then completely contradicts hirself.  Hir Gender Identity/Power Pyramid is so biased.  Ze spells pyramid wrong, unless "pryamid" is some play on hir words. One of hir points is that to be at the top of the Gender/Power pryamid you must possess a well-formed, above-average-legnth penis.  According to studies on Penis legnth world wide, the Irish are the most well endowed, followed by african americans. So according to Kate's pryamid the Irish should be the #1 super power in the world, followed by Africa at #2. Therefore any high ranking man in the USA must be of Irish descent.    Her pyramid has a foundation of strippers, Mr. Potato Head, aliens and cone headed midgets just to name a few.  Then at the top is a white man, who has no eyes, holding a son who has no eyes.  Basically Kate is evilizing the white heterosexual male who has children.  It almost seems that she is creating this them vs. hir mentality in hir pyramid.  In hir quizzes ze also gives gender points for being "white" and having blue eyes.  Implying hair and eye color has anything to do with gender seems to be a Nazi like theory to me. Ze hirself has blonde hair and blue eyes.  Sounds a bit hypocritical.  Kate may be confused, that could be why there are contridictions throughout the readings.  The evilizing of white, blonde haired blue eyed males seems to stem from self hatred of her former identity.  She also seems to be fixated on genetalia and reproducing children, perhaps steming from the loss of her own penis, whatever size it may have been.   I beleive the point of this book so far has been to confuse you so much that you too will be at a loss for what your gender is and buy more of Kate's confusing books to try to figure it all out.   
 Just when you thought every rediculous theory had been put into print, here comes Sally McFague and her organic model of political correctness.  Can we please have more new definitions for everyday reality?  Before I  read this book, I had no idea that I was a morphic descendent of the  protozoan patrea conspiracy.  If you don't already hate old white men in  America, and you're looking for a reason to, buy this book, and get your  carpet cleaned by Sally McFague 
 This is a collection of articles written for Petrowski's monthly column in American Scientist magazine. Many are brief biographies of 19th-century engineers; a (very) few look (very) briefly at particular pieces of historical engineering (an article on the Ferris wheel is probably the best); others are ruminations on such hazards of the engineering practice as the stress that keeps them up at night and their failure to be awarded Nobel prizes. These seem quite satisfactory articles for a magazine column but they are slender stuff for a book. And Petroski's tendency to return to the same subjects, pardonable in a monthly column, becomes repetitive when the columns are collected. All but die-hard Petroski fans can skip this on 
 Half of a boring book is still boring, and in the case of "Across the Nightingale Floor: Episode 1," it's even worse. Lian Hearn's first novel of the Tales of the Otori has good bones, but the writing has all the warmth and intensity of muddy water.   In the Three Countries, a young boy named Tomasu lives among the Hidden, a small peaceful religious village who don't harm anyone. But one day he returns home to discover that his family has been cruelly slaughtered by Lord Iida. He's almost next, but he's soon saved by the semi-mysterious Lord of the Otori, Shigeru, a sort of renegade lord in the Machievellian world of politics.   Given the name of Takeo, he becomes Otori's ward and is adopted by him on his travels, since he now has no one else. Shigeru also reveals that Takeo is one of the few remaining members of the Tribe, a people with mysterious powers and abilities. Takeo learns more about his new skills, but also learns of the sinister plots he is expected to deal with...   Japanese history and folklore are a much-underused fantasy source, compared to Anglo or Celtic fantasy, which is used in every other fantasy novel you come across. Hearn has definitely done his research, and he seamlessly integrates fantasy elements into a medieval Japanese setting. Concepts such as the Tribe, the complicated political strife and the Nightingale Floor -- a floor that squeaks loudly at the slightest touch -- are fantastic.   What's wrong with the book? The writing. While Hearn has the basic descriptions down of flowers, people, forests and creepy action scenes, nothing comes alive. Tense, dramatic, action-filled scenes are flat and rather slow, and even the slaughter of the hero's entire village is almost instantly forgotten. The good guys are utterly noble in all things, while the bad guys are evil through 'n' through.   Takeo in particular seems passionless and rather dull. He goes through all sorts of harrowing experiences, but doesn't seem to feel anything. Shigeru was so noble and distant that I found it hard to care much about him; he seems like a cardboard standup of a noble renegade hero. Hearn tries to inject a little emotion into the characters from time to time, but they end up seeming manic instead of passionate.   While the idea itself is a very intriguing one, the execution is definitely lacking. Those hoping for a sort of Japanese "Lord of the Rings" won't find the richness they were looking for in "Across the Nightingale Floor"'s first half 
 Color shown as natural is far from accurate. I am unhappy with color and may return these 
 I can't believe someone actually made this movie. The writing seems like its out of a high-school drama class. I would never pay for this movie and i 'm glad my room-mate paid for it. He paid $1 and that was by far WAY too much. The only thing that I can say I got out of this movie is that i can see any movie in the world and it will be better than this. If i ever saw Dean Kain in person i would punch him in the face 
 Amazon strung me along for months before delivering only one volume of the five volume set.  Get it somewhere else 
 The Light of Other Days, ostensibly co-authored by Arthur C. Clarke, is marketed as a philosophically intriguing tale of the transformation of Earth society in the not-so-distant-future, upon the advent of a remote viewing technology that removes all pretense of privacy from people's lives, and even allows observing events in the past. This is an enticing premise, but it's all downhill from page 1. In fact, the premise is all that's left after you discard the juvenile writing style, the paper-thin plot, the one-dimensional characters, and the Discover magazine-grade science.  I actually gave up on it halfway through, after enduring chapter after chapter of egregious exposition. Relentless, finger-wagging infodumps in dialogue and newscasts read like the following (paraphrased, but not the least bit exaggerated): "'As you know, David, the warning signs of global warming went unheeded way back in the early 2000s, and now there's a permanent El Niño.' 'Why yes, Kate, not only is England, which had to become the 52nd U.S. state after international trade collapsed, locked in ice, but more than 60% of the earth's land is no longer farmable.'" The most blatant morality plays in Star Trek aren't even this bad. These passages are also buffered by a superfluous sex scene that tries to appeal to women, but was clearly written by a man.  And then there's this gem of dialogue, at which point the book cannot be taken any less seriously: "It's like what happened to the copyright laws with the advent of the Internet. You remember that? ... No, you're too young. The Global Information Infrastructure--the thing that was supposed to replace the Berne copyright convention--collapsed back in the nought-noughts. Suddenly the Internet was awash with unedited garbage. Every damn publishing house was forced out of business, and all the authors went back to being computer programmers, all because suddenly somebody was giving away for free the stuff they used to sell to earn a crust."  Yeah, 2001 or Rendezvous With Rama this is not; it's nowhere near the quality of Clarke's own masterworks, or any others in the genre, for that matter. That said, though, had this been marketed as a teen/preteen volume, I think it would be tolerable. However, I expected far more sophistication from an adult work, especially one with Clarke's name on it. Save your cash and wait for the TV movie 
 Any student of economics will not be surprised by this disappointing book. Economic theory says that given a change in price amount demanded can 1. increase 2. decrease 3. stay the same. 
 One of the reviewers below stated that admirers of Hurston "won't be disappointed" by this book. I beg to differ: I've read pretty much everything Hurston has written, and I think she is without a doubt one of the best American (and perhaps world) writers of the twentieth century. But "Seraph" was a great disappointment. Hurston simply overreached with this one. By the time I had finished reading it, I found myself wondering what the point of this book was. The story follows the marriage of a Florida couple over several decades. The husband is ambitious and forceful, yet also arrogant and sometimes violent, while the wife is timid and (overly) sensitive. Told from the wife's point of view, the problem with the story is that it essentially goes from a more or less realistic give-and-take between the two to an account of how she tries to prove herself worthy of her husband (there is little in the way of growth on his part by the way, e.g. he never expresses any regret for having acted like a brute during the early years of their marriage). Thus, "Seraph on the Suwanee" basically reads like a romance novel. It's true that anthropologist Hurston provides some interesting details into the lives of the "Florida crackers" (i.e. poor southern whites) in the early 20th century, but this is hardly enough to compensate for the novel's weaknesses. It's hard to believe that the literary genius who wrote "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (among other excellent books) could produce such a lackluster wor 
 I bought this album because I loved the first single "Promiscuous" so much.  The rest of the album is unfortunately quite blah.  There don't seem to be any other standout tracks other than "Promiscuous".  I like that she went in a different direction from her first two albums, but it just doesn't click and most of the tracks are mediocre at best.  I'd recommend just downloading one or two songs on I-Tunes and avoid wasting money on the entire album 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 After listening to this, I would not recommend it to the casual listener.  A very odd and certainly different vocal selections.  Still not one of my favorite singers 
 One of the challenges Don Colbert faced in writing the What Would Jesus Eat Cookbook is whether the book should focus on the foods Jesus did eat in Judea 2000 years ago or on the foods Jesus would eat were He transported to 21st century America. Colbert doesn't seem to have decided which way he wanted to go, possibly because he doesn't quite seem to understand where he was coming from.   A great deal of controversy has been stirred up by Colbert's claims that following the Mosaic laws is healthier than following the standard Western diet. Colbert does not claim that the laws forbidding the consumption of pork, seafood and other foods and food combinations still apply; his premise is simply that following the dietary laws that Jesus did, and eating the foods He would have eaten during His lifetime, is healthier than following our modern diet. However, this premise is undercut by the inclusion of ingredients in well over half the recipes which are completely foreign to the ancient Mediterranean. No Judean (or Roman, for that matter) would have recognized New World foods such as tomatoes, potatoes, hot peppers, and squash or Far Eastern foods such as edameme and soy sauce, yet one or more of these ingredients can be found in over half the recipes. What's more, many of the foods and condiments enjoyed in the Holy Land at the time - fish sauce, lovage, wild mushrooms, and above all wine - are never mentioned, let alone included in a recipe.   But the main criticism I have of this book is its premise. Colbert seems to subscribe to the idea that ancient people were somehow healthier than we moderns, and that our poor diet is the main reason. This is, to be blunt, absolutely false. When Jesus died at age 33, He had lived a longer life than the vast majority of His countrymen. The average age at death under Imperial rule for those who survived childhood was a short 20 years. Those living in Roman-occupied territories tended to be desperately poor by our standards, able to afford little more than whole grain porridge seasoned with fish sauce and supplemented with whatever herbs and mushrooms could be found growing wild. Few could afford fresh vegetables and fruits; beef was virtually unattainable (and not, as Colbert says, eaten once a month) because cattle were needed as draft animals. Fish, a delicacy, was far too expensive for most. The only readily available protein sources were beans and lentils - incomplete and bland. Epidemics carried away far more Judeans than Romans simply because the Romans ate better - more protein, more calcium, more calories.   As for the recipes: I tried four or five, but I was not impressed. Many recipes are simply retreads of modern Mediterranean cooking - incidentally, nothing like ancient Mediterranean cooking - and others seem to have been lifted from the pages of a 1970s hippy cookbook. The blueberry potato salad was literally inedible, the hummus smelled and tasted awful, and the soups were somehow both overspiced and underflavoured.  This book fails in all ways: it doesn't provide a look into the foods Jesus and His followers would have enjoyed, it doesn't make the case for Colbert's version of healthy eating, and it doesn't contain many appetizing recipes 
 Here are excerpts from Avery Cardinal Dulles' review in "First Things" (Oct 2005). _________________ The overarching thesis seems to be that in all these areas social change makes it possible for Christians to overcome the blindness that had previously afflicted their moral vision. The doctrinal change, in Noonan's estimation, is in many cases an about-face, repudiating the erroneous past teaching of the magisterium itself.   More than half of the book deals with slavery...Jesus, though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery, said not a word against slavery as a social institution. Nor did the writers of the New Testament. Peter and Paul exhort slaves to be obedient to their masters. Paul urges Philemon to treat his converted slave Onesimus as a brother in Christ. While discreetly suggesting that he manumit Onesimus, he does not say that Philemon is morally obliged to free Onesimus....   ...[T]he popes were far from silent. As soon as the enslavement of native populations by European colonists started, they began to protest, although Noonan gives only a few isolated examples. Eugene IV in 1435 condemned the enslavement of the peoples of the newly colonized Canary Islands and, under pain of excommunication, ordered all such slaves to be immediately set free. Pius II and Sixtus IV emphatically repeated these prohibitions. In a bull addressed to all the faithful of the Christian world Paul III in 1537 condemned the enslavement of Indians in North and South America. Gregory XIV in 1591 ordered the freeing of all the Filipino slaves held by Spaniards. Urban VIII in 1639 issued a bull applying the principles of Paul III to Portuguese colonies in South America and requiring the liberation of all Indian slaves.   In 1781 Benedict XIV renewed the call of previous popes to free the Indian slaves of South America. Thus it was no break with previous teaching when Gregory XVI in 1839 issued a general condemnation of the enslavement of Indians and Blacks. In particular, he condemned the importation of Negro slaves from Africa. Leo XIII followed along the path set by Gregory XVI.   ...In A Church That Can and Cannot Change, Noonan gives only a few glimpses of this complex history. He correctly notes that the Catholic magisterium in past centuries never made an absolute condemnation of slavery as such. But he contends that John Paul II reversed the traditional teaching. In support he quotes a statement of John Paul II in 1992. Speaking at the infamous "House of Slaves" on the Island of Gore in Senegal, from which innumerable slaves had been exported, he declared: "It is fitting to confess in all truth and humility this sin of man against man, this sin of man against God." Noonan adds: "What this confession did not remark was how recently the sin had been discovered." But if we look up the quotation, we will find that the pope is here speaking of the slave trade, which had repeatedly been condemned. Far from changing the doctrine, John Paul is explicitly reaffirming the position of Pope Pius II, whom he quotes as having declared in 1492 that the slave trade was an enormous crime, magnum scelus.   Noonan has one further argument for doctrinal change. In 1993, in his encyclical Veritatis Splendor, John Paul II took, from Vatican II's pastoral constitution on the Church in the modern world, a long list of social evils: "homicide, genocide, abortion, euthanasia and voluntary suicide . . . mutilation, physical and mental torture and attempts to coerce the spirit; whatever is offensive to human dignity, such as sub-human living conditions, arbitrary imprisonments, deportation, slavery, prostitution and trafficking in women and children; degrading conditions of work which treat laborers as mere instruments of profit, and not as free responsible persons." Where Vatican II had called these practices "shameful" (probra), John Paul II calls them "intrinsically evil." In the same encyclical the pope teaches that intrinsically evil acts are prohibited always and everywhere, without any exception.  Did John Paul II, by including slavery in his list of social evils, effect the revolution in Catholic moral theology that Noonan attributes to him? It seems to me that if he had wanted to assert his position as definitive he would have had to say more clearly how he was defining slavery. He would have had to make it clear that he was rejecting the nuanced views of the biblical writers and Catholic theologians for so many past centuries. If any form of slavery could be justified under any conditions, slavery as such would not be, in the technical sense, intrinsically evil.   According to the logic of Noonan's argument, whatever holds for slavery would have to be said for deportations, subhuman living conditions, and degrading conditions of work. But could not degrading or subhuman conditions be inevitable, for example, after some great natural disaster in which mere survival is an achievement? Individual deportations of undesirable aliens occur continually as a matter of national policy today; mass deportations could perhaps be necessary for the sake of peace and security. If pressed, I suspect, the pope would have admitted the need for some qualifications, but he could not have specified these without a rather long excursus that would have been distracting in the framework of his encyclical. So far as I am aware, he never repeated his assertion that slavery is intrinsically evil. Neither the Catechism of the Catholic Church nor the recent Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church... speaks so absolutely.   For all these reasons Noonan's case for a reversal of doctrine is unconvincing. Jacques Maritain provided some helpful distinctions in his book The Rights of Man and Natural Law....[C]ertain attenuated forms of servitude, such as serfdom, are not opposed to natural law except in its secondary requirements or aspirations. These lesser forms of servitude...cannot be eliminated except by degrees....These concessions do not seem to me to be a reversal of the original teaching but rather a nuancing of it. 
 Ok, I bit and bought a copy after seeing all the hype. I was disappointed to discover that it's not the book you are led to believe it is.  There's next to nothing in it about starting or running an online business. Now this is truly bizarre considering who the author is.   If you are looking at starting an old fashioned off-line type business, then it might be helpful. Suppose you wish to start a vacuum cleaner agency from your kitchen table or an mlm distributorship. Then I could see this being of some help. It's basically about all about dialling for donuts endlessly from home.  There's also very little of Gianforte in the book. Reading it you can't escape the conclusion that he farmed it out to his co-author, who then did all the work. Unfortunately the co-author is a journalist and not a businessman, so he focussed on the wrong things, in my opinion.  If you are looking at starting an online business, go with "Go Big or Go Home" by Wil Schroter. Now that's the book that deserves this one's hype 
 I was truly impressed by the utter emptiness of this new novel.  But I have no one else to blame but myself, since I knew nothing about it before shelling out over $24.  I should have been more on guard, but I wasn't.  What I found when I opened the cover and turned the pages was something like a tribute to the cliche, a celebration of lame, flabby banality, a festivel of mediocrity, nicely tarted up as a "brainy cultural commentary" (an actual review quote).  The only brainy thing about this book was the slick con job pulled off by the Knopf marketing department.  They deserve five stars.    The "characters" in this brainy cultural commentary all seem to have stopped growing around the age of 12.  The dialogue is agonizingly weak and it is not resurrected by the use of punctuation oddities or tinkering with the margins.  She ain't no e.e. cummings.  I kept wondering if I had left the television on as I was reading this brainy cultural commentary.  But it was not on, that was the tinny sound of the two dimensional nonentities who populate this book yakking at each other.  This is surely on my top ten list of truly bad novels, up there with The Historian by Whatshername Kostova.  Do yourself a favor and move away from this section of the bookstore with "intelligence and velocity" (another quote from inside the dust jacket. 
 This book would have been granted a much higher rating if not for the errors, and this book has plenty of them.  Many of the errors are numbers-related and don't have a significant impact on the particular story (the Packers started playing in Milwaukee in 1933, not 1932 as stated in the story 'Good Times and Bad Times'), or a draft position (Ezra Johnson was a first-round pick, not a second according to the story 'Ezra'). But some of the errors do significantly alter the story: In 'Terrible Tony' the story implies that the Packers were "obsessive" about drafting Tony Mandarich rather than "taking a flier" on Troy Aikman. Aikman was the first pick in the draft, selected by Dallas, before the Packers ever had a chance. He was not bypassed by the Packers, and any team that was in the Packer's position (second pick in the draft) probably would have taken Mandarich, too. Along with the errors are inconsistencies: According to 'The Man in Charge,' "Bob Harlan announces in 1995 that the Packers would no longer play in Milwaukee," while 'An Era Ends' correctly states that 1994 was the last year. Harlan made the announcement in 1994, before the regular season had ended.  The short stories, nonetheless, are entertaining, and Packer fans - even the most knowledgeable - are sure to have their memories jarred about a long-forgotten item or two about their beloved team. But that same knowledgeable fan - and there are many - is sure to be distracted by the many mistakes that plague this book. Yes, the book is entertaining, but you certainly wouldn't use it for reference 
 I purchased this humidifier, and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week. One night, it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again. I called the company, who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out, and they would be sending a new one to replace it (with no cost for shipping to me). I received the new one a week later, which to my disappointment, did not have the nightlight feature. I also noticed it was from a different brand company. I can't remember the name but it also began with the word "sun." So far, the new humidifier is working fine (about 2 weeks now), but it has a lower water capacity so I have to refill it every night (vs. every 2 nights with the original one) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment. The process of replacing, however, was very smooth and also free so I'll give them 2 stars for that 
 This book is filled with so many implausibilities and plot holes that it hardly works as an espionage thriller. Even though Trevanian provides heavyhanded clues throughout the narration that the book is intended as a parody, I am unwilling to grant him such a silly cop-out. The story basically pits a conspiratorial corporate megalith against a resourceful assassin. Although the assassin has Western lineage, he grows up in China and Japan, and is informally educated in Eastern mysticism. Unfortunately, this back story is lengthy and overwrought, and hardly describes how this son of a high-class whore develops such a pathological indifference to human life. We only learn that he has the ability to enter a trancelike state of Shibumi, in which he experiences some kind of metaphysical bliss, but loses that ability after murdering his surrogate father, a Japanese general on trial for war crimes during World War II, and being beaten in prison. While in prison, he develops some kind of psychic power to detect people's moods and proximity, although that ability is not worth mentioning, because it never advances the plot. The assassin also is an expert at sex; again, who but the most sexually squeamish adolescent would care? If the backstory were not tedious enough, Trevanian inflicts readers with a lengthy, self-indulgent chapter about exploring a cave that does nothing to advance the plot.  The plot finally begins to advance in the last 50 pages of the book, and basically amounts to a tale of revenge. Unfortunately, there are a zillion loose ends. The all-powerful corporate bad guy, Mr. Diamond, wants revenge on the assassin, Nicholai Hel, for killing his brother (the brother had tortured Hel in prison). So, why didn't Diamond seek revenge years ago?  Did he really need the pretense of Hel's involvement in an attempt to thwart a terrorist hijacking? Also, why did Hel have to try to thwart the hijacking, when the British government, fearing an embarassment that Hel threatens, ends up killing all the witnesses on board the plane and crashing it into the ocean? Finally, Hel appears motivated only to get involved in thwarting the hijacking to repay an old acquaintance and to save the whales. The characters are equally thin. Bad guy Mr. Diamond is crudely drawn and is an easy target for hackneyed, anti-Western, anticapitalist ridicule. "Good guy" Hel is a haughty, self-absorbed misogynist with a nearly delusional sense of Japanese history that conveniently ignores that country's long list of atrocities, particularly in World War II. All the women characters are described in terms of their abilities to please chauvinistic men. The descriptions of Arab characters demonstrate Trevanian's bigotry. Hel's friend, a cartoonishly self-righteous Basque, LeCagot, provides comic relief, and is the only likable character in the book. Instead of developing the plot or the characters, Trevanian treats the reader to rants about Western society, Arabs, New York City, U.S. college students, French people, the British, the CIA, oil companies, and almost everything else not bearing the imprint, "Made in Japan." They are all easy targets, but the sign of a talented storyteller is the ability to provide these targets with some character and humanity before knocking them down. Find something else to read 
 If you are looking for good book to read to young children at Thanksgiving, this isn't it.    Not only is it not a good read-aloud, it argues against the traditional telling of the Pilgrims story.  In fact, at the end of the book the author, Kate Waters,  talks about how the traditional turkey-pilgrim-indian autumn feast is a mythical occurrence.   She says that while historians don't know what `really' happened, it wasn't what the present day holiday conjures up in all of our collective memories.  Instead, what we should know is that European fishermen and traders brought plague that killed whole villages.   And that it was just a coincidence that there were any Native Americans at Plimouth (alternate spelling of Plymouth) on the day there was to be a harvest feast, an event that was, in fact,  rather a rare occurrence of celebration for the Pilgrams as they did not deem it appropriate celebrate *any* holidays, not even Easter and Christmas.  (ho-ho-ho)  Which brings us to the substance of the book when considered for older readers (older tweenies or teenagers perhaps).    It is an attractive book to look at.  There are pictures of re-enactors in a colonial setting, but  it basically centers around a time where all the houses are built and everybody is fat and happy.  No Mayflower.  No hardship.    And ironically, while the author argues that you won't find the `true' story of life in early colonial times in other books, you won't find it here either  because the author's own re-enactors - pilgrams and native americans alike-- are incredibly clean and tidy individuals.  Everyone in crisp linen and wool or deerskin.   Even the children!  LOL  Two Stars.  A terrible book for young children.  It might hold more interest for older children as the pictures are interesting.   See Amazon's "Search inside this book" feature to judge for yourself.  Example of text:  "I throw the ball but miss the stool broadly.  It lands near the feet of an Indian boy who is standing at the edge of the forest.  He throws the ball back to me.  I know him not but I give him greeting.  He answers back in his tongue.  I see him surveying our men at arms and the cleared field.  I run to tell my friend Bartle, but when we look back, the boy has disappeared into the forest.  I wonder why he watches us?   [Note:  My children and I suggest you take a look at  "The Pilgrim's First Thanksgiving" by Ann McGovern. 
 I bought 2 of these things for my granddaughters.  I could NOT get either one to give a "wet" lick.  However, the tongue did move and it made a licking sound.  It was almost pornographic 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 However, Amazon does not allow zero star ratings...  I can't even dignify this by calling it a book. Isn't the beauty of Aesop's fables mainly in the brevity of them? Consider the amzing power of Jesus' ultra concise parables. Then take a look at this clunker. If you tried to tow the Queen Mary with a bungee cord, you could not stretch the bungee further than Johnson has stretched his parable in this book. If you actually enjoy this book and get something out of it, perhaps you should hunt up a copy of Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music."  This is the pet rock of literature here. We all wish we had come up with the idea and pocketed the cash. But genius it ain't. Just light your money on fire, if you need to get rid of some. That would be more fun than reading this book 
 bad bo 
 This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed. 
 I found this book really wordy and confusing.  The images are not numbered and do not have full refrenced captions, which makes finding infomation on a particualar image very difficult.  Also, the chapters are in chronological order, yet several images and some information is not in the chapter of the correct time period.  This would be fine if those images from a time period other than what the chapter covers were being compared to images from the time period, but they are not ever that i noticed.   
 This book not only consists of bad nutritional advice but dangerous suggestions. Ms. Kleiner calls herself a nutrition consultant, but believes that peppermint patties are a good way to end a meal and that blue sports drinks are good for you. This book not only can kill a hypoglycemic with its high-carbohydrate suggestions, but is proof of how ignorant the educated can be. Ms. Kleiner and Ms. Robinson are not herbalists, yet they discount every herb that Eastern civilizations have thrived on for thousands of years- while ignoring the fact that prescribed drugs kill 100,000 individuals a year in this country alone. The authors easily condemn Ginseng, a Chinese adaptogen used for thousands of years, and sanction the use of Ephedra which has been shown to be life threatening in many cases. The authors concern themselves with the illusion that blue sports drinks, candy, and refined carbos are the best fuel for a healthy body, but they are themselves a product of an ignorant, drug-generated-for-profit country. Too bad their illusion is in print for the uninformed and unaware. As the old saying goes, don't believe all that you read- especially this book. Maybe the authors should go back to school and learn something and then attempt to take people's lives and diets in their hands. Wasted trees to make this one 
 Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books.  We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption 
 I have the first book this author wrote, and was extremely disappointed to find out that at least half the blocks in her new book are repeated from her first book. I feel that the title is misleading. Several of the authors of multiple volumes on the same subject are in my library. Examples would be Bethany Reynolds, Marsha McCloskey, Sharyn Craig, and Carol Doak. In each and every case, the blocks or techniques do not repeat the items that appeared in their earlier books. Therefore, it's logical to expect that a book entitled "More Biblical Blocks" would have  additional blocks to the ones you already have.   Have you ever bought a CD of an artist you liked to find out that half or more of the songs were repeats from one you already owned? Well, this is the equivalent. Since the book isn't cheap, it's doubly disappointing.  Whereas I do agree that the directions are guite good, they are no better than those contained in many other books on the market by other authors, so there is nothing remarkable in that arena. If you have this author's "Biblical Blocks" book, I'd recommend skipping this one. If you're considering buying one of her books, buy only this one and skip the first, so it can have value to some. I, however, feel ripped off 
 I enjoyed Separation Sunday tremendously, an original (although not for everyone) album full of hard rocking music and raucous lyrics to match.  As a thitrysomething, I found the lyrics on Sep. Sun. to be a clever look at the party scene and the passage of time, with both the highs and lows of growing out of the mayhem and into adulthood, or reaching your own "resurrection".  This new album (Boys and Girls) is much more drab, with less of an in-your-face delivery of fairly lame lines that I would be emarrased to listen to if I were older than 20.  These are juvenile songs which sound aimed at the MTV generation, with cheesy lines and hooks.  I had thought this band was the real deal, and had argued as such, but after hearing this it is clear they are a bunch of posers. 
 Rechargables last only 1/10 of the time of regular battery.  With two small children and lots of toys that need batteries, I was extremely excited about getting rechargable batteries.  However, I used them in one of my daughters toys and was shocked when they needed to be recharged in 2 days. Regular batteries last 3 weeks.  I called Energizer and they confirmed that rechargebles do not last as long. A regular D battery has 22,000mAh versus the rechargeable 2550mAh.  Think before you buy 
 The paper used to print this worthless screed was wasted. This is a typical geographical put down based on regional stereotyping. Drufresne assumes everyone in a given location is totally ignorant and comical. What an insult! How did this manuscript ever get accepted for publication 
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 This is a poor remake of a classic.  I could barely sit through the thing.  The action scenes are good, yet unbelievable.  The sex seens with Alec and Kim are done well.  Otherwise, the movie sucks.  The basic plot is poorly laid out and therefore vaguely interesting, but the subplots are ridiculous.  Alec Baldwin does a crummy job of portraying the tough guy in this movie - he comes off arrogant and smug more than anything else.  Kim Basinger is great in her role, but overshadowed by the rest of the poor acting and stupid subplots that surround her.  Jennifer Tilly does a good job in an idiotic role.  If you want to see Kim Basinger naked, borrow this movie from someone else.  Bottom line - don't waste your money on it - you'll be mad at yourself if you do.  Only a complete idiot could enjoy this crummy film 
 If you like trashy, you'll love it.  I like a little more romance. This was more soft porn! I didn't see the romance, only the physical relationship.  It was okay 
 Since Avant's debut CD, My Thoughts, I really enjoyed the songs because they combined different artists' qualities (including Joe and R. Kelly), and I really wanted another "Joe", smooth operator, kind of singer.  Well, each CD just got worse and worse, as in many cases with singers, and the end result is this: a cd full of filler songs.  The only one that I kind of enjoy is 4 Minutes.  I'm dissapointed that he's transitioning into a very mainstream singer and is sounding more and more monotonous.  Well, I guess if you can sing and dress well, you got made anyways.. 
 I bought this book for my Pre-K class, to go along with our weather unit on Rain. The cover looked so nice I thought it would be a great book. In fact, the illustrations are quite nice; the problem is there's really no story here. The language doesn't flow; its very choppy. The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 A few days ago I was delighted to learn The Stepford Wives would be shown on cable TV, but I soon realized I was watching a turkey. The opening scene is a heavy handed parody of the Jerry Springer show, and from that point it's downhill all the way.   The plot is weak, the characters inconsistent, and the story incoherent. The production values of casting, costuming and set design are certainly high. But that just makes this movie a pointless, glossy mess 
 The quality is not consistant with all the other items I have ordered from Amazon.  The pages of the book fall apart easily. Also, the recemmended age group is 9-12 and the book uses profanity.  It is not necessary to use such profanity or any profanity for this age group.  I have returned the item and will be more cautious in the future 
 Not sure if all pumps are this loud...but goodness this one is so loud it hurt my ears...also the attachments that come with it (for different size holes) are not affixed to the pump so you have to hold the attachments on the blower while it is filling up the item and the cord is not on the side of the pump, it's on the bottom so you cannot even set the pump down while it is inflating the item. It is just a bit awkward.  I used it to blow up an inflatable Castle for my 20 month old and there are several areas to blow up and some of them are a bit awkward and trying to hold the pump AND hold the attachments on the pump with one hand was a bit aggrevating 
 This band just sucks. The music and vocals just don't mix right. The singer sounds like he would fit in better with Rush than how he sounds with this band. Although, the music does sound decent, the singer's voice just brings it all down. I had the chance of picking this CD up numerous times for $9.99 and just recently came across it for $5.99 brand new but decided against it... I'm glad I decided otherwise. And in response to another reviewer: Unloco is not just rock! They are metal even though you stated otherwise. Bye 
 Paul is new to Gate, a school whose rich students make life miserable for anyone not like them, and Paul is definitely not like them.  One day something incredible happens -- Charlie Good, a star athlete, invites Paul to join his inner circle.  All Charlie wants is a few things in return, things Paul does willingly in order to be accepted.  Paul knows the things he's doing are wrong, but he also knows if he doesn't do them, he will be picked on again.  One day Charlie wants something big - he wants Charlie to plant a bomb at school, claiming that he doesn't know how to do it.  Therefore, technically, Paul will be responsible and to blame.  Paul's conscience tells him to confess, but when he claims the idea was Charlie's, Charlie lies and says he had nothing to do with it.  Consequently, Paul is punished for being honest and Charlie is deemed innocent, although he initiated the whole idea and planned it. For mature readers only because of much offensive language and subject matter 
 This book has some good information but you have to wade through the fat to get at it.  It may be written mainly for aspiring college students, but I feel it is not complete enough or deep enough for parents.  There are many other better books out there on the subject (notably Fiancial Aid for Dummies and Discounts and Deals at the Nations best 360 colleges) 
 I was so excited when a friend (knowing how much I'd loved "The Secret Life of Bees") sent me a copy of "The Mermaid Chair." That excitement was dampened a bit when I read the story synopsis-- as a Catholic, I'm heartily tired of stories involving monks, priests or nuns having illicit affairs. Deciding to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt, however, I plowed ahead and started reading.  My initial opinion of the writing was poor, and it remained as such throughout the tome. In "Bees," Kidd wrote magically-- her words were as almost as sweet as the honey she penned about. This mermaid tale, however, was a completely different animal-- the style was totally altered, almost as though it was written by another (and much less talented) author. Basically, it didn't flow; it moreorless limped from chapter to chapter.  I also found the main character very hard to like or root for. I didn't mind that she was having a midlife crisis-- some people have their most interesting experiences as a result of such inner conflict-- but her reaction to it was childish, petulant and ultimately harmful to her supposed loved ones. For example, instead of telling her husband what's on her mind (a husband who, incidentally, is described as nothing but genial and accommodating), she runs away and has an affair. I would've been much more inspired by this character if she'd channeled her passionate energies into something else, something bold and brave and true-- NOT avoiding her husband (as though he, not she, were the reason her artistic aspirations were frozen) and having sex with a monk.  And yes, my reservations about reading a story involving a religious having sex were not without merit. I was particularly disgusted when, during one of their romps together, she tasted "the wine" in his mouth left over from Mass. Catholics believe that during the course of Mass, the wine changes into Christ's blood, so you can understand why I found that passage really quite offensive and sacriligious. And maybe that's why, when I grimly finished the book shortly thereafter, I deposited it in the wastebasket rather than in a donation pile-- I would hate to pass such a story on.  All in all, I found nothing to praise in this book, nothing that inspired me as "Bees" did, nothing that made me nod and smile and feel enriched afterward. Instead, I was by turns bored, irritated and offended. I didn't expect a "Bees" copycat, but I did expect, when leafing through those pages, to feel the magic again. It just didn't happen 
 I bought this because I love Joy Behar and I like the idea that it was benefiting a good cause, but my five year old did not enjoy it - I found it to be a tongue-in-cheek adult version of a child's book.  The name itself has three different ways to say a four letter word begining with "s" and ending in "t!"  That's why it's funny!  But it's just not funny to a five year old like I thought it might be. Buy it for the good cause, but not because you think a five year old will giggle through it.   
 Most of the information is very "theoritical" and "limited" -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her.  ...  In a nutshell, the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter(s), and in turn, the daughter(s) may pass that onto her offspring(s).  ...   
 First, my background: I am not a mathematician, but an academic with fair knowledge of college math and even some advanced materials. I do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians.   This book is obviously a work of great effort by the author. My difficulty probably came from the work's ambitious premise: offering mathematical and biographical history of Hilbert's problems. There are simply too many ideas and persons (some well known, others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself) to cover in one book.  The author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources. My impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers, and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages.  The result: the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem, some necessary ideas introduced, who the major solvers were, then a short biography of each solver, when and where they were born, who their parents were, where they went to school, who they married and so on; then another cycle begins. Halfway into the book, I began to get bored.   I can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes, but lay readers much beware. I recommend lay readers to check out a few pages  carefully online or at your local library to see whether you like it. I certainly didn't hate it but did not like it as much as I expected 
 It almost seemed like the acting got worse after every season.  I'm really a big fan of what's happening. There is a episode where Raj is singing a ballad which I found really funny, because I never thought I would ever see Earnest Thomas (raj) sing a song with so much sincerity.  The third season is really corny, however, if you have  been a on going fan you will enjoy watching many of the episodes.....if you were never a fan of what's happening! don't waste your money, or just buy the second  season (the best season)  and call it  a day 
 This book is really disappointing, because it has very little to do with the title of the book. It is a total waste of money. After reading this book, you will hardly thing like Graham and invest like Buffett. No chance! Read the first two books from Hagstrom and Buffetts letters to the shareholders. Dont by this one. Terrible 
 Rather disappointed. Only a few real usefull hints, some obvious "secrets", very disorganized, no logic structure.  I will be more careful selecting my next purchase espacially as I had to pay 10 Euro on top for the customs.. 
 I have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources. Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment! There are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies, like the Shadow, Batman etc, which is interesting.   Nevertheless, Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Liam Neeson, Larry Drake, and Frances McDormand among others.  It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement.  In an effort to exact revenge, he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims....   In short, the acting and the plot are average (nothing great), while the dialogues are way below average.  The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.   The characters are, overall, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. Rick Anderson played by the "fool," Ted Raimi, from the Xena series). Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...   In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  No masterpiece here... 2 Stars 
 Dr. LaHaye's commentary on Revelation offers a biased, non-scholarly view of Revelation that is based more on a tradition that is less than 200 years old  than it is based on sound exegesis.  For a real commentary on Revelation, read either George Eldon Ladd's A Commentary on the Revelation of John (Historical Pre-millennial) or Ray Summers' Worthy is the Lamb (Amillennial) 
 I never write in reviews but this is the worst cookbook I've ever bought.  We probably have 40 or 50.    There are only 101 recipes and 7 of them are for either rabbit or venison.  I don't know anyone who cooks either.   The index in the back is listed in page order.  I'm not making this up.  Usually you turn to the back and look up beef or chicken or whatever and it shows you the recipes for that ingredient.  When you look at the index here it gives the name of the recipe on the first page and then the 2nd page.   Don't buy this!  I'd give it a zero if I could.       
 If you can actually get the picture to turn out right, it does take pretty decent pictures.  Most of the time the photo is either over-exposed or too dark and grainy.  It also only holds about 5 pictures, so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot.  I was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars, and it doesn't really seem worth it 
 but hated this movie.  What a silly premise - a big game hunter getting together people who happened to be in the vicinity of mutilation attacks on humans - and then he tells them that one of them is a werewolf and that he's going to kill it!!!??? Then, one by one each guest is systematically killed.  The movie could have ended 1 hour earlier (I think it's 1 hour 30 minutes long), and had the same, tiring outcome. Very monotonous, and tedious. I wouldn't recommend it 
 Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as "boring".  The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary.  I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works.  But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over.  I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to.  Too bad - I know I won't buy that one.  I LOVE to read and "consume" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.  Yet, I've been "trudging" through this one for weeks - not days 
 All in all useful, but not nearly enough variety in the thesaurus. Many of  the alternate words given were basically the same vein as the original.  Often If anything, most of the alternates given seemed to be a dumbed down  version of the word you were using 
 First, it was published too soon. When I got to the end,I discovered the suspect in the case hasn't even had a trial yet. When I read a true crime book I want to know the conclusion of the case. Second, apparently there wasn't enough information for a whole book because the author had to resort to using numerous other unrelated cases as filler. And that is what makes the third thing wrong with this book. The author jumps around from case to case so much that it is distracting. I got a headache just trying to keep all the names, places and cases in order. If you still want to read this book; at least wait until they print an updated version after the trial is over. Then you will know how the story ends 
 After purchasing the instructor's manual to check my answers, I found errors in every chapter!!  From spelling to incorrect percentage amounts.  I found myself editing the entire time to find their errors which contradict their text.  When I got answers that were not an option in the multiple choice exercises, I would reference the book and the textbook would say I was correct, and the workbook did not.  Not worth the money or the time.  Extremely exhausting 
 I purchased this DVD assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas.  The focus is on the abs, where the back comes into play.  But there are no exercises designed just to targot the back.  In fact, Michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form.  A good cardio workout, alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn.  A good abs and waist workout as well.  There are alot of twisting moves.  The exercises are very similar to tae-bo, and I would recommend a tae-bo video over this one.  Michael only performs half of the exercises himself.  He also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention.  I wouldn't go through this workout though, and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience.     He also uses handweights, a jump-rope, and a body bar during the workout.  But its easy to manage without them.  
 Anyone that knows anything about Milken knows that the guy created millions of jobs, and contributed much more to society than people like James Stewart, who often act like parasites at the expense of others.  And what about Milken's life after this whole affair? I wonder what Stewart will write about in the sequel, since Milken has taken on a life of philanthropy basically unrivaled, and certainly contributes more to this country than most. Milken's creation of a liquid market for junk bonds allowed credit risk to be redistributed throughout the capital markets, effectively creating more capital, more jobs, and more wealth creation.   Anyone up and coming in IB, or looking to inform themselves of the 80's capital movement, please at least check out some other perspectives on the era.   Note: These comments don't apply to Boesky or the arbs who were doing nothing but breaking the law. I would argue a strong distinction between Milken and most of the other characters in this book 
 I guess this author doesn't bother to check his "facts". Too much work perhaps. Many, many errors. Clearly, he didn't even bother to read Asimov's autobiography completely. One of many errors: He thinks Marty Greenberg and Martin H. Greenberg are the same person. In Asimov's autobiography, he says in several places they are 2 different people. Asimov goes to great lengths in his autobiography to stress they are 2 different people. So much so, that he he refers to MHG as 'Marty the Other' in several places. This is just one of several errors. When someone makes as many errors as White does, how can you trust anything he says? Although Asimov wrote fiction and non-fiction, White seems to have blended the 2 in one book. However, how can you tell which part is fiction and which part is non-fiction? 
 Quigley was a Georgetown professor who was permitted access for two years in the early 1960's to the private archives of the Committee on Foreign Relations, a Rockefeller internationalist organization that compliments the work of the Trilateral Commission and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.    It is difficult to determine what the author is trying to communicate.  There is no continuity to the book; nothing ties together Quigley's version of the past and of the future.  It's like reading about the solar system and finding out that the conclusion of the matter is that the sun will expand and burn everything up.  You are left wondering, what is the point?    We are left with the suggestion that the elite should continue to guide us in the same direction that we are traveling, but avoiding some of the monumental blunders that they have made in the past.  Quigley's version of history consists mostly of unquestioning repetition of propaganda.  Quigley did a superficial job of analyzing history, and he is even worse at sociology.  He touts Inclusive Diversity as our great strength and greatest gift.  Perhaps he should have considered the aphorism, "Divide and conquer."  The West, or any other empire, can only flourish when it concentrates on matters of common concern, not divisivness    Quigley does slightly better with economics and foreign policy, which are more in his area of expertise.  He correctly observes that British and American "victories" in WWI and WWII resulted in the almost total destruction of international law.  Quigley is in favor of the idea of continental blocs replacing national states.  As globalization unfolds, Quigley exposes some of the hypocrisy and bungling, yet  he inexplicably remains committed to the overall plan.  So, what is the point of all of this costly meddling?  Quigley predicts success...and then failure.  "We shall undoubtedly get a Universal Empire in which the U.S. will rule most of Western Civilization.  This will be followed by a period of decay and ultimately by invasions and the total destruction of Western culture."  Couldn't we save ourselves the trouble and just mind our own business?     Minding our own business is a concept based on the idea that the electorate is in control of the government, and that we have a choice.  However, Quigley admits that international financiers influence and control governments.  Quigley says that the internationalists, who prefer to remain in the background, should be known for their "valuable" contributions.  What these contributions amount to is that they want world government, and they intend to cram it down everyone's throats.  As we slouch toward financial, industrial, and government monopoly the author reminds us of some of the casualties.  "As economic enterprises have become larger and more tightly integrated into one another, the freedom, individualism, and initiative traditionally associated with the modern economy have to be sacrificed." Quigley acknowledges that in our future, "In general, there will be a very considerable modification of the areas and objectives of freedom in all societies of the world, with gradual reduction of numerous personal freedoms of the past."  To add to this loss of freedom, Quigley bemoans our loss of a spiritual mooring and suggests a return to the values of Christianity!   His version of Christianity, of course.  Still full of contradictions, Quigley cleaves to relativism rather than absolutes, approximations rather than final answers-not realizing that the adoption of these mindsets are what weakened the appeal of Christianity.  Finally, as we follow our present course, Quigley predicts an age of conflict characterized by class struggle, war, irrationality, and declining progress. Obviously, we're there now.     Rather than attack his sponsors, who are bringing us this New World Order, Quigley vents his frustration on the middle class.  Quigley touts the moral superiority of both the rich and poor, but he asserts that the middle class consists of poorly-informed, neurotic, bourgeois, radical-right Republicans. Worst of all, they have Puritanical attitudes toward sex.   The many internal contradictions in this book indicate a confused mind or a shallow thinker.  The author's history is mostly stale propaganda, spiced up with occasional pro-government cheerleading or tales of government boondoggles.   Maybe if Quigley had broken this monstrosity into several different books, he would have had something coherent to say.  In this book, Quigley's  conclusion is almost totally divorced from the rest of the book.  This effort spanned 20 years, and possibly senility was sneaking up on the author.    
 I ordered the product thinking that it should be good for the price. But it doesnot keep the warm water warm for 10 mintues. The pedicure set is hard to use. The bubbles are not effective.I guess cheap is expensive!!! 
 I like Patagonia and admire the company's philosophies, but this book felt like one big, long self-aggrandizing advertisement for the company.  The title of the book really says it all if you're looking for good business management practices.  No need to read any further.  But the history of the company is quite interesting, and their efforts to be environmentally responsible are inspiring 
 Only read the first chapter... Sorry. As people criticize China without being there, I guess I have the right to criticize this book without reading it entirely. So I guess this is just another book about how China wants to conquer the world. Unfortunately, this is not the only one. Let's review the first chapter very quickly. It is beginning with US-(NATO) bombing of China's ambassy in 1999...Mmmmh...Let me see... Where is the threat ? Ah and China was focusing its anger against US through their media (May be a Chinese Foxnews?). Really strange these Chinese people. Then it continues with the China's Communist plan where we have details about how US is spying China's airwaves.   I am wondering if the author has ever been to China or if he only relies on "intelligence" reports ? (May the same guys that found WMD in Irak ?).Unfortunately, this book is not available in eBook version, it seemed pretty funny 
 I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back 
 This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. How convenient that Amazon lists the good reviews first. That means most people won't read this. However, I'll give my two cents worth anyway. Several previous reviews state this book is funny, it's not! The book has no plot, no ending, and only a very fragmented, mostly deranged stream of thought in between. I can only guess that Ms. Smith was trying to be clever with her rambling list of web sites, use of etc. every few lines and endless droning on about cliches. It all falls flat because it all leads to no where and nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your money for something by a different author 
 I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.  The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.  Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.  The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's naï¿½ve and unique generosity.  That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.   For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!  In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.  She wants readers to get an "insight into the psychology" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.  My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.   I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is "The Virgin's Lover"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel "The Queen's Fool" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful "Earthly Joys" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)  So, get "The Other Boleyn Girl" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).   But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's "Legacy" 
 Soundgarden was horrible tripe, along with Temple of the Dog and Audioslave.  His solo work is no better, but unlike the other three bands, at least this didn't have the ridiculously high sales, infact, it flopped in that area!!  It could have been the end of this overrated ego-maniac, but Tommy the Commie Morello just had to hire him and form Audioslave.  Now to this CD, its no different from the other radio-rock out there; its boring, untalented, and irritating.  I hate you, Tom and Chris 
 I hoped to find a great amount of content from this Catholic Priest. I have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of God was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the Lord.  Father Tom accurately describes that guilt issue. However, instead of expressing how he found the Lord to be a forgiving God and that we are in need of accepting His grace, Tom moves into a diatribe of Panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. If you don't know, Panentheism is a way of explaining that "Everything is in God". At the surface that sounds great. But there is more to it. It also ascribes that God is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. Man. That is a leap...since God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and He was so BEFORE he made the earth.  OK>..so you see. Tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.  If you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. Instead, buy a bible. Holman Press just came out with a great one. Read the first few verses of Romans chapter 8. Then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. If you want the short answer. Hear it is. "We are not ever going to be good enough. And that is OK. God forgives all of us. Just accept that fact." Don't stop trying though. It helps others see the Good in GOD when they see it. Being good is not for going to heaven. It is to help show others that there is a good God to go to heaven to see! 
 another product that fails to mention that it is for windows. I really believe that most people who use the product, would own a MAC. The product was well written, and highly informative, but of little use to a  MAC owner. 
 I was sorely disapointed with this book.  I was hoping for the majority of it to be background and detail that wasn't covered in the series.  Unfortunately, other than some "physical data" on many of the star systems, a few in depth histories and one or two other tidbits, most of the information in here is directly from the trilogy, just repackaged.  This book was a waste of my money 
 I first encountered the words of Wayne Dyer 5 or so years ago on PBS. I liked what I heard. Though nothing he says is original, I did like the way he presented it.  The first book of his I read was "There's A Spiritual Solution to Every Problem", the book on which the first lecture I watch on PBS was based.  I was inspired by, and enjoyed that book. As I did the next two or three. But recently, and especially with this latest volume, he simply repackages his older books in a different form. Ironic for a book about inspiration.  I want to be clear that I have no intrinsic problem with some of the concepts he talks about. But this book, and his lectures, and overall attitude lately, as opposed to my first exposure to him, are becoming quite the turn off.  In this volume, there were somevery glaring examples of either contradiction, strict unfairness, and at times, ego...despite Dyer's commitment against the ego.  I also found it very repetative, but I realize he warns of that early on. However just because something is acknowledged, does not mean it should be accepted.  The following items bothered me the most, and I would be interested to learn if others readers agree with these bothersome items.  -The oft mentioned assumption that he is personally the reincarnated spirit of St. Francis of Asissi.  -He is not very supportive of his friends. To him it seems that to even be in the presence of an unhappy person insults him. His reason being that since life is perfect and nothing wrong EVER happens to us, being unhappy or scared of something is simply a low energy, and one thathe is unwilling to stand inthe presence of. He even mentions a story of a good friend of his who started to be worried about the leaness of his business. He had legitimate concerns about going under. Not thoughts of evil or suicide or anything, just some natural worry when the finances did not look good.  Dyer, in the book, tells us "just about the time I was no longer willing to be exposed to this sort of thing..." Meaning that in his perfect life, there are no accidents, and so, he did not want to be around his supposed friend, because being a little scared or worried is ungodlike. He ignores the fact that in order to help people, especially friends, you have to be in the midst of bad things sometimes. He often quotes Mother Teresa. Yet if shehad told all of those sick people to simply "think about what you were doing when you first became sick, and stop doing it!" she would not bethe saintwe recognize her as today.  -Secondly, multiple times in just about every chapter, he plugged one or more of his other books, books by colleagues, or books published by Hay House. It is allright to acknowledge your previous works, or those of others, but the frequency with which he does so in thisvolume is disingenuous at best. Product placement, at worst.  -I call one's attention to page 106 of the book. Dyer's "12 Step Program to Simplicity." Items 10 and 11.  Item 10 calls for us to "Eschew Debt" and to live within our means...not purchases or buying things we do not absolutley need, in order to live the life we agreed with God to havebefore we were born.  The very next item, number 11, instructs us to "forget about cash value." He proceeds, on the very same page, to tell us that we should not look at the dollar signs when we are "inspired" to do something like take a trip, eat a nice dinner out on the town, or be comfortable. How can one eschew debt, and yet ignore the dollar value of an item they are inspired to posess?  -Pages 110-113. The Ram Dass Story. This is among the more insulting parts of the book. He tells the story of one ofhis mentors, and reproduces a letter he has posted on his (Dyer) own website. In it, Dyer tells of how gentle and wonderful Dass hasbeen, and how important this "dear friend" has been throughouthis life, especially since coming to live in Maui in the twilight of his life.  Then, Dyer has the audacity to solicit you and I for money to help buy Dass his own house! In Maui!  This book "eschewing" the ideaof possesions, money, and doubting that the universe will take care of everything you ever could want, is asking us to pay for his mentor's housing conditions, simply because Dyer thinks he is "a wonderful man".  How about this...Dyer isso fond of "giving something of yourself everyday..." how about cutting into your millions of dollars and cutting a check for your hero to own his own house? You can afford it, I cannot. Or if you cannot swallow that, cut him a check large enough to coverhis moving expenses out of Maui (one of the most expensive places on earth to live), and to a location far more affordable. If what is said about Dass is true, he should be happy anywhere he can find to live. They arrogance of a millionaire asking for donations to save his "mentor" who lives just down the street from him was nearly enough to get me to stop reading the book right there.  Furthermore, the entire business bore little relevence to the rest of the chapter, which was ostensibly about "Faith Banishes all doubt".  Unless you can sucker the general public into buying your guru a home in Maui.  -The name dropping throughout the book. He studied with, worked with, talked to, helped the luggage problems of...fill in the blank with celebrity X. The encounter with Renee Zellwegger outlined on pages 144-146 (complete with photo copy of a note she gave him) is the most glaring example of this.   -His mentioning more of the great things he did "in spirit", such as throwing away a mashed up burger he saw on the floor of a McDonald's, page 150 or so. I love how picking up a burger being trampled is heroic, but heneeds ourhelp in paying for his guru's home....      My point is made. There are other things, but honstly, I do not feel like looking for the page number, as I would have to skim the book again.  I am finding Dyer to be more annoying as time goes on. By his own advice about annoying people, I should send himthoughts of love. I would do so, in proportion to how much this book annoyed me, but I also have a day job.   
 The product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam, they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1/2 inch.  We didn't even bother to blow the thing up, utter junk, returned for something cheaper and better put together (we hope). if I could give this a negative star rating I would. 
 I found little to no new information on tennis in this book.  Granted, I am a tennis fanatic, but I was hoping for some new tidbit or anecdote, neither of which I got 
 Recently I've been doing research on oral contraceptives and their hormonal basis and I picked up this book because I thought it might have something to tell me about how the pill worked. Of course the book has no such thing. The words "estriadol" and "progestin" the two main components of the pill are not even in the index. The book is a collection of anectodal complaints from women about their experiences with the pill without any basis in science or medicine. Seamen doesn't even talk about how the side effects reported could have been caused by the pill, she simply reports them as fact. There are interviews with laypeople, doctors, and psychologists but there are absolutely no references located in this book from peer reviewed scientific journals. She does describe some scientific studies but completely skews the results. Basically this book is unscientific, sensationalistic, and poorly written 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't "light reading" or entertaining at all. Be warne 
 The languages and images don't connect. We were given this as a gift because of the linguistic value, but instead the entire dvd doesn't offer it. The other dvds in this collection are great. This one failed to teach anything 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox!

 I don't know how I managed to see this gory splatterfest TWICE in college.It's a terrible movie (next to that other awful movie "Wild Wild West" which also stars Salma Hayek)  Quentin Tarantino&George Clooney play a pair of ne'er do wells who take a family hostage.They end up going to a strip joint filled with evil vampires...and battling them until dawn.Turns out that the strip joint is built on top of an Aztec temple,hence the bloodsucking strippers.  George Clooney managed to overcome this,as well as "Batman&Robin" to get into "Syriana"&"Good Night,and Good Luck." He's a talented actor;too bad he couldn't save this movie through sheer charm.When it comes to heists,he's better in "Ocean'e Eleven" as a dapper casino-robbing metrosexual.  Avoid this movie,unless you REALLY like gruesome,violent movies.. 
 Waste of money if you are not into the girl- girl thing- nearly every story has it.  And the ones that don't are worse.  terrible.  Bad writing 
 I thought this would be a good book until I read the paragraph telling kids not the set goals too high and keep expectations realistic.  I tossed it after that.  Shouldn't kids be settting high goals for themselves and working to achieve them?  Even if the goals seem unrealistic, should anyone really tell a kid his expectations are too high 
 I have never come across such blatant hostility towards Christianity  - and in a children's book to boot!  The research is inaccurate and the writing poor.  For example, the author writes about Prince Henry, "He was religious enough...." and then continues on to, yet again, put Christians in a tiny, mindless box.  What does it mean to be "religious enough"?  Don't make the same mistake I did by buying this book 
 These reviews are probably more interesting than the book. What's so interesting about them is that the reviewers don't seem to get that more than two-thirds of the country are now fully aware of Bush's utter incompetence as a leader. The "vast left-wing conspiracy" now consists of a 2/3 majority of the country. Apparently, 1 1/2 years wasn't enough time for a clear majority of voters to figure it all out. But nearly 3 1/2 years later, we all see. This book is a couple of years too late. Today it's utterly ridiculous to denounce a "conspiracy" to reveal the TRUTH 
 Why pay $34 when you can buy the magazine at a bookstore and order a subscription for $19.9 
 The problem with this book is that it takes a fairly simple approach to teaching writing, even though teaching writing is quite complicated and difficult.  Also, the book doesn't say enough about ESL writers or writers with dialects.  Finally, I couldn't find any discussion of the fact that writing skills in our schools have declined even as research in writing has increased.  Overall, I would say that this is a "feel-good" book that doesn't address the hard issues of writing instruction 
 Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all ("Bandages" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).   If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre. 
 This device has lots of problems.  The customer support was not very good either.  We had difficulty setting up the wifi access when we got it.  Customer support provided no help at all.  We finally figured it out on our own.  The software constantly freezes, often requiring rebooting.  The last straw was today when all of the applications disappeared from the desktop.  We'll take our refund and purchase a laptop 
 Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused.  Was it the same movie?  The martial arts were "ok" in this, but nothing I havent seen done better before.  The story-line  was.. ummm. well, nevermind.    Oh and did I mention the film doesnt end????  I mean I didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though.  I really wantedto like this movie... but the only good thing I can say is that some of the sub-titles are hilarious 
 I expected more from this book since it's from Baby Einstein, but the language in the book doesn't flow well. I like the thick, puffy pages that I can use to help teach my 3-month-old how to turn the pages, but the story isn't well-written. I also thought it was funny that the back of the book tells parents to imitate the sounds of the animals that the tadpole meets in the pond, yet the animals in the book are minnows, salamander, beaver and heron. I wish I knew what sound a salamander makes so that I could imitate it for my baby 
 This is a wistful collection of quotations garnered from a wide variety of artists, writers, politicians, &c who have contemplated or, at least made a side remark, on the nature of ennui. I got this book for free at a library sale, and honestly, I wouldn't pay that much more for it. I enjoy having it around just to flip through, particularly when suffering from ennui, but its utility is not much more. As with any book of quotations based on a theme, especially one as complex as ennui, it is hard to take the content too seriously because of the lack of context for each quotation--and without the context, it's hard to contemplate the nature of what's being said, which renders this book, more or less, a novelty item. 
 This direct to video "sequel" is actually more of a re-tread of the original 1998 guilty pleasure erotic thriller/film noir potboiler, and another of the countless, and pointless, direct to video sequels to come from Sony/Comlumbia/Tri-Star as of late (Cruel Intentions 2 & 3, Starship Troopers 2, shall I go on?).  Wild Things 2 focuses around a rich girl (Susan Ward) whose stepfather mysteriously dies, and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival (Son of the Beach's hot Leila Arcieri) who claims to be the man's true, biological daughter.  Naturally, just like in the original, there are plot twists aplenty, as learned by an insurance investigator (Isiah Washington, giving a somewhat inspired performance), and naturally, there are double crosses, murders, and a redux of the first film's threesome, only it's not as erotic as the original's.  Wild Things 2 isn't just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it's good points, it's a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate.  Is it worth seeing?  Depends how much you liked the first Wild Things, but for the rest of us, just watch the original and forget this ever happened 
 I thought this book was silly.  I didn't like how it was written.. 
 i didnt got the car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it. WRONG ITEM 
 There are a lot of names here, but very little information - only one sentence on my family, which I already knew.  I expected more information or at least a source to go to for more background.  OK for generic research  only for rare names 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 Apart from starring in a musical, this is probably the worst western Clint Eastwood has ever done in his career.  Although it tries to achieve a lofty theme of revenge and justice, it simply falls flat on its face with a flat screenplay, a  minimal script, and simply terrible acting.  This is the kind of film you want to drift through at 4:00 am on your TV set when you have nothing better to do.  A film in which a tumbleweed drifting on the desert floor in the high wind has more development than the story or the characters.  Clint Eastwood is a nameless drifter known simply "the Stranger" who happens to ride into the desolate town of Lagos.  Brutalized by a band of thugs, he returns to the town unrecognized to exact an obligation from the cowardly inhabitants who left him to be beaten and take revenge on his attackers. He obtains the help of a marginalized local dwarf (Billy Curtis) to rally the inhabitants and repaint the town red with the new name of "Hell."  "Hell" is what you will feel like as you plod through this boring film and its mundane plot.  The poor filming and simply atrocious acting by everyone involved will add to the feeling of infernal damnation.  I am a big Clint Eastwood fan but this western is simply bad and unworthy of either rental or purchase.  Clint simply has better things available to watch such as Leone's films, 'Hang 'Em High', "The Outlaw Josey Wales", etc.  You won't miss a thing by not watching this film 
 Does not fit Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized Collector's Edition 2 1/2-Quart Shallow Saucepan with Li 
 I found this book to be very limited in regard to content.  I was looking for more advanced techniques, or at least a more detailed study of actual methods for accomplishing what the title advertises.   The author could have presented the main points of this book on a few pages and saved us all the time required to read the filler material.  Just about any book you pick up about public speaking or personal communication contains the advice found here.  "Repeat the question - It gives you a few more seconds to think about your answer" is about as advanced as the info in this book gets 
 I'm giving this novel two stars for a clever idea and some good writing (though it could have been edited better).   I began reading with high hopes  (I liked the psychological insights into Dexter's "condition" and his childhood) but found the endless mid-section with gruesome "action" scenes and unrelentingly smart-ass (and often repetitive and redundant) inner dialogue tedious.  I flipped through the book to see how it would end (I rarely do that) because it just seemed to go on and on about one dismemberment after another...not  even very interesting, just the lopping off of limbs.  Ugh.  The worst part's the ending -   Dexter daydreaming about how great it will be to teach his fiancee's little boy -  an (apparently) budding psychopath like Dexter - the  "rules" of his murderous trade.  So Dexter will pass on to the kid what his own stepfather did: that it's O.K. to kill  if you just kill bad guys.  How very convenient and simple it would be if psychopaths really did think that way.  Then they would not murder their spouses, children, or the victims they hunt down  and slaughter in cold blood, just for kicks. There's going to be a TV series based on these father-son "bonding" stories?  It's basically a one-note black humor joke that should go no further than  two clever, disturbing novels. I say Deep-Six Deadly Dexter before an audience of young people can be indoctrinated into this rather nasty version of the Old Boys' Club 
 I loved the Sunday Wife.  The book had a great concept however we were lead into little clues along the way of different relationships and twists and turns...and yet nothing went further.  The focus ended up on the one SSG who got cancer and died.  The end left me very empty 
 Bringing out some sort of "Tribute to Paris Hilton" song by simply covering an old song and giving a ragga feel to it - is SIMPLY BORING. So far Stefani did not convince me as a solo artist. it's all high marketin 
 At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well. 
 I read the first 20 pages of this snorer and couldn't continue. NOTHING happens! Why would I consider reading on? What's the first rule of writing a compelling novel? GRAB THE READER ON THE FIRST PAGE! This book never did. I'm not sure how people can rave about the great writing - it just isn't there 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 As a longtime Danielle Steel reader, I was excited that she finally wrote about a non Christian character.  I should have saved my excitement.  Almost everything that has to do with anything Jewish in this book is wrong.  You don't sit shiva for one night, you sit for one week.  Her brother would have never made the reference to getting leave "at Christmas".  Yom Kippur is not on the same day each year.  There was no mention of Shabbos until the very end when Amadea tried it from reading a book.  Shabbos is the most important holiday there is and it happens every week.  Everything leads up to it.  Mom would have been preparing the dinner, baking the challah, etc.  The older kids, even after being away from their parents for years, could have told HER how to keep Shabbos and say the blessings.  She goes to her mothers funeral and says the Our Father, then 4 years later she says kaddish for her family.  There is not a yiddish word or phrase in the entire book.  I could go on and on.  In terms of research, like Silent Honor, this one needed much more than it was given.  
 It is not good as  a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant . Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching "I like to play games" , its a much better soft-porn movie.  
 This is yet another compendium of contributed works.  While this book isn't awful enough for one star, it isn't good enough for three.  I woudl have felt more neutral if it said anything new or anything that you can't get from the fixed income research group of an investment bank or trading house for free, such as one right here in Greenwich 
 I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.  I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
 At first glance, Michael Alan Weiner seems like an improbable candidate to be America's angriest, most vicious conservative radio host. Born 60 years ago in the Bronx, Weiner has lived in Northern California for most of his adult life, making a living as an herbalist and nutritionist. He communed with Fijian traditional healers, got married in a rain forest and studied ethno-medicine at the University of California at Berkeley. He swam naked with Allen Ginsberg, dreamed of being the next Lenny Bruce and wrote a rambling novel about a half-mad alter ego. His son's middle name is Goldencloud. For years, he made a name cranking out a pile of books on alternative medicine, recommending bizarre remedies such as using vitamin C to stop AIDS and kicking cocaine with coffee enemas.   These days, Weiner's more interested in purging the body politic. Using the pseudonym Michael Savage, he's launched a one-man mission to save America from its enemies at home and abroad, which on any given day includes liberals, gays, academics, the homeless, the Clintons, immigrants, feminists, CNN, the American Civil Liberties Union, Muslims and other minorities. Broadcasting three hours a day, five afternoons a week, from a rented studio in downtown San Francisco, he gives voice to the right wing's darkest fantasies. He muses about launching preemptive nuclear strikes on the Middle East ("I wish to God the hatches were open and the missiles were flying!"), suggests gunning down illegal immigrants ("If we had a government, we'd blow them out of the desert with airplanes!"), dreams of dispatching with "commies, pinkos and perverts" and other undesirables ("I say round them up and hang 'em high!") and even paraphrases a remark attributed to Nazi leader Hermann Goering ("When I hear someone's in the civil rights business, I oil up my AR-15!")   Woe be unto those who label him racist, sexist or homophobic -- or even worse, threaten his livelihood. When an Oregon group started a boycott of his advertisers last summer, he became downright apoplectic. "I'm more powerful than you are, you little hateful nothings!" he screeched, before intoning darkly in his trademark New-Yawk accent: "I'm gonna warn you again: If you harm me -- and I pray that no harm comes to you -- but I can't guarantee that it won't." Just last week, Savage fumed about the "brownshirt groups" who dare to criticize him: "You stinking rats who hide in the sewers! ... You think I'm going to roll over like a pussy? You're wrong!"   Such vitriolic ranting is over the top, even by the ever-declining standards of talk-radio decorum. Yet, in this time of war fever and hyperpatriotism, inflammatory rhetoric draws conservative ditto-heads and liberal rubberneckers alike, and that translates into big ratings. Since launching "The Savage Nation" on San Francisco's KSFO 560 AM more than eight years ago, Savage has gone from being just another right-winger with a big mouth, a hyperinflated ego and a sizable chip on his shoulder to becoming the nation's fifth most-popular talk-radio personality, a host with enough leverage to land Vice President Dick Cheney as a guest. His book, "The Savage Nation: Saving America From the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture," has been perched at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for over a month, and now he's slated to get his own program on MSNBC.   Michael Weiner's long and circuitous road has taken him from being a scientist and entrepreneur, through stints as a hipster, novelist and aspiring comedian, to becoming the personification of straight white male rage. Today he likes to play up his unconventional career path, to an extent. He's the kind of guy who never lets anyone forget he has a Ph.D. His Web site reminds visitors that he is a "World Famous Herbal Expert" and the author of 18 books. But just as his gap-toothed grin has been replaced by a row of airbrushed pearly whites on the front cover of his new book, he gives his audience a whitewashed version of his past. The real story is far more interesting, not just for its ironies and contradictions, but for the often disturbing clues it provides about the man now so well known as Michael Savage. He's gone through at least one political makeover. He's turned on old friends, or they've turned on him. If his semi-autobiographical novel is any guide to his own life, he's keeping a few skeletons in his closet.   In the end, the picture that emerges from his books, from interviews with past and current associates, and from his radio show is that "The Savage Nation" is just the latest undertaking of a man who's spent his life trying to get the world to notice him.   Savage's office said he was too busy preparing for his TV show to be interviewed for this article. Earlier interview requests by phone and e-mail prompted an irritated phone call from a woman named Janet, who announced that Savage would not speak with me. Asked if she was his wife -- who happens to be named Janet -- she said she was not. "I am not affiliated with him," she insisted. "I'm just a fan." After a few minutes of testy back and forth, she suggested that it would be unfortunate if my e-mail address and phone number were somehow posted across the Internet.   Savage has come a long way since he emceed school assemblies at P.S. 42 in the Bronx. His father, a Russian Jewish immigrant, made a living selling antique bronzes on Orchard Street. An imposing figure who died of a heart attack in the early 1970s, he is the frequent subject of his son's on-air stories. Speaking at a convention sponsored by the trade magazine Radio & Records in March 2001, Savage recalled getting his first lesson in politics -- and cynicism -- from his dad. "[H]e explained politics to me very clearly. He said, 'You see, this is how the world works ... In this beautiful country of ours there are two bands of thieves: the Republicans and the Democrats.'"   Though Savage waxes nostalgic about such father-and-son moments, it appears that his parents were no Ozzie and Harriet. "I was raised on neglect, anger, and hate," he writes in "The Savage Nation." But growing up with little parental approval or praise was a good thing, he says. "Frankly, that's why I'm driven the way I am."   Savage, who now decries "propaganda about America being the Land of Immigrants," isn't ashamed of his own immigrant parents. However, his Jewish upbringing is strictly taboo. And he often makes Joseph Lieberman, Barbra Streisand and Larry King the butt of stale ethnic jokes. Brad Kava, radio columnist for the San Jose Mercury News and a longtime Savage critic, thinks Savage's ambivalence toward Jews is a misguided attempt to pander to conservative Christians. "He's Jewish, but he always acts like he's Christian," he says. In his book "The Savage Nation," for example, he complains of an anti-Christian bias in America. When Kava, who is Jewish, "outed" Savage several years ago, Savage reported him to the Anti-Defamation League. Dr. Robert F. Cathcart, a longtime friend of the talk-show star, speculated in a telephone interview that Savage says little about his background so that he appears more "neutral" when he discusses Israel or religious topics.   Everyone who has ever known Michael Weiner seems to agree that he has always been a big talker. One of his classmates from Jamaica High School in Queens, which Weiner graduated from in 1959, recalls him as a garrulous character: "He was on the short side, and he was intense -- a fast talker, and always hatching some scheme or other." "The fellow I knew was a natural comic and as reliable as a clock," remembers another classmate, who says the teenage Weiner was "non-political." His yearbook page notes his participation in the Chemistry Lab Squad, school government, and the Rifle Squad, presaging his interest in science, politics and firearms.   Weiner was also something of a dreamer, and he hoped to follow in the footsteps of his hero, the naturalist Charles Darwin. After getting a biology degree from Queens College, he went as far west -- and as far from home -- as possible, winding up in Oahu, Hawaii, where he earned master's degrees in anthropology and botany from the University of Hawaii. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, he traveled to Tonga, Fiji and other South Pacific island nations to study traditional herbal medicine. His new wife, Janet, and their young son, Russell Goldencloud, often accompanied him on his travels. Local healers warmly welcomed him, and he became passionately convinced that their expertise could be used to cure modern ailments. Thus began a quest to salvage-- not savage-- this "ethnic wisdom" before Western influences destroyed it. His research on the sedative kava kava and other Fijian medicinal plants served as the basis for his doctoral work at U.C. Berkeley. His 1978 dissertation, on file in the U.C. Berkeley library, shows his degree was in nutritional ethnomedicine. However, the bio in the back of Savage's book and on his Web site says it was in epidemiology and nutrition science.   In 1974, Weiner moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. His family first settled in Fairfax, a sleepy town in Marin County that Michael Savage would lambaste three decades later as "un-Fairfax," hometown of "Taliban Rat Boy" John Walker Lindh. From there, he started making trips into San Francisco to hang around the North Beach literary scene. According to Stephen Schwartz, who was then a left-wing activist and writer, Weiner carried an unusual letter of introduction. "He had met Allen Ginsberg in Fiji," he recalls. "He had this photograph of himself swimming naked with Ginsberg." Poet and biographer Neeli Cherkovski says Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the owner of City Lights Bookstore, introduced him to Savage in 1976. "All I knew was that he was this hip guy who'd been traveling in the South Seas, finding ways to use tropical plants to help end diseases," he recalls. The two became friends. "We had a lot of fun times. He's very smart, intelligent and very lively," says Cherkovski, who is now writer-in-residence at San Francisco's New College. Weiner told Cherkovski that he dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce and they talked of doing a comedy routine together.   But he didn't make the big splash he had hoped for. Schwartz says Weiner's increasingly bizarre behavior eventually alienated him from the North Beach crowd. "After he had been there a while, his personality began to change. He became much more aggressive. He would collar you and demand that you eat with him, listen to him," he says. According to Schwartz, Weiner openly carried a gun and made public scenes when he ran into his former friends and acquaintances. "He would come into Cafe Trieste and start yelling at me that I was a nobody and he was a somebody."   Today, Savage still has few kind words for his old lefty literary friends. In "The Savage Nation," he writes off City Lights as "that once-famous communist bookstore" and rips into an unnamed beat poet, calling him "latrine slime." "Now he just screams at us in the streets," sighs Ferlinghetti, who once went to Hawaii with Weiner and his family. He views Weiner's reincarnation as Michael Savage as "total opportunism," the crowning achievement of someone who was "always looking to make a fast buck" and "always trying to think up new schemes to get famous."   Weiner did have a knack for combining the promise of herbal medicine with good old-fashioned hucksterism. From his home, he started vanity projects such as the Fund for Ethnic Medicine and the Alzheimer's Research Institute, which he plugged on his book jackets and in letters to the New York Times. He concocted feel-good beverages like Tea of Life and Herbal-Seltzer and sold a line of herbal supplements from a Web site called Herbs That Heal. Visitors to the now-defunct site were welcomed with photographs of Weiner collecting herbs in the South Pacific, soulfully soaking in the culture of what Michael Savage belittles as the "turd world." The 1992 edition of "The Herbal Bible," published by his wife's imprint, Quantum Books, modestly noted that its author was "credited with starting the herbal revolution."   He was also a prolific writer, churning out 18 titles in 20 years. "[D]on't assume for a minute that they were junk books and marginally published," he snaps in "The Savage Nation." "They weren't. They were top of the line. They were the Rolls-Royce of the field." "Earth Medicine -- Earth Foods" and "Weiner's Herbal" are well-respected references and are still cited widely on herbal and homeopathic Web sites. Most of his books, with their glorified lists of plants and their properties, are about as dry as a handful of powdered dogwood root (which, according to Weiner, makes a good tonic for treating fevers). But buried in the details is a sprinkling of flaky affirmations and kooky assertions.   For example, in "Plant a Tree: a Guide to Regreening America," Weiner wrote dreamily about our "plant allies" and suggested that every state appoint its own "tree czar." "Dictators seem to like trees," he ruminated. "Who knows what a benevolent, nature-loving tyrant might do for the retreeing of America?" In "The Way of the Skeptical Nutritionist," he ventured that a person's ideal diet should be determined by his or her ethnicity. "Getting Off Cocaine: 30 Days to Freedom" promised blow addicts "an alternative plan for getting 'high' -- legally and naturally!" The treatment involved ingesting a daily cocktail of Sudafed, vitamins C and E, and amino acids, as well as self-administering the occasional coffee enema. "Use a good quality coffee," Weiner advised. "Not decaffeinated or instant."   Michael Savage's homophobic rants against what he calls "anal rights" were foreshadowed by the 1986 book "Maximum Immunity." In it, Weiner glommed onto some of the wilder ideas about AIDS that were circulating at the time. He called for mandatory nationwide AIDS testing and suggested using massive doses of vitamin C to slow down and even reverse the disease's progress. When he was done suggesting cures, he looked for scapegoats. He demanded that gays "accept the blame" for the rise of AIDS, then grumbled, "Those who practice orgiastic sex, with many partners, and use street drugs are not likely to respond to reason."   "Maximum Immunity" also hinted that its author was dealing with some heavy issues of his own. In one passage, Weiner wrote about his decision to take up jogging so that he might avoid his father's untimely fate. Everything went well until he started hearing things. "An inner 'voice' began to demand, 'Stop ... I can't take this anymore.'" he wrote. Fearing a "nervous collapse," Weiner traded his running shoes for a bike and soothed his jangled nerves by curling up on the sofa with a mug of passionflower herbal tea and ingesting "megadoses" of vitamins. Feeling much better, he concluded: "I learned to calm the inner debate that had threatened to drown me in madness!"   Such extreme mood swings are regular occurrences on "The Savage Nation." Even the phrase "I can't take this anymore!" (usually shouted at full volume) has become a Savage catchphrase. James Hilliard, who produced "The Savage Nation" at KSFO for nearly three years in the late 1990s, says that talk radio provided Savage with an outlet for his unpredictable temperament. As he recalls, "The show was really driven by Michael's mood. At times, he could be very quiet, mellow, low-key, and then be a maniac on the air."   This maniacal tendency, and the roiling emotions that fueled it, were laid bare in "Vital Signs," Michael Weiner's first and only book of fiction, published in 1983. A collection of confessional, stream-of-consciousness stories, it follows the exploits of Samuel Trueblood, who just happens to be a 40-ish New York Jew, an herbalist and writer with a tumultuous personal life, a substantial assortment of inner demons and a bit of a Napoleon complex. "I am physically not tall, but my eyes burn with fire," he states. "Two black fires of Hell." Trueblood narrates a series of misadventures, from procuring an illegal backroom abortion for his fiance to beating the stuffing out of an abusive cop.   Trueblood describes his life as one long search for inner peace. He blames much of his discontent on his "childhood beneath tyranny," during which he was cowed by his bullying father. Trueblood describes how his father mocked him with "brutal jokes and chides, 'gentle' kidding: 'You're not a fag, are you Sam?' the little man would say each time the boy dared wear a colorful shirt or flashy trousers." Unable to shake his dead father's disapproving influence, the adult Samuel is tortured by feelings of weakness and inadequacy. "I am filled with fears," he admits, "nearly all the time feeling I am about to become totally insane."   Even after moving to mellow Marin County, becoming a successful herbalist and starting a family, Trueblood remains plagued by his "underlying sadness." Not even trusty passionfruit tea can bring him off this bummer. In one passage, he almost loses it in front of his wife and two young children:   "Inner voice screaming at me for years, first rational, then crazy, telling me to do mad things. Every form of relief tried, painting, psychotherapy, running, diet, vitamins, etc., etc. Almost uncontrollable now. Impulses to stab children, strangers, wife, self with scissors."   Eventually, Trueblood seeks solace in chasing skirts. (Though he admits to being drawn to "masculine beauty," he confides that "I choose to override my desires for men when they swell in me, waiting out the passions like a storm, below decks.") While his wife stays home with the kids, he beds a young "cockswell" with a "dykish haircut" and skin "[s]ofter than that Northern Indian prostitute in Fiji whose covering was as soft as that of my own penis." And so it goes for another 50 pages.   No doubt the anti-abortion, anti-gay, pro-family Michael Savage would disapprove of such a perverted excuse for literature, with all its gratuitous references to illegal abortions, repressed homosexuality and shameless philandering. But it's impossible not to notice the similarity between Trueblood, the tormented seeker, and Savage, a man whose "inner voice" precipitated an existential crisis over jogging. Neeli Cherkovski says that the chapter in "Vital Signs" about Trueblood's father is based on Weiner's own life, recalling that he went with the author back to the Bronx to see the site of his father's store. But Cherkovski won't speculate about the rest. "I think he [Weiner] is a person who had a lot of wild experiences," Cherkovski says. "He tested a lot of waters." Even the book's dedication, to Weiner's wife, suggests that he wasn't making everything up: "Who would listen to such tales and live with he who lived them but she, the unshakably faithful Janet."   For most of the 1970s and 1980s, Weiner focused on curing people's illnesses, not society's ills. "For 10 or 15 years, I was the revered herbal doctor," he recollected at the Radio & Records convention. "I was Mr. Nice Guy Nutritionist. Nobody knew my politics. I was talking about healing and I'd go to health food conventions and I'd give speeches about vitamins and herbs. Nobody ever saw this as controversial ... They liked me!"   But beneath the surface, Weiner was becoming more and more conservative. Stephen Schwartz, who went from being a self-described Trotskyite to neoconservative and is now senior policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, says that Weiner was a "typical left liberal" in the 1970s. Neeli Cherkovski, who is gay, notes that Weiner was not homophobic when they first met. However, he says Weiner's shift rightward coincided with his increasing aversion to gay activism. Robert Cathcart, who's been close to Weiner since the mid-1980s, says he's always known his friend as an outspoken conservative, at least in private.   Since Weiner's conservative leanings took a hard right turn, he's complained that he was held back because of his race, gender and political beliefs. He currently gripes that no institute of higher education would hire him, despite his qualifications. "I discovered I could not gain a professorship even after applying many times," he writes in "The Savage Nation." "My crime? I was a white male." The rsum he has presented over the years tells another story. On air, he's mentioned that he was once affiliated with Harvard. On the back of his books, he has boasted of being a faculty member at U.C. Santa Cruz, a visiting scholar at the Hebrew University School of Pharmacy and a senior research fellow at the University of Heath Sciences at Chicago Medical School. He's also claimed to have done "important research" for the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. Not bad for someone who's been blacklisted from the ivory tower.   The last straw apparently came in 1994, when publishers rejected Weiner's latest manuscript, "Immigrants and Epidemics," which contended that infectious diseases such as T.B. were being brought into the U.S. by Southeast Asian immigrants. Fed up, Weiner rented a recording studio in Sausalito and produced a mock talk show with his wife and a couple of buddies playing callers. Michael Savage was born.   In his new job, Savage employed all the self-promotional tricks he had picked up while going from Charles Darwin wannabe to world-famous herbal expert. In early 1996, he applied to become dean of the U.C. Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. Unable to appreciate the journalistic qualities of Savage's radio program or his 18 books, his alma mater denied him an interview, instead hiring China scholar and journalist Orville Schell. Savage sued Berkeley with the help of a conservative legal fund started by David Horowitz (who wrote approvingly of the case in Salon), accusing it of discriminating against a conservative in favor of a man he has called a "front for the communist Chinese mafia." The case never went to trial. During the run-up to the 2000 election, Savage laid claim to the phrase "compassionate conservative," and said he planned to sue George W. Bush for intellectual property theft. Like many of Savage's threats of imminent litigation, this one soon faded away. But sure enough, he had self-published a book called "The Compassionate Conservative Speaks" in 1995 and, ever the savvy businessman, had trademarked the term in 1998.   Even Savage's two kids were swept up in his relentless drive for publicity. His Web site advertised Rockstar, a liver-cleansing beverage marketed by his son that enables its drinkers to "party like a rock star." Last spring, Savage told his listeners about a third-grade teacher in San Diego, Calif., who had saved a child from choking, and demanded that the state school superintendent give her an official commendation. "If she was a minority teacher and picked up a paper clip on the floor, then a commendation would be in order," he sniped. He neglected to mention that the "hero teacher," Rebecca Lin Yops, was in fact his daughter, who had changed her last name after her recent marriage.   Armed with his natural loquaciousness and a kill button, Savage's love affair with the sound of his own voice deepened. Obsequious fans obliged him by calling him "Doctor Savage," prompting him to expound his theories on how gays and immigrants spread disease and were corrupting the nation. "It's the greatest revenge there is, having a talk show," he crowed in "The Compassionate Conservative Speaks." And as his rhetoric became ever more grandiose and outrageous, his ratings -- and political clout -- grew. "The Savage Nation" became the Bay Area's No. 1 drive-time radio program. Savage lunched with Democratic San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and started landing big-name conservative guests such as Benjamin Netanyahu and Vice President Dick Cheney, who, apparently unaware of the show's usual host-centered format, commended Savage for "providing a forum where we can have a good discussion."   Looking for a way to leverage his newfound influence, Savage founded the Paul Revere Society, a political club whose goals have included the imprisonment of antiwar activists for sedition, loyalty oaths for immigrants and the eventual establishment of "a haven for compassionate conservatives" called "Revere-Town." A fee of $40 gets new members a Savage Nation baseball cap and an anti-affirmative action pamphlet called "The Death of the White Male." There's also the promise that one day they might get to meet the founder and executive director in person. But given Savage's reclusiveness, they may have to wait a while. The group's last major event took place in November 2000, when it held its fifth annual "Compassionate Conservative Convention" in San Rafael, not far from Savage's home. Since then, Savage made himself available to fans only at dinner parties, and only after they forked over more than a hundred bucks. Meanwhile, according to papers filed with the IRS, this nonprofit "educational organization" took in over $150,000 in donations in 2001 and expects to take in $250,000 this year.   The success of "The Savage Nation" and its spinoffs is the culmination of a lifelong quest for attention, fame and money. And that raises the question of whether Michael Savage is just a persona created to milk conservatives and taunt liberals. Robert Cathcart thinks his old friend intentionally exaggerates his politics and personality to get a rise out of his audience. "It's showmanship," he says. "He makes enemies of everybody. He doesn't believe half the stuff he says. On air, he's the ultimate type-A personality, but he quiets down at home." Former "Savage Nation" producer James Hilliard concurs. "I think Michael does have an excellent sense of putting on a show," he says. "I think he learned or was told at an early point that this is an entertainment medium, and he thought of himself as an entertainer."   However, as Savage rips into another hapless caller or gets exercised about the latest liberal atrocity, it often feels like he's crossed the line between public shtick and personal catharsis. On the air, he lets everything hang out, truly living up to the warning of "psychological nudity" advertised at the beginning of every show. This is what makes "The Savage Nation" so simultaneously maddening and fascinating -- as Savage heads over the brink one more time, you have to wonder whether someday he'll go over for good. Cathcart and Hilliard are right when they say the show is not just about politics. But it's not just about entertainment, either. It is about one man grappling with his ambitions and fears while America listens. For Michael Weiner, talk radio is the ultimate talking cure.   
 This item is absolutely worthless, don't waste your time! I'm returning mine to Target tomorrow.   There are laws against false advertising, I don't know why they're not enforced.  I will never buy ANYTHING made by Belkin again.   
 This is a big disappointment! Pictures are not all on one page. The animals are split in half because of this. What a dumb idea!! Save your money. This book isn't worth half of what I paid 
 This book for me has two faces, for some time, I enjoyed it like a drug, and then it was difficult for me to even open it... The thing is, for me, when Strieber tells his story, it's like the best book I've ever read, but when he pretends to be some scientist or else, and he tries to look so objectif, it just gets pathetic, unbearable...  However, I think people should read the book, but really skip some parts because some have just no sense.. 
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 The information contained in this book can be found in 5min on any search engine. 
 Almost immediately after I received this never-used pen, I noticed that the ink does not dispense evenly.  Often, it does not write on any surface.  After I scratch the pen tip wildly for ~5 seconds, it starts to write again.  I've thrown it away because it is too inconvenient for use.  However, it is very cheap, so maybe it's okay for someone who doesn't need to use a tiny pen too often 
 Before I right this review, I'm going to take a few moments just to calm down to avoid telling you of the idiocy of this book in all capital letters.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There. I think I'm ready.  The River Between Us is awful. No element of the story is particularly captivating. I struggled through the story, re-reading passages or even entire chapters just to get the gist of what was going on.  Peck's decision to tell what might have been an interesting story from an unimportant character's point of view proved fatal. The book may have gained an extra star if the story had been told from Delphine's point of view, or even Cass'. Any interesting aspect of the story is squashed flat by irrelevant detail.   I read the book because it was a nominee in my local library's book award contest. I stumbled through it blindly, actually counting down the pages to the end. This book is not worth a read.   If you are looking for a better piece of historical fiction to read, allow me to recommend "A Northern Light," by Jennifer Donnelly. 
 I ordered a human resource book and it took 9 day when you said 3-5 business days. I thought i was getting a hardback book but when i got it..it was paperback with small print and black and white pages. I have sold books via Amazon but this is the first time buying and it was very disappointing 
 I am glad I rented this DVD.  It actually is not even worth the rental price. It is that unfunny.  I think her impressions are horribly annoying.  She sounds bitter and evil rather goofy and funny.  I would be surprised if a laugh track wasn't used. The camera never focused once on the audience. So who knows if they were really laughing.  I think she is unattractive and that adds insult to injury.  She think she is all that and a bowl of soy sauce but she isn't.  Her only funny impression was when she was making fun of her asian parents.  Other than that the best way to describe her unorignal comedy style is that it is comprised of generic and vulgar anecdotes that are more annoying to hear than funny.  I think after her shows she is laughing at her audience back stage because she is managing to get away with telling awful jokes and stories and making it huge. She has the last laugh.   
 As I read these other reviews I'm curious if they were reading the same book that I read.  I gave it 2 stars only because I have read worse books.  That is not to say that the information in the book is not interesting, or heartfelt, but I just feel poorly written.   Dirlam repeats herself in many useless issues, such as the numerous times that she metions the reavealing dress of the russian girls.  The book is also a bit scattered, it did not flow well.  I would recomend against purchasing this book, rather for an excellent book on siberia read Colin Thurbron's "In Siberia" it will delight and amaze you 
 This is a fine series so when I began this volume I had hopes that it would be of the same standard as the others.  Ms. Haney has a genuine gift in giving readers the "texture" of everyday life in imperial Rome (at the time of Vespasian and Titus in this one).  The dialogue and the characters are both engaging.  So what went wrong?  A young girl appears to speak with Falco believing someone in her family wants to kill her.  And away we go, on and on and on!  I was weary by the time I got to the rather flat conclusion and felt that a good editing would have been most helpful; the length of this book (326 pages) really cannot support so thin a story.  I was left wondering what had happened and if somehow I had missed something as there was so little going on 
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 These authors, and this book (in an earlier edition) were the first wave of today's spam onlsaught.  If you need immigration information, please look elsewhere.  If you -really- want this book, please buy the used copy.  In the perusing of it that I've done, I found it to be not entirely uninformative, but I certainly wouldn't give it accolades, and, given it (and its authors') background, I wouldn't pay money for it if you held a gun to my head.  Go ahead: type "Canter and Siebel" into Google, and see what you get 
 This book is probably a better read in the paper version.  Sandra Burr's male voices are somewhat shrill and detract from the story.  Not my favorite narrator.  Susan Ericsen's reading of Coulter's The Maze was better. 
    Zlata's Diary was very disappointing because she kept saying the same thing over and over and over again. The ending was the same as the beginning. All Zlata basically said was, "Oh no the first day there was no water or electricity!" Then the next day she would say "Yay it's back on!"    Again, I think that there could have been a little bit more variety of things that happened. I think that if there was it would have been a much better book. 
 If you are familiar with putting on makeup you don't need this book at all. Very Basic. I would recommend to those who are completely in the dark about applying makeup 
 The professionals in the law field in this book aren't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become.  I understand not everyone becomes a six-figure-paid lawyer right out of law school, but this book is ridiculous.  It shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk?  Give me a break 
 This book has totally outraged me. Sure, the suggestions for talking to your baby as a person and explaining what you are going to do are great...but most of us do that anyway. Gerber's ideas (and the way she relates them) are scientifically unfounded. She claims that taking your baby for a walk is a "frenetic" way of parenting, and completely misses the point of safe and healthy "babywearing". Her ideas about giving infants "space" simply don't match up with infant development, and the examples she cites in the book are almost cultish comments by parents describing how they ignore their own instincts and recount what "Magda says" and how they "trust Magda". If you want a book that gives hard evidence and cites sources try "Our Babies, Ourselves: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent. 
 I used to be a huge Brian Tracy fan.  I always thought of this book as the "master list" of advice because it's so condensed, it has everything you'll ever need to succeed.  Yeah right.  This book is so impractical that it's basically useless.  Tracy quotes list after list.  Some lists actually have sublists!!!!  What the hell.  Tracy will start talking about the three different types of "personal goals" and you'll forget that you're still inside the 7 item list of individual goals  (just an example, I don't recall if those numbers are right, but you get the idea).  On top of that, the advice doesn't really work for me.  Visualizing, Self-Hypnosis, Writing down goals, come on.  Is this realistic?  Is this really what successful people have done to make it?  I kindof doubt it.   I've started reading Robert Ringer.  He's to the point with no BS.  Tracy is not getting another dime from me 
 I love lamb of god there 1 of my favs. i have all their albums and this was the last 1 i needed. when i 1st listended to it i had to check in the inside of the cd to see if this really was lamb of god. it was total garbage. this cd was before LOG developed their brutal thrash metal sound but in this cd it is just crap. randy sounds nothin like he does in any other LOG cds and trust me it doesnt sound good. the guitarists arent up 2 par either but as usual chris adler always plays great drums but it couldnt save this album. i broke this cd w/ a hammer it was that bad. I suggest for new listeners of LOG pick up As the palaces burn and ashes of the wake then get New American Gospel but really stay away from this one. LOG is not even close to being fully developed in this albu 
 The book starts out well enough when banker Ben Hartman, in Switzerland on business, runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him.  Then through a series of accidental discoveries, narrow escapes, and unbelievable coincidences, Hartman learns that practically everybody he knows, and everyone new he meets, is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination. When you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is, it seems like something only Austin Powers' nemesis Dr. Evil could have pulled off.  Without giving too much away - I have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain's heavily-guarded, secret mountain lair.  And of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero.  Yeah baby, yeah 
 Go figure. I picked this head because it seemed to be a significant size, and have a lot of silky-looking hair, real lashes, and fun (rather than tacky) features and make-up being a fairy rather than a teen. However, her hair is very fine and is actually glued together in parts to retain her curls. It is painful to watch my three year old twins struggle to get the included brush through her hair. Impossible. I tried to give it a once-over to help them out, but it tears and ends up looking frizzy and uneven -- I had to re-trim the bottom. The head also tips over easily when you try working with her hair. A ridiculous waste of money 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 I don't own this clock, but I do own one of it's sister clocks, the Tambour Style Mantel Clock, and it did not change for DST now that the date has changed.  Even though I've owned my clock for all of a month and a half, River City Cuckoo Clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect.  Since I would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics, I would be very wary about buying this clock 
 Many other people have covered the historical facets of the book well. It is truly one of the mysteries of history that are "lost in the mists of time!" But my main complaint is they both seem to have made up their minds first, like a lot of academics do & then did their "research" to "prove" what they already knew to be true! There is NO evidence whatsoever that I have read that the Russian Army destroyed the Amber Room, either deliberately as they suggest or even accidentally. But since we will never really know...  
 This so called game has a very good story and plot. It keeps your attention, by making you want to see what happens next. However, the gameplay could not satisfy an 8 year old. Why you ask? Because there is none. You watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do. There is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need. Oooooh. there are multple endings. Whoopee! You still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing. Out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time, I would estimate that I only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes. This makes for a good movie but don't buy it if you actually like to PLAY your games instead of watch them 
 I have a Marantz CD recorder DR 6000. A previous generation of Memorex Music CD-R worked fine (White with purple lettering and blue recording surface) This new generation will not be read by this recorder. The recorder could not initialize and gave an disc error with several I tried.  It Worked fine with some new SONY CDRs. 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 Save your money, but more than that, save your time.  Joshi seems to be channeling Dorothy Parker in his vicious "critiques" of modern horror writers.  He doesn't just keep his vitriol for the writers either--there's plenty of contempt for the "uneducated" readers.  Joshi is apparently the embodiment of "those who can't" gripe about those who do.  Check this guy's credits.  He hasn't done anything beyond editing and deconstructing.  This book is mean-spirited, off-base and laughably pompous.  This guy needs to remove the stick 
 This is a dumb boring movie. I actually think this movie would be better to watch in 2d than 3d. The 3d in this movie sucks badly, and in order to really appreciate the campiness of the bad acting, direction, characters, and storyline-- one must not be waiting in eager anticipation for 3d scenes that simply do not deliver.   If you are looking for good 3d--PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. THESE "REVIEWERS" WHO REVIEW THIS MOVIE EITHER HAVE AN AFFILIATION WITH THE STUDIO THAT RELEASED IT OR SIMPLY HAVE NOT REALLY EXPERIENCED ANY GOOD 3D MOVIES AND ARE JUST REVIEWING OUT OF IGNORANCE.   The field sequential in this movie is horrible, due mostly to the fact that so much of the movie takes place indoors- inside small cramped looking rooms that do not offer up any depth of field!! I dont care if the entire movie is shot in field sequential......if there is no depth to the picture...then there is no REAL 3D!  If you are looking for BEYOND EXCELLENT 3d, then get yourself a copy of "Alien Adventure", "Encounter in the Third Dimension", or "The Haunted Castle". I have reviews of all these movies movies in my profile.....  I love horror, I love 3D, and I love cult and B movies but this movie just could NOT hold my interest for long.  I have stopped and started it 3 times since I have received it, and have yet to finish the end of the movie.   Again.....maybe in 2d--but stay away from the lousy 3D version.  It downright sucks

 Let me say at the start, I'm a big fan of Jayne Ann Krentz. I read all her books, under all her pseudonyms, and love 99.9% of her work.  From Krentz, I usually expect quirky heroines and endearing heros. Though they may spar at first, it's usually a fair give and take between the two, and a genuine affection quickly builds. It would seem the characters bring out the best in each other, and we love it when they're together. I usually smile a lot when I read a Krentz book, and I miss the characters when I finish.  Sweet Fortune must have been written by Krentz's evil twin. There is nothing endearing about "Hatch", our business-driven hero with no sense of humor and no warmth. And there are no witty verbal exchanges between the two. Our heroine, "Jessie", endures put-down after put-down without ever coming out on top, and seems to apologize on nearly every page. Hatch's character is always right, and unpleasantly smug. When Jessie inquires about his previous marriage, Hatch "puts up" with her questioning in a terribly condescending manner, because, we're led to believe, she is out-of-line in asking. And -- oh no! -- she apologizes for bringing it up. These are two people sleeping together, contemplating engagement, and he's behaving as if it's rude for her to ask if he had been married before. This is not a dark, brooding Duke from the Regency period that you might love to hate in the first few chapters. No, this is just a 20th/21st century know-it-all jerk that anyone with a shred of self-respect and an ounce of self-esteem would avoid.  I love a good dominant male in a romance novel... but the relationship in Sweet Fortune made me cringe. It was actually physically unpleasant to read this book.  Pick another Krentz book, that's my suggestion 
 I'm sad to say it looks like it is. We've reached the point where "serious" thinkers are claiming that we need to destroy our freedoms in order to save them.  Well, forgive me for pointing this out, since it should be obvious, but we got through World War I, World War II, and faced down a nuclear armed Soviet Union for 45 years or so, and we won all three, without throwing away all the things that make the United States different from everywhere else in the world. Arer we truly so skittish and cowardly that we're willing to give our government over to a misadministration of intellectually and emotionally stunted, sociopathic sleazebags because we're so desperately scared that some filthy, ragged, bearded, cave-dwelling losers might hurt us? Seriously, we need to get a grip on ourselves in this country.  While the terrorists have shown that they can kill 3000 of us at one go, and that is truly an atrocity, it is most emphatically NOT the threat that the Soviet Union, which could have obliterated millions of Americans in an hour, posed.  If we got through the Cold War without gutting our civil rights, shouldn't we be able to take on these pathetic terrorists without handing our freedom over to this appalling misadministration? And really, even if we were in such a desperate situation that giving up some of our rights might make it easier for the government to keep us safe from the cave-dwelling losers, has Bush, or anybody else in this misadministration done even ONE thing right so that we should even THINK of trusting them enough to willingly give up any rights at all? Posner is a fool who seems not to understand why America is special: it isn't because God saw fit to bless us no matter how we behave, just because we call ourselves "Americans", and it isn't because of some kind of Manifest Destiny; it's because of what a group of great and wise men built this country upon 219 years ago: trust in Americans, and the belief that we should ever struggle to be just a little better tomorrow than we are today. Posner would throw all that away because he's scared; or because he knows a lot of other Americans are scared, and he can use that fear to gather and hoard and wield ever more power over this country. He and his execrable deserves only contempt 
 I was looking for a bit of reasurrance and guidance for alternative treatments.  I certainly didn't get it here!  Ms. Sheehy has few suggestions for perimenopausal women other than HRT, which she describes as almost magical.  Since I have a family history of breast cancer, and--consequently-- no desire to try HRT, I needed books with a more positive tone and other treatment options.  I would strongly recommend Dr. Susan Love's Hormone book and The Pause by Lonnie Barbauch instead 
 Road depiction is very vague. Difficult to read. Somewhat useable with AAA maps. For the best maps see the series by Benchmark Maps. I have used their maps in New Mexico, California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona. Unfortunately, they do not have many states. I use the Delorme "Utah" with my AAA maps 
 Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else 
 This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else 
 This seller put this book under the 11th edition and ended up sending me a 4th edition....the book is completely useless...beware!!!! 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 Zombies and more zombies ..this is a cheesie zombie book...pun intended. the initial stories of how everyone dies are hard-hitting and good starters for a book, but the author is only killing everyone in the world so their bodies can start shuffling around to the low-grade reactions of the few survivors in Britain. I will admit that I bought this book thinking it was SF and the subsequent disappointment is vented here. But I have been reading books for over 35 years and have come to know different styles and methods and plots and so forth. So when I say that this book could have been good, but really sucks after the first few chapters, I am giving it the hairy eyeball of critical review. Anyone can write badly. Why publish such lame stuff? Of course, if you love horror stories then perhaps you are used to lame writing in return for the occasional thrill of horror. I tried reading a Stephen King novel once. The writing was so bad I threw it away after slogging thru half the book..always waiting for the story writing to improve. I guess it just isn't my cup of tea, but good writing is hard to miss whether its in a genre I prefer or not. OK, done venting now 
 This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good

 The book, "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" is a gross misnomer.  At best, the book should be entitled "A Good Personal Finance Guide".  If a person bought the book, as I did, for expert stock market investment guidance, he/she may likely be highly disappointed.  The book contains very good personal finance guidance, that's all.  Way overstated with the title! 
 I had my Pink iPod mini since Feb. 2005. It was fine until it died the next year on the exact day I got it, and the warranty ran out. I got it repaired at an Apple reseller, and then it died again  on the warranty expiration date. What is it with the iPods? It's like they have a self destruct inside! ):- 
 Two words sum up this book: Completely Unbalanced. That's a shame, because this book is focused on dungeons - and that's half the name of the game (the other half being "Dragons"). What should have been a slam-dunk product somehow became one of the worst books ever released by Wizards of the Coast for the Dungeons and Dragons game, and one that makes me question EVER buying another such product without reading it in detail first.  So, what precisely is wrong with this product? Where to begin...  - Class options are unbalanced. Class options are an interesting concept (one class ability is sacrificed for another ability). The problem is, the options ARE NOT BALANCED. One class might lose a relatively insignificant ability and gain an extremely powerful one, while another might lose a strong power in exchange for something that is useless. Most DMs won't allow these options any where near their games without significant fine-tuning (if at all).  - The new class is PAINFULLY unbalanced. The concept of the "Factotum" originally seems to be that of a 2nd Edition bard (an arcane jack-of-all trades), but ends up being the biggest munchkin class of all time. Factotum powers include: getting every skill in the game as a class skill (WHY DIDN'T THIS SET OFF ALARMS AT WOTC?!), getting trapfinding (can disarm traps with DCs over 20), not needing spellbooks, being able to re-select any arcane spell in the game to cast daily (up to their spell level limit), turning undead, healing, the ability to ignore damage reduction, the power to add their INT bonus to STR and DEX skill checks, the ability to add their INT bonus to their armor class, etc, etc, etc... How did this get past quality control and the playtesters?   - New items are illogical. Many of the new items introduced in this book seemed to have been designed by people that have no concept of what is going on in the game. The first example is the "wand bracer" from page 33 that shoots one of five wands into a character's hand when they extend a finger (due to a string attached to each finger). Besides the fact that the string mechanism would make it almost impossible to hold ANYTHING in the hand besides the strings, the designers forgot one simple thing: the people most likely to use this bracer are wizards, and their somatic spell casting components would constantly set off the bracer's wand-ejecting ability. The second example is the "wand chamber" that is built into the side of a weapon to hold a wand against a blade so that the wand is always ready. This design would result in the wand getting broken after every successful attack or parry - thus rendering it useless.  - Book lacks new, reusable material. Beyond the above complaints about what was added, it is important to note what has NOT been added: reusable information for DMs. Chapter four (Dungeon Design) has one large, significant table that spans a page and a half and will help DMs come up with broad dungeon concepts... and that's pretty much it. You'd think there would be large random encounter tables, maybe a table to design DETAILED NPC villains, detailed reasons for getting the party to go into a dungeon, better treasure tables, and numerous other things that would allow for faster dungeon design - but there aren't.   - Absurd Concepts. Two words: Acidborn Sharks. Now your dungeons can have sharks that have been magically engineered and bred to survive IN LAKES OF ACID. Why? Because too many people were swimming through the lakes of acid, so now they contain sharks to stop would-be adventurers. All these sharks need now are lasers attached to theirs heads and the insanity would be complete. :/       I could go on and on about the flaws, but the point should be clear by now: I found this book not only completely useless, but potentially unbalancing to any game I would run. But weren't there any useful tidbits in this tome, you ask? Only two come to mind:  - Chapter 6, Traps. The section on traps was useful in that seventeen new traps as well as modifications for established traps are presented for use. Though there isn't enough information here to justify the retail price of the book (there are other supplements devoted to the subject), the traps section is the one area I might reuse.  - Underground druids. I don't like how the "root walker" was ultimately presented, but I do like the concept - a druid devoted to the caves and below spaces of the world rather than the forests. Thumbs up for this concept!  In the end, I can not recommend this product - and I think Wizards of the Coast should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such an unbalanced supplement. Avoid this book at all costs if you value your game 
 Metallica has been with me for most of my life, we have been through a lot together.  Through good times and bad, Metallica's music was like my own personal "Theme Music" to my life story.  I stayed faithful throughout the years, even when most of the masses turned their back on the band because of their different "sell out" music experiments.  After reading countless reviews of this album I see mostly everyone who ever really enjoyed Metallica's music were completely let down.  So here's just another long time fan basically expressing how utterly disappointed he is for what this band has become.  All you have to do is read the reviews on Amazon.com to see the disgust Metallica's few remaining"real fans" feel.  I must say after watching their documentary "Some Kind of Monster" and seeing all the hardships they went through during the production of this album I can understand to a certain degree WHY this album turned into the trainwreck it did.    The band would've been much better off if they took all the "master recordings" of St. Anger and buried them.  They hyped it up saying it was a return to their roots and the fast and furious blood pumping band we all loved so much was back, that couldn't be more false.  There are absolutely no redeeming qualities to this travisty.  The only thing this album is good for is to show other musicians what NEVER TO DO.  I just can't believe for one minute any of them would ever think this actually sounded good.  What's next for Metallica?  I hope they learned from this mistake and actually deliver the promise they gave us about returning to their roots and give us the JUSTICE we all deserve.  I hate to say it but it might actually take a miracle to rebound from this one.  It is quite possible that Metallica's next album could most certainly be their last if it has any trace of this album's total foolishness.  Good luck boys, you certainly need it.  Metallica is the band I could honestly say made the BEST metal album ever "JUSTICE FOR ALL" and the worst "ST. ANGER" ! I love comeback stories, and they certainly need to make the biggest comeback in the history of music to RESTORE the world's opinion on the once great Metallica 
 Not appreciably less racist than the 1941 diatribe "Germany Must Perish!" by Theodore N Kaufman which advocated sterilizing the entire German population.  As an aside, I doubt whether that little masterpiece (pubished before holocaust started) was helpful to the Jews in German-occupied territory.  What the Nazis did which is actually proveable is bad enough without resorting to fabrications, distortions, and racist, anti-teutonic rhetoric.  However one does wonder why it is treated as heresy to question the extent of Nazi war crimes against the Jews while no other episodes of state-sponsored mass murder (Lenin/Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot) get the same treatment.  Food for thought 
 Not when the illustrations are as poorly drawn and pointless as these. eg people staring at computers, sweeping arrows with colored blends, or pointing hands (proving, yes they are hard to draw!). I can however follow the reasoning.   This is yet another programmer who has trouble explaining the jargon but has noticed books that do a good job of being user friendly, have pictures. I found this book to be just like those inane PowerPoint presentations that middle executives think expresses the right side of their brain. A right side that seems to be made of cheap PC clip art.  It doesn't help every time the book gets to a core idea, that it glosses over it as if it is obvious, without explaining the detail. Nor that on top of the meaningless graphics, the book is full of DTP blunders that obviously nobody has checked. Such as text set in fonts with mismatching encodings, resulting in strange accented characters being substituted for whatever the author intended.  Why do programmers have such difficulty producing clear, sequential, logical and carefully crafted expression, that has been checked for errors?   I thought that was their job 
 Make a mix of Michael's first two solo albums (Michael Schenker Group and MSG), add UFO's "Doctor Doctor" and that's the set list for this live album recorded in Japan. So, the utility of this album is in accord with your preference for live albums or not, because, if you already own hhis first two albums, this album is utterly superfluous. At least the line up is the same of MSG: Barden, Michael, Glen, Raymond and POwell, and they deliver with their customary high skills and professionalism 
 Overall, not an entertaining book.  I struggled to stay interested in the story despite my track record of loving books having to do with any Hollywood subject matter.  I found the characters lacked depth and the end was incredibly cliche.  There was very little creativity at all 
 VCI's budget DVD starts out well enough for the obscure thriller Lady Ice, with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come. Unfortunately, as soon as the credits end, the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs I've ever seen on DVD. Pass on this one from VCI, and hopefully down the line there will be a new widescreen transfer so we can see how the film is supposed to look after the credits. 
 I do not like this CD!The only song I like is We Fall Down.Donnie,you can do better than that.If you want real gospel music,get Donnie's new CD,Psalms,Hymns,and Spiritual Songs,Tye Tribbett and G.A and Israel and New Breed 
 Andrew Weill is perhaps the most well-known of these type of practioners.  Unfortunately, some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven. For example, in study after study, large amnounts of Vitamin C given orally do absolutely nothing more than a   placebo for cancer patient.  Yet he still preaches this.  Given intravenously, actually, there is some evidence that it may work for some people..but it does not work by stimulating your immune system..it works in a different way.  The book How To treat and Prevent Cancer with Natural Medicine is far superios in my opinion, even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002.  Even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking Vitamin C orally over a placebo,  and the authors freely admitted it. But much of what the discussed in that book..Eight Magic supplements to take when you have cancer..has actually been proven. I am a cancer patient with myeloma.  Maitake D fraction, curcumin (it must be taken w/bioperine an hour before meals), selenium, and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on.  They do not promise that they have a cure of anything..they only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine. They do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure.  The book by Quiallan I think claims that an organic diet will cure you, and there is post after post that this has actually worked.  Maybe it has..but as a myeloma patient..my immune system is overstimulated, so I cannot take most immune system supplements..and some like Vitamin C are actually antagonistic In Vitro to myeloma treatments..this usually translates to the same thing in the body..unlike positive in studies that often do not pan out.  Anyway, I am not saying Dr. Weill is all wrong, but do not pretend he has a cure.  I have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice, another two by healers (I  am not religious), and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his PH totally got rid of his cancer.  I believe these people all may have gotten rid of their LOCALIZED tumors this way. For blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloma (a cancer of blood produced in the marrow), we do not exactly have localized tumors.  But with the addition of supplements mentioned in Dr. Murray et al's book, my response to medications has been phenomenal and I have went into remission. Unfortunately, at this time, myeloma always comes back from remission. There is new understanding why this may be so..that just came out December 2005.  There is even a drug available..but it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while 
 Normally I enjoy reading Danielle Steel books but I found this one to be way off base and I could barely stand to finish it.  I found that the romance between Gabbie and the priest to be awful and the fact that he killed himself over it to be worse.  The priest and Gabbie were both weak and that would not happen like that in real life I do not believe.  Their whole romance was one of the worst things I have ever read.  Then the ending of the book was horrible also how can she fall in love with someone whom she hardly knows and has never seen outside of a hospital talk about a violation of the doctor patient relationship! The ending of the book left a lot to be desired I would not recommend this book to anyone after reading the whole book 
 First CD of five titles this worthless fourth-rate glam metal band had bothered to put out.Cannot believe they lasted that long.I remember seeing these guys open for Alice Cooper on his 'Trash' tour.Talk about your suck-support acts.Simply love some of the song titles here,like their Mtv video "Naughty Naughty" and "Bang Bang".Like,how long did it take for them to think those up?Other hair bands I don't care for include Trixter,Warrant(after CD no.2)and Firehouse.Total waste of time,money and effort.I've heard some patrons compare this band to the likes of White Lion,Faster Pussycat or Poison.Don't you dare!Danger Danger doesn't EVEN come close.Avoid at all costs 
 Geeeez, I picked up a couple of books by Ms Miles and looked through them today.  I was going to buy my wife some reading material that was both infomative and entertaining.  Not this woman. I'd like to keep my wife sane, happy, and not a man hater.   Actually, I do feel sorry for the far left radical feminist extremists who see the world through man-hating scenarios.  They must be very miserable.  They are mean. 
 This guy pretends to be THE great investor, but as a seasoned investor and mentor to many more, I was not impressed.  He should write about something he knows about like world travel.  Even Robert Kiyosaki dumped him after his earlier book and got a different real estate advisor 
 Probably the most overrated performer of all times, Mr. Bowie is a perfect mystery. While there are moments when his genius clearly shines through (Life on Mars, Space Oddity, All the Madmen, Kooks, notably The Man who sold the World and few more)it remains a pretty frustrating thing to like him overall.I saw him live couple years ago and he really pulled the crowd's strings, undeniably an incredible showman. What about Ziggy Srardust then? A classic rock and roll album topped with Bowie's characteristic juicy English eccentricity.That's all fine, but why should everybody go raving mad about it?I'm utterly perplexed.At the time of its release much more talented bands like Led Zeppelin and The Who were in full swing, Queen were just starting to gain prominence, but people still paid much more attention to the thin white duke.Oh well, must have been his make up.. 
 This was NOT the apple armband they advertised, it was a cheap foreign knockoff - I wish I had never bought it. Terrible misrepresentation of sold item. Buyer beware!! 
 cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top  poorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it  putting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes.  again..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fitting  pros .......... i guess it can hold a lot of cds.... 
 This book tries to explain how and why the media would try to send out its ideals to the masses through a selective exposé of certain television programs such as THE SIMPSONS, BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, REN & STIMPY SHOW, MURPHY BROWN, LA LAW, COPS; political and celebrity personalities like the BUSH's, BILL CLINTON, WILLIAM BORROUGHS, PHIL DONAHUE, RUSH LIMBOUGH, PEEWEE HERMAN (Paul Reubens), THE JACKSONS, MADONNA, ICE T, and even quite peculiar for me even the whole controversy with one of my personal faves U2 over the legal frictions with a parody band called NEGATIVLAND (which is rather more documented on the documentary feature flick of the said group) and even more so about the band that I often refer to -  JESUS JONES regarding their music video for their perrenial track "Right Here Right Now" and the advent of MTV's outbreak with the likes of music videos from A-HA; BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN; and even more so mentioning the likes of `wanna-whats' like R.U. SERIOUS, and the cult of Genesis P-Orrige called THEE TEMPLE OV PSYCHIC YOUTH - the book nearly gives an impression that the author is culture-shocked, and proposed to infect likewise with the `memes' (ie. A term used by the author to refer about the certain data/info's that are being assimilated n=by the media which in turn affects to influence the masses, at least in the way I understood it and could simply put it) it presents to expose - however, the whole matter is subject to the particular perspective preference of the readers personal comprehension.  The book is said to have been "revised and updated" from a two-year's span by 1996 - even seems quite un-innovative even from that time, and most of the authors' analysis are nothing new. Rushkoff, although being quite informative nevertheless from time to time with the book only seem to mainly dwell on a surface level, when what we need is to see more of the primal motivating factors behind the dissemination of counter-culture trends and ideas which Rushkoff attempted to disseminate within the length of his work. 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 This slim novel by Somali writer Farah was originally published in 1970 but fell out of print until the widespread acclaim of his "Blood in the Sun" trilogy in the late '90s. Written in 1968, the book is set during the months leading up to Somalia's independence in 1960. Like a great deal of postcolonial African fiction available in translation, its primary theme is the role of women in society. The story is written from the perspective of Ebla (perhaps so named because at the time of the writing in 1968, Italian archeologists had just identified the site of ancient city of the same name in Syria), an 18-year-old nomad woman who flees her rural settlement when she learns of her impending marriage to a middle-aged man. In doing so, she is spurning the traditional values of her culture -- perhaps foreshadowing for the societal changes that will come with independence and modernity.  Sneaking out of her hut in the wee hours, she flees without a plan, leaving her brother and grandfather behind. Her first stop is a small town (although quite large and bewildering to her), where she stays with a distant cousin. There, she cares for her cousin's pregnant wife and makes the acquaintance of a confident woman next door. Drawn into smuggling by her cousin and alerted to his plan to sell her off as a bride, she flees again, this time to Mogadishu with the nephew of the neighbor. Here, life is even more confusing, as she becomes his bride. When he leaves for several months training in Italy, she must rely on another self-sufficient older woman in her building. She somewhat passively reacts to this abandonment by allowing herself to be propelled into the arms of yet another man, who pays her for the distinction of becoming his "wife".  The cultural mechanics of all this are somewhat confusing to the non-native reader and a certain amount of annotation would certainly help this almost 40-year-old book. For example, some background on the quasi-Islamic practice of informal "temporary" marriages at the time would provide some much-needed context for some of Ebla's actions. So while the broad theme of Ebla's treatment as just another "beast" or "cattle" subject to the whim of the men around her is evident, I suspect there's a good deal of nuance that lost along the way. Written when Farah was only in his early 20s, the English prose is rather awkward and makes for choppy reading. While certainly of interest to those interested in feminism in Africa, those seeking a more accessible introduction to Farah's work might be better off trying his more recent novels, Links and Knots, which are set in Mogadishu during and after the American peacekeeping efforts in the early '90s. 
 Alright, for those of you who say Rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it.  Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  But she doesn't.  Thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  All books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your IQ.    Any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns.  Rand, at least as portrayed in what I've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  And this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  They cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   The pieces of art she says are empty ARE empty, absolutely.  They don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  Nothing to offer her, that is.    How is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling OTHER people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) What they should read?  Truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  They have their bias like anyone else.  I say read in variety.  Observe art outside of Rand's choice of art.  Take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  If you then agree because YOU agree, then I say great.  Its the basic individualistic response that Rand seems to forget to address.  She says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  She says be an individual, but only I know the basis of who you want to be 
 When we first got it, we loved the suction and filtering.  Our son has asthma and this is a good choice for keeping high air quality.    After the first year, the hose got cracks, then a few more months in, the belt and clutch went.  These are expensive repairs, so you really pay for this vacuum.    I thought you pay a high price upfront, you'll be covered with high quality lasting hardware, but nope.  You may as well just get a lower priced, higher performing machine 
 This is the other side of the coin to the attacks on contemporary government, finance and business contained in books like Korten: When Corporations Rule the Worldand the earlier Hawken: The Ecology of Commerce.   The purpose of Simon and his collaborators was to present a 'scorecard' on the progress of humanity against historical trends and to predict the level of our future health and prosperity (he specifically declines to become involved in predicting our happiness).   The basis of the book is that historical trends have always been the best guide to the long term future and, in the absence of any overwhelming evidence to the contrary (he doesn't find any) will continue to be the best guide to the future. It is crafted as a riposte to those who have seen storm waters ahead, who he refers to collectively (and unnecessarily derisively) as 'the doomsayers'.   The underlying message, which is only occasionally explicit, is that anywhere that there is a problem, we can rely on the market to fix it.  It contains five substantive Parts plus a Section on Thinking about the Future and a Conclusion - 58 chapters in all crammed with facts and figures. The substantive parts are:  	* 	Life, Death and Health 	* 	Standard of Living, Productivity and Poverty 	* 	Natural Resources 	* 	Agriculture, Food, Land and Water 	* 	Pollution and the Environment.  I think it was Samuel Smiles who proposed the mantra 'Every day, in every way, I grow better and better' and Simon and his colleagues have taken it up with a vengeance. Some of the conclusions are, of course unquestionable. Infant mortality in the developed countries has fallen dramatically, average standards of living - at least as measured by GDP - have risen, and so on. The picture is nowhere near as rosy in the Third World, but the authors choose not to focus on that, nor on the extent to which developed countries may have contributed to the problems of the third world in order to achieve the trends with which the authors are so pleased.  Others of their conclusions fall into the 'so what' category; chapters on alcohol consumption and the rate of murder and suicide don't really add much to either the argument or the readability of the book.   Other chapters are much more tendentious and are written on the basis that 'if you can't prove absolutely that there is a problem, and that that problem directly and adversely affects humans, then its not a problem'. Their conclusions are, to say the least, surprising and there is more than a whiff of what has been rudely described as the advocate's arts of never telling an untruth but relying on suppression of the truth and suggestions that lead in a false direction (suppressio veri et suggestio falsi). For example: species extinctions?: not happening, what's a species anyway and what does 'endangered' mean if anything  acid rain?: may actually be good for the crops  reserves of oil?: not a problem, never has been, never will be  nuclear waste?: a power station only produces a truck load of high level waste a year, in 100 years it will take 0.1 of an ounce to kill you and of course we can keep it safe. In any case, its better than coal, while solar or other renewal forms of energy are not economically viable (nothing about externalities, precious little about small matters like decommissioning, disasters touched on only for their direct cash cost)  ozone hole?: it may well have more to do with stratospheric temperature than with CFCs and there's no proof that it does any harm  The figures on which they rely would be more impressive if there were not a strong impression that they are selected to suit their case (something of which their opponents are of course also sometimes guilty). For example, dismissing the problem of pollution with a stack of figures about declining levels of pollution in US cities, there is no mention at all of the fact that part of this may be due to the wholesale export of polluting processes to other countries, such as Mexico.  On the basis of these, sometimes selective histories, they predict the long term future (with the saver that there may of course be short term variations). Based on Keynes' dictum that 'in the long term, we are all dead', this provides a reasonably safe platform for the contributors.  With a good deal of care and a bit of luck, we may prove the authors right. There is little doubt that we have the technology and the knowledge to be able to deal with the issues that face us globally - if we also have the wisdom and if we make a rapid enough start.   Whether the correct approach is, as the authors would suggest, one which focuses only on the direct verifiable and short term effects on humans and which relies totally on existing market mechanisms is a much more dubious question. Where we are dealing with large scale impacts on a global system, where cause and effect may be distant in time and space, a policy of sturdy denial until every last sceptic has finally admitted to have seen the 'smoking gun' seems an unnecessarily dangerous course to pursue.  It requires great dedication to read the whole of the book. On the other hand, because of the breadth of its range, it is a valuable source for scenario builders and others - provided that the facts and perspectives put forward in it are checked against other sources.  If you do believe that 'all is for the best' and that our current system of governance is ideal, this is unquestionably the book for you. It gives you a mountain of facts, figures, trend lines and assertions with which to confound your enemy 
 The idea behind the book is great, but the book itself fails to meet  expectations. The description on Native American life seemed  superficial  and like it had no experience or research behind it.  The charachters were  good, but the whole book seemed like a rough draft.The story never went  into enough detail. It jumped from one event to another without ever  spending enough time on each event to interest me.My advice is to skip it 
 I read a lot on cartography, particularly cartographic history, and I was excited to get this book. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. It has masses of carto-bibliographical detail, not put to much use in supporting a broader argument. And it is very short on any insight or analysis beyond the most superficial and obvious. Historical maps reflect the concerns and attitudes of the times and cultures in which they were produced - I didn't need to wade through this book to know that.  This book could be useful for reference, but it won't deepen your understanding 
 This pile of steaming crap is one of those message movies that comes across as pretentious, self-righteous nonsense.  There is a big difference between the quality of a movie and the message that it attempts to convey.  Powder may be trying to convey a lofty message, but I assure you that the presentation is laughable and just plain stupid.    The only people that could possibly take this dog excrement seriously are those individuals that like to sit around and brood that nobody understands them.  A terrible, terrible, terrible movie 
 I admit I didn't finish reading this book, as I was so confused after a few chapters that I gave up. 1. It is unclear what exactly Ladoux means by emotion. Sometimes it seems that he is only talking about emotions that result in an action. (Reasonable as that's what you can test) But there are passages when he talks about "liking" somebody as an emotion. I love my husband and I don't like Tom Cruise but I would hardly equate those feelings as equal emotions. If I read a recipe and think I'd like to taste it, is that the same as the rage I feel against people who have hurt me? They certainly have different origins in my brain (I think) 2. I got totally lost in his review of the psychological studies of emotion. Yes, the development of theories is an important part of the study but when I still can't tell what you are theorizing about, the various diagrams and referrals to studies didn't help. I also lost the logical steps in the argument, perhaps because the summary was brief; I didn't see how B logically followed A in some of his review of the theories. Perhaps the rest of the book redeems it, but if this book is written for the layperson, more care is needed in explaining the boundaries and definitions 
 this is political polemicism, not history  to bring it up to the present we only have to look at how Hallibruton has bankrupted our nation for generations to come. CApitalism did not save our nation but destroyed it, as great Americans from Jefferson to Eisenhower predicted.  Please check out the POV of this author. Read the editorial reviews here for a full explanation of where heis coming from and what he wants to sell you. THis is not an academic scholarly text but self-serving profitable political propaganda of the kind which has ruined our nation this millenium 
 So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.  Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.  I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack 
 When I bought the book, I was really looking forward to it.  I THREW IT AWAY. What a horrible book! Medieval homosexuality is not a 'must-read' for young adults! I was ashamed of it 
 Which is the presumed motive for this extended revisitation of an extensively analyzed subject.  This book is bizarrely organized which somewhat masks the fact that it has almost nothing new to say.  Odd comments aside ("...the casual amorality of Chandlerian violence"?!?), the text is little more than a series of introductory remarks with thumbnail bios of hardboiled writers and auteurist asides that cobble together plot summaries and allusions to the writings of other critics. Chapter 4 starts off with promise but fizzles. The extended closing comments on the French New Wave, the epilog, and the needlessly repeated selected credits are pure filler 
 This book isn't on my favorites list. To me, the plot was confusing and took to many twists. And at some points the word choice was unskillful and didn't have a fluency it needed. It might just be because this book is truely for younger readers then I am, I'm an odd rater, or this book isn't the best in the world. I really just didn't get hooked at all. I'm not really requesting it for tweens or over. Or for anyone honestly. I request 'The last dog on earth' much more then this book. I liked that one MUCH better 
 ...then perhaps all men should read 'A Women's History of the World', now called, I believe, 'Who Cooked the Last Supper...' (for another look at how facts can be cherry-picked, warped to suit any argument, and sweeping generalizations are made from singular statistical data, and correlations are based off presumptive conclusions demonstrating no adequate causation--hmm, only from a woman's point-of-view and a whole lot more unapologetic in tone...I believe Rosalind Miles came from that era of "bitter feminist"--the male-bashing years...   Why I'm even wasting brain-cells on this is beyond me, but what the world didn't need was yet one more book--'The myth of Male power'--(you'd do better to read Joseph Campbell and discover the true beauty of myth and symbolism, and some archetypes of masculinity)--that attempts to present the answer to all men's problems (and women's apparently) rehashed once again by misconstrued statistics, sensationalized news contorted to astound and astonish as opposed to making one think, all fit into a pattern of fallacy so apparent, this could be used as an exemplar for intro to logic texts.  Someone in an earlier review stated how disturbing it is so many readers seem to respond favorably to this work without realizing how simplistic the 'facts' proposed are, taken out of context and construed as 'deep' research. What I find even more disheartening is how easily duped most American readers are into not being able to recognize 'pop'-culture hysteria books when they see them and analyze/critique accordingly.    As a case in point, citing men's suicide rates exceeding women's as they go through adolescence into their 20's and 30's, writing the numbers off as a tirade of 'man-the-victim-of-vicious-masculine-stereotypes-see-how-fragile-we-are-damn-the feminists-who've-made-us-suffer-for-demasculinization". How Sir Warren uses these numbers ignores complex issues of familial, socio-economic, ethnic, racial--along with gender--(and even geography) factors.  This statement is not made in negation of a consistently documented trend of higher rates of suicide amongst men over women--all anyone needs to do is go to the CDC website  http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/suifacts.htm to see that. To say this trend is happening because of feminism's cancerous influence upon the wider arena of modern society however, thus demonstrating the victimization of men, the subsequent hacking-away of the male-coping mechanisms in terms of cognitive and behavioral health demonstrates one of these sweeping generalizations, and a lack of correlation/causation.    As noted from the CDC website, women are three times more likely than men to attempt suicide (though not carry through on it). Thus, the prevalence of suicide ATTEMPTS amongst women v. men (if we're talking victim v. victim here) is higher for women; men happen to carry through with their attempt on the first go as opposed to women.  Did the self-destructive tendency come about as poisoned offspring resulting from feminism's damaging influence to masculine development/mental-health/social identity through adolescence? What about the damage feminism has done to women? After all, I'm 3 times more likely to try and kill myself, because I've obviously been conditioned by my XX chromosome to be manipulative and attention-seeking, and in my journey to evolve into a more self-directed and empowered individual I've suffered a crisis in my feminine identity (assertiveness warring against my more natural tendency toward passivity and submission).  So, where men I guess blow their heads off 4 times more frequently than women, women are 3 times more likely to slit wrists and call 911.  Hmm, I don't know, seems to me masculinity is fairly intact--purpose-driven and determined straight to the finish.   I don't honestly believe the above statement, but can anyone see where this sort of reasoning leads? The broad sweeping blame on one civil rights movement (of which feminism ought to be included) attempting to effect societal progress for a discriminated populace elicits a backlash of accusation, wherein feminism is touted as the reason men have lost their identity, self-confidence, jobs security, social security, effectiveness in combat, desire for combat, now experience role-confusion, etc etc...all  in 21st century America.   Has the male ego become so fragile over the last 50 years that it would allow itself to be debased by such clap-trap argumentation and conclusions as to be found in this book? Are men's identities really so fragile in this country, or in the world, that in trying to reclaim the 'masculine-aura', men must segregate themselves and allow themselves to be defined by one more author espousing post-modernist biological determinism obscured by seeming "deep-research" and profound insight into the male psyche?  If anyone is interested in how the world thinking operated in terms of men and women and gender roles in the era prior to "2nd Wave Feminism", [...] If anyone believes this was a better world, then I invite you to continue looking through rose-colored glasses.   For others, especially Sir Warren Farrell, what is it about feminism that has frightened so many, and disgusted so many others? Not to quote a bumper-sticker, but "feminism is the radical idea that women are people too", doesn't seem to scream femi-nazi.   Indeed, I think one review from "Fire in the Belly" had it right on--if you're looking to reclaim your masculinity, you'd do better to rent a John Wayne movie or watch Gladiator or The 300. Now there are paragons of masculine ethos and heroism--even for women (to enjoy on so many levels).  Ultimately, a purpose driven life isn't defined by gender, nor on self-victimization.   On the other hand, as one of my favorite authors once wrote, "It's only stupid, conventional men who like stupid, conventional women," (ah, G. Bradshaw).    I can only wonder at the kind of history with women a man like Sir Warren Farrell has had since he obviously claims to have the answers as to society's ills with them 
 This was a good Mary J album, but it was not a Mary J Blige album: Only two songs really rocked: it's on and seven days, everything else was okay. I say down load to the two songs and keep rolling. 
 how Irishman Harris could have so gloriously portrayed Cromwell, who initiated the total destruction of the Irish nation, people, language, religion and culture is beyond comprehension, unless he purposefully portrayed him over the top in a guerrilla effort to sabotage this hero-making of a vile and brutal dictator.  Harris later made repentance to his IRish heritage in The Field, a far more interesting film.   
 This is not a biography but rather a discussion of each of Hitchcock's films. For each film there is: - Detailed synopsis - Cast and Crew details - Analysis of the film  These first two of these items can be obtained from the Internet for free and who really wants to know the details of the story anyway? The analysis of each film is largely a waste of time as Spoto tends to over-analyse each film to the point of distraction while offering no real insights.  If you want to find out more about Hitchcock's films I would recommend McGilligan's excellent biography. This discusses each film in the context of Hitchcock's life and career and is far more illuminating 
 I was looking forward to purchasing another Beth Orton album. Central Reservation and Pass In Time are marvelous. Imagine my dismay when I popped the CD into my lovely two-channel high end system to hear what amounts to MP3 quality sound. Simply awful. Move the production back to England. The people in New York obviously don't know what they're doing. 
 Normally I love Rita Mae Brown's stories.  I can't wait for them to come out! But this one I found to be disappointing.  It had virtually no plot and little interesting interactions with the animals but what felt like an inordinate amount of "lecturing" about various and sundry things.  Frankly, it was dull which is something I never thought I would say about one of Ms. Brown's books. 
 I had to send this item back twice and still havenot recieved the correct product never order anything from Best Price Center, the owner denied being the correct contact after I spoke with him multiple times at the same number. 
 I checked this book out from the library, and I wouldn't recommend that, let alone buying it. If you get it as a Christie fan, you'll be disappointed. The connections are loose, forced, and meager. Reread one of the biographical entries on Christie and learn MUCH more. If you get it as a travelogue, there are many better. The coverage of sites and culture is superficial. Finally, the writing is nothing special at all. It's travel and Christie lite, if not misleading and thin. Truly not worth your time. 
 This book is unapologetically about triviality. It begins with the rise of popularity of the trivial, illusion and fakery, in America since the time of P.T. Barnum. It is about the creators and consumers of illusion who  replaced 'survivors' in after the transition to life in the megalopolis in  America. John Berger has pointed out that zoos, stuffed animals, pets and  eventually Disneyworld emerged as mankind became divorced from the fight to  survive against nature, where animals were essential. The book does not  explain why, in its appetite for illusion and triviality (consumerism,  consumption of the media) America is so advanced with respect to Europe  (the decline is there, if slower: the worst Hollywood films are extremely  popular among Europe's youth). Gamson informs us of Holmes' expectation  that photography would lead to the triumph of superficiality, and of  Boorstin's description of the celebrity as a person who is well-known for  his well-knownness. Political campaigns are accurately described as  pre-packaged media affairs, where the participants have become game-players  and the events themselves, like talk-shows, have become pseudo-events.  People immitating the media immitating people. The future is trivial  because trivial expectations determine the future via pre-packaged daily  behavior. Gamson does not explain why we have evolved to this state of  super-triviality, and why we seem to be stuck with it. This was more or  less explained poetically by Spengler, and also poetically in still fewer  words by John Berger, who informs us clearly and concisely on the subjects  of Gamson's discourse: "It would ... be possible to talk of the  'homelessness' of the bourgeois with his town house, his country home, his  three cars, his televisions, his tennis court, his wine cellar-it would be  just possible, yet nothing about his class interests me, for there is  nothing left to discover." Gamson's book is precisely about the  people, and their admirors, about whom there is nothing worth discovering 
 The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters "Guard One" just shows you don't even try to care. The plot is so hair-brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache -- I just learned, to my horror, that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times. I'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise, but it's been ruined forever by... this. Somewhere, Baby Jesus is crying 
 Basic concepts but a good read for those under heavy-handed leadership 
 Any resemblence between what is stated in this book and what's actually going on in the Middle East is purely coincidental.  What the reader gets instead is some amazing fascist propaganda that won't truly serve anyone.    Hirst writes for the Guardian, a rather famous British newspaper that took decades to establish a fine reputation for its journalism.  It is staggering to realize just how much damage the Guardian has done to this reputation in just a short while by permitting such nonsense to invade its pages.  And I think we need to ask ourselves how and why this has happened.  The staff of the Guardian has to be professional.  One would think that they would hesitate to destroy their paper in such a manner.  After all, it would cost the paper money.  It might ruin the paper entirely, and put them out of jobs.  One might suppose it unlikely that they would want to violate any semblence of good journalistic practice just to hurt a few Jews or Israelis.  However, the experience of reading this book and seeing some of the reviews has led me to a hypothesis of what has happened.  The destruction of the Guardian's reputation as a conduit of good journalism has not put it out of business at all.  Just as this book has brought money to its author, the ghastly articles in the Guardian bring money to the newspaper, if only by appearing sensational and controversial.    I think we readers have a duty to try to reverse this trend.  Just as dedicated people have made great progress in the campaign against cigarette smoking, the same can be done in the campaign against bad journalism.  We can warn our friends about books such as this one.  And we ought to do just that 
 After searching for months for a lesbian novel told in the third person, i was really excited to find Venus Envy.  I am currently on chapter 22 and I think i'll stop here.  I didn't like hte beginning, I haven't liked the progression into the middle and after reading these reviews, I think i'll jsut skip the end.  I read Brown's Ruby Fruit Jungle and i had really loved it.  Despite some far-fetched plot points, I was able to suspend my belief and give her the benefit of the doubt, but this one.. it just doesn't work.  I blame the dialogue.  It's really awful. But not that the rest of it is helping much.  It feels as if the author let the plot dictate the novel and not the characters and that just makes for bad writing.  I'd go for other Brown books, but just not this one 
 this was written before the internet, the majority of information in this book is available online or in basic brewing books, the gadgets described are mostly widely manufactured and / or easily available 
 Dammit!  Whats happened to these guys?  Everything has slowed down and gotten pretty boring.  Al, who was once a great aggressive frontman has now decided to lose his edge and try to actually carry tunes instead of just growling the lyrics like he used to.  I also liked them much better as the 4 piece they once were.  It would be tough to still classify these guys as punk rock anymore. . .as far as musical styles go anyway.  Nothing beats The Gangs All Here or anything recorded when Mike was still singing with them.  Dont bother with this one if youre a fan of the older stuff 
 When I first saw the trailers for this film, I figured it would be a comedy and it did actually seem funny.  However, when I finally saw this movie, my first impression was that it could not be further from the truth.  It started out, somewhat, as a comedy then quickly turned into a drama which, unfortunately, doesn't work for Robin Williams.  The movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie. Suspense in a supposed comedy movie?   Man of the Year is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. I would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think.  
 I found this story to be extremely elementary.  This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 Dr. Lane wrote this book so he could sell his shark cartilage. He wrote this book to sell a product that does not work. Sharks do get cancer, but incidences of cancer are much lower than in humans. The shark immune system may be better adapted to combat cancer. That does not justify grinding up shark cartilage and selling it. Dr. Lane's company sells the stuff for $130 a pound. I would reccomend reading "The Shark Chronicles" by John A. Musick. The book does a great job of describing this awe inspiring creatures 
 I was so excited about this product.  I love simple appliances and this one fit the bill.  However the filters were impossible to find and the whole thing stopped working after a month of use!  Don't buy this product.  Spend the extra money and get a better humidifier 
 I read many romance novels.  I accept hokey writing, unbelievable plots, unrealistic pairings, the whole bit.  But "Wanted:  One Special Kiss" made my brain get so frustrated I had to put the book down before I finished it.  The main character Lila physically attacks her sister in order to get to Earth, which for me made her extremely unsympathetic.  And even though it was slightly a science fiction story, the science was atrocious.  The author claims the male hero had an "unusually high ratio of the XY chromosome" which, while I know not everyone understands genetics, I thought someone in the editing process would have checked that one out.    In order to enjoy this book you will have to suspend your judgement so thoroughly you might not get it back 
 how can i write a review if i can't see the book.  you are telling me to review the book, but it is not available for review 
 This book is stuck in an archaic age.  Get something more relevan 
 Don't buy this book.  Please.  It is not worth the time, money or brain cells.  I recieved this book as a gift for my birthday (what are you trying to say Mom?).  I proceded to skim it enough to be competant enough to write this review, and then threw it directly in the trash can.  Where it belongs.    The book lists approximatly 25 different occasions in life and tries to show how to dress for them. Examples of some of these occasions are work, work casual, date, girls night out, casual wear, summer wedding, pregnancy.  For each occasion, the book has a cartoon picture of a "frumpy" girl and a "foxy" girl.  The author then attempts to explain how to be the foxy girl and not the frumpy girl.  Unfortunatly her advice consists mainly of her repeating advice that anyone with half a brain would already know.    Take her "work casual" chapter as an example.  Her "frumpy" cartoon girl comes to work wearing jeans with holes, a dirty "kiss me I'm Irish" tee shirt, and an old bookbag.  Unless you work in a coal mine, you already know that this kind of outfit is obviously a big no any day of the week.  Her "foxy" cartoon is what you would expect - nice jeans, blouse, heels.  Duh.  The advice is equally as dumb.  Since my copy of "Frumpy" is in a landfill somewhere, I can't exactly quote, but I know it goes something like this - "Like, don't dress like that frumpy girl on the left!  Like yeah!  Dress like the foxy girl on the right!  And like don't like wear jeans with holes in them!"  Okay maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit but trust me.  Her advice tells you nothing.    The thing that makes me so angry about this book is, it's insulting!  This woman acts as if you have no idea whatsoever how to dress yourself.  The pictures make you feel bad because even the so-called frumpy girls are hot!  And the advice is stuff that you already know how to do and are probably already doing.  Such as brushing your teeth in the morning.  I'm not joking, that is actual advice from the book!  The worst part is the little "about the author" section.  It basically says that this chick and her friend out in California somewhere decided to write this book because they wanted to help the rest of the clueless masses dress more like them.  Yeah... those are two people I NEVER WANT TO MEET.  If you really want to change your style for the better, I would reccomend Kendall Farr's book "Pocket Stylist."  She actually shows you how to shop and dress better for all occasions, unlike the woman who wrote "Frumpy to Foxy."  I urge you, please don't make Ms. Rubin's wallet or ego any fatter than it already is 
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 I got the recorded version of this book. I listen to it with my 9 year old son, who's on a basketball team. He likes it. We'll listen to in the car, and he enjoys the lessons of 'hard work leads to victory' and 'teammates always watch out for one another'.  I was hoping for something more useful, though. There is nothing in this book that helps a college basketball fan learn why Duke's basketball program is consistently superior to the other college programs. Little to no discussion about recruiting, conditioning, nutrition, or how practices are structured. The book only focuses on the stars of Duke basketball, like Grant Hill, Bobby Hurley, Christian Laetner and a few others. It doesn't really talk about the other players on the team. And, it basically states "Bobby Hurley practiced harder than the other guys. That's why he was the starting point guard." Really?? It only takes practice and 'heart' to be the starter on an NCAA winning basketball team?   So, the other guys who DON'T start are slackers, or don't try as hard? hmmm... That's not the world i live in. I read Phil Jackson's book "The Last Season". In it Jackson discusses his frustration with Kobie Bryant. Comparing pro players to college players isn't a perfect comparison. But Jackson lists Bryant's lack of committment all through that book. And Jackson states how he wanted to start a different point guard, but he knew the replacement wasn't as good a player, even though he worked 5 times harder.  -- Mike K also draws weak parallels between trying hard and winning at basketball, and trying hard and winning at business.  I've been in the business world 20+ years, and there is very little i can use from these tapes.  I've read a lot of business history, and i know that business don't always fail because of lack of effort. Many times other factors come into play. Like when AT&T laid of 10's of 1000s of employees around 2001. Michael Armstrong kept pushing and 'motivating' his 'team' to beat WorldCom. Yet WorldCom's annual reports kept presenting false numbers that stated WorldCom was delivering long distance services for much cheaper than AT&T could, and doing it at a substantial profit.  So, Armstrong fired many people, many hard working people who did everything they could to 'compete' hard. We've since learned those annual report numbers were lies, and the executives who published them are in jail. But, it's cold comfort to the AT&T executives who yelled at employees for not being creative or not being 'devoted to the team, because our competitors are delivering these services.' If the grammar school cliches of this book are used by executives trying to compete in an intensely competitive global economy, those business will soon be outmaneuvered. So, Coach K, your grammar school lessons of 'try hard, you'll always succeed' don't play out in the real world.   
 I have not read the book but tried to listen to the audiotape version and found it hopelessly tedious. Some of the problem may be as a reviewer of the CD version mentioned, that the author has no gift for narration.   The mix of Buddhism and psychology, two subjects I usually find interesting, doesn't work, at least as far as I got - two tapes on - before I stopped listening.   The Buddhism focused on the author's near obsession with the Zen tea ceremony, which she describes in a way that makes it sound about as spiritual as operating a Mister Coffee. Whatever she gets out of the tea ceremony, she is not communicating it here. And if you are not fascinated with the Zen tea ceremony this book may not be for you.   Meanwhile, the psychological bits are mostly based on case studies of the type that an old newspaperman used to call the "suspicious anecdote." The author always seems to be a heroic therapist, and the patient seems to attain Buddha-like insights within minutes of their encounter. The stories sound like outtakes from a "can-you-top-this" contest in the bar of a psychotherapists' convention.   In the end, listening to this book felt like having my teeth cleaned by a well-meaning but ham-handed dental hygienist. The best part was the Zen silence after I stopped listening.     
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 FIVE STARS, NOT TWO....F.F. Bruce is well known and respected far and wide for his honesty as a Christian scholar and apologist. This slim volume, 123 pgs, is true to form despite that as a Christian Bruce has a pre-ordained agenda to defend. Consider his painful honesty in this statement: "indeed, it may be we know nothing certain about the teacher into whose mouth the narrative is put; the story of Jesus as it has come down to us may be myth or legend, but the teaching ascribed to him, whether he was actually responsible for it or not, has a value all its own." How unlike the rabid fundamentalists who insist ever word is inspired of God, error free. He touches on many problem areas, but unfortunately does not develop them as he could have. Some areas not touched are more developed in his contributions to the book "Hard Sayings of the Bible", but even there, some elementary obvious problems, such as the two differing birth accounts of Jesus in Matthew vs. Luke, or the differences in the passion week account of John vs. the synoptics are mentioned in passing, but not developed. "The N.T. documents;are they reliable" thus introduces one to the existence of such areas of controversy, but that is all. It does more to establish the historicity of the accounts as being in the general time period they claim, particularly via Luke, with no less than eighteen historic contemporaries to challenge the reader to test the account validity. He reviews traditional Christian arguments to establish the accounts reliability such as what caused Paul to take such a direct about face from intense persecution to being a foremost leader in Christianity, yet acknowledging in the same chapter that Paul, whose writings are prior to the gospels, is only mentioned in Luke/Acts. Thus while doing a good job to establish the historicity of the New Testament accounts, Bruce also does not hedge on the internal problems of consistency of theology and event accuracy in reporting. He also acknowledges Mark being almost entirely incorporated into Matthew & Luke, and the Q document. Very recommendable due to it's honesty, and a good book for those beginning the subject, but lacking in development in looking at some of the specific events mentioned.    
 After reading the first book in the homecoming saga I was fairly dissapointed in The Call To Earth. The 2nd book seemed to lack any real substance. There really is nothing going on, it seems to me that Card made this book as a filler. There are a bunch of useless characters and useless events, this book could easily be condensed to around 200 pages and be much better than it is now. Personally I did enjoy it, although I have to admit more then a few times I dosed off reading the book and skipped a few pages simply to try to stop the boredom. I am hoping this book is a build up to the 3rd book in the series, if not Im afraid the rest of the saga may be just as bad if nto worse 
 This is very expensive for what is essentially hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. which would cost the average person about 3 dollars. 
 The plot was OK and Tomei charming and delightful, but to say I was not taken by the appearance and performance of Downey falls within the department of understatement. My antipathy grew to where I ceased watching with the movie about 75% completed. Some one of these days, I may watch the remainder to see Tomei.  GV 
 After being a long time Isley fan, I treated myself to what seemed like a greatest hits DVD.  Ron's voice was ok, but just no energy, very ho hum like.  Ernie played ok, but for a live show, I thought he would of ripped the strings like on Who's that Lady or Summer Breeze.  Maybe there's an older DVD concert of them out there? 
 I usually enjoy her books but this one was truly disappointing. Such a silly plot. I finished it but kept saying to myself..."Why not just toss this one?" 
 These glasses were a bit of a disappointment.  The convenience was out weighed by the uncomfortable fit - they were really snug with no possibility of adjustment.  And actually they were annoying with how they hung when not in use.  Great idea but maybe some "fine tuning" would help...like a more flexible strap rather than the plastic frame just being super long to go around your neck. 
 Yes, this book was good in that it seemed to accurately portray the breakdown of a family when one of its members actually "breaks down".    However, it is an extremely depressing book in that no one seems to get any better.  Angie floats around, mostly in a paranoid state, in and out of hospitals, group homes and her own home.  Luke leaves college, leaves his girlfriend, drifts around for a while, then gets back with his girlfriend and goes back home (doing what, I'm not sure - the book wasn't clear on that).  Pieter keeps playing his cello and wallowing in self pity.  And Jordana never fully copes or even comes to term with Angie's illness.  She is also drifting.  This may be reality, but it is an extremely depressing reality.  I have read "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and loved it.  This book is NOTHING like "Cuckoo Nest". 
 i didnt like clue chronicles i sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out, i got so far and couldnt get any further. this was a waste of my money, if i could sell it i would, i like the regular clue better, that is why i bought this i thought it was something like the old one, when i seen it wasnt, i thought this might be fun, but as i was playing it i hated it more and more. i have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and i end up in the same spot and cant get no where else. i hate i 
 I don't have anything against gay people, but this album makes me feel borderline homosexual. I like to think of myself as a pretty straight guy, but I can't feel this way when the whole album sounds like one long vogue commercial. Not once did I hear a good dance beat or anything that could be called a decent romantic song. I could have enjoyed this album more if barney himself sang the songs. Michael needs to retire and stop living in the 80's. He has a good voice but not good enough to save all the corny lyrics and yester-year dance beats.  Save your money and don't waste it on this garbage. 
 For wrestling fans it is obvious that an autobiography by this legend is a must for the collection. But what is missing from his chapter on WCW leaves a big gap that cannot be ignored and ultimately detracts from the work.  There was an angle aired during the Ron Simmons v Lex Luger "press conference" for the heavyweight title match where Lex uses a disgusting racial slur to draw heat (of the cheapest kind). The slur actually made it on the air on cable, but was cut when shown through syndication.  Watts spends several pages on why he felt Simmons deserved the push to wear the championship strap, but fails to mention anything about the angle used that perhaps was the worst ever from a major promotion in a business not known for good taste.   Simply, did Watts have a hand in creating the script? If he did, why did he feel he needed to fuel the fire of racisim to gain heat for the match? And, if Watts did not have anything to do with the angle, he certainly would have a recollection and opinion the issue.   Watts remembers conversations he had with wrestlers like Sting concerning the use of steroids and has opinions on a wide-range of subjects, hence not addressing this issue really questions the validity of the entire book.  The most moving section is excerpts of letters from young people when Watts was running the UWF. The words coming from youngsters with oftentimes terminal illnesses is very powerful. It shows the impact that wrestlers back when they worked territories for significant periods of time. They truly were seen as stars like pro baseball and football players & not like the cartoon characters that are seemingly pushed today.  I simply wish Watts did not suffer amnesia on an issue that defined not only his management of WCW, but himself as a person.             
 I've read great reviews about this book so I finally bought it because I could not get it at my local library. Never ever finished the book - it was god-awful. Badly written, incoherent story - it jumped around - JUST PLAIN BAD.. 
 The wrong item was mailed to me. I checked the order after I recieved the item to make sure it wasn't a mistake on my part, and it wasn't. I recieved an armband for an iPod nano and I ordered an armband for an iPod video. Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back. 
 THIS BOOK WAS SO BADLY WRITTEN THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO WAIST YOUR TIME READING A REVIEW ON IT. RUUUUUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN... GO ON WITHOUT ME! 
   Phil Sheridan was a sociopath who wanted to murder the battered remnants of Lee's army just before the surrender. His bloodlust was later satisfied when he was turned loose on the American Indian. Pure genocide. I'm not sure we have ever produced uglier little man in our 400 years in this hemisphere. 
 All Mr. Webb has proven is that some prejudices are more deeply intrenched in our protean cultures than others.  Prejudices against women and the accepted practice of enslaving people were somewhat quicker (ironic as it is to use that word) to evaporate in the light of truth and human dignity.  Every thoughtful Christian I know firmly believes that homophobia will go the same way as slavery and the subjugation of women.  Mr. Webb presents no evidence to the contrary.  All he does say is that it is his opinion, and the opinion of his circle, which he mistakenly takes for universal truth.  On the other side of the debate, John McNeill, John Boswell, Fr. Daniel Helminiak, Robin Scoggs, and many more deeply spiritually wise writers have far stronger arguments than Mr. Webb's.  This is all unfortunate because in other respects he is more or less a logical thinker and an exemplary writer 
 It is hard to believe that this book came from National Geographic. The lack of useful maps is astonishing. This book is basically worthless to any birder as it presents very little information that is no already in any field guide. The book which is 480 pages has only 41 maps covering only 112 birds. OK there are also the standard thumb nail size maps found in any field guide book in the back of the book but this is a "Reference Atlas" from National Geographic!! Some of the choices for the full page maps are rather odd. Full page North American maps for the ranges of Wagtails, Brambling, Eurasian Tree Sparrow and one for the Sky Lark with only 4 dots on it. Another is separate facing full pages one for Lewis's Woodpecker and one for the Red Bellied Woodpecker even though their ranges hardly over lap. While several maps show migration routes only a few show date lines for movement. For those thinking that a very good choice would be range, migration and times for Wood  Warbles look else where as there is only two maps one for the Blackpoll and another for "Eastern" warblers neither with date lines.  Don't think at the text makes up for the lack of maps as it is only the very basic generalization on bird families with very little individual species information, if you have a good field guide you already have this. But there are a lot of pretty pictures, you know the type non birder editors like but are of little use for identification purposes. As you can see this book is aimed at non-birders and coffee tables. It is such a shame as National Geographic could have made a standard reference guide for the ages if they had just stuck to maps. We will give it 2 stars for being pretty 
 As a caregiver with two Alzheimer's victims, I found the book to be a how to do little right and treat the patient like a mindless doll.  I prefer a real world approach to AD not one from fantasy land

 As a student of Church History and Denominations, and as an author and teacher on the same subject, I honestly have to say the "Complete Guide to Christian Denominatins..." is NOT anywhere near being a complete "guide".  In review of this book, and three others on the same topic (which includes my own yet to be published book) - Rhodes book has the least amount of information (only 105 denominations, compared to 179 in the National Council of Churches book, 193 in The Handbook of Denominations (Frank Mead/Samuel Hill) and 227 on my book (Guide to Denominations - Robert Stearns).  Further - many of the denominations are mis-identified as to the family they belong to, and the Churches of God (Reformation Theology group of churches) totally omitted.  Very limited in statistics.   The interesting feature, however, was the lay out and the quick reference "bullets".  Robert H Stearns, Reviewe 
 During fourth of july vacation, I had a chsance to see an old college friend, who is a vice president for a large computer hard drive firm... he was showing offf his new Toyota hybrid when we began talking about the market forces, which interfered with large companies responding to the emerging needs and changes in the marketplace.  I was fascinated as he explained to me the difficulty of an older company attempting to incorporate new technologies, while maintaining a profit margin necessary to please investors.  It was during this explanation, He recommended "The Inovator's Dilemma".  All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD. I can only surmize that there must be another book by the same name 
 God, this book was awful! Not just the story, it was the construction that turned me off. The storyline is weak and the writing immature. Characters seem to sprout and wither with all the imagination of a photocopier. There is nary a connection between personalities and their responses to events. I can go on but I guess I need to be more concrete.  A sprite introduced within the first 45 pages suddenly develops ventriloquistic abilities for just one scene. Nary a mention before or later of that ability. While it is the prerogative of the author, a little more finesse would have been nice.  There is an unnecessary page or two of pontification before each of the five parts that comprise the book. For a work so shallow in its content, this essentially has a "insult-to-injury" aura.  Guenhwyvar is totally wasted/domesticated in the book. There was some evocation of majesty associated with the panther in the first book. In this third book, he had all the majesty of a tomcat. Also unbelievable is a battle towards the end where the panther is unable to dispose of the pet dog of the bad guy.  Then there's Montolio, what can I say....for a couple of chapters I thought this might be a promising character, especially with the blind archer bit. He even defeats the great Drizzt in battle, seemingly teaching him a "valuable" lesson. Then dies a few months later of old age. C'mon!!  With this book I give up on Robert Salvatore, never mind the ringing endorsement given to him by Margaret Weis in the 'Introduction' (strike one for her) 
 This is a review of the Avery 3279 Ink Jet Dark T-Shirt Transfers. But I wouldn't be surprised to discover that the rest of the stuff they make is ALSO junk.  This stuff is EXPENSIVE....over $15 for five sheets from Office Depot. I had put in a brand new ink cartridge just a couple of days prior (HP PSC 1410 Inkjet)  and it was working fine on normal paper. Read all the directions carefully and more than once. First time, the paper CUT OFF the top portion of the image.....sure, blame it on the printer; but if so, why didn't normal paper do this? Second time, it printed really wimpy and hazy grey....yet I had set the printer to use MAXIMUM dpi! I thought, "OK, maybe it will darken from the heat of the iron. Set the kitchen timer, ironed it exactly as instructed....and it is STILL a sickening hazy grey instead of the crisp black I wanted! AND some of the darkness of the fabric below is showing through the white portions. Oh yes...it is INCREDIBLY difficult to peel off the backing...you do end up having to tear a portion of the design you create, pretty much ruining it.  So....wasted time shopping for this. Overpaid for the product. Wasted HOURS prepping the image. And now I have a ruined tote bag that can't be replaced. Avery scum, I HATE YOU 
 Admittedly, the mechanical execution is a bit weak but so what. If you love the little critter and get a kick out of him, it really doesn't matter.  Of course, in the spirit of Scrat, it sort of makes sense that he doesn't work quite right.. 
 I bought this as a gift for my nephew. Unfortunately it didn't work when it arrived, but fortunately my sister in law was able to take it to a local discovery store and exchange it for one that worked fine 
 This is all we need - yet another book telling us how great we Scots are. Recently, we've had Hermann's "How the Scots Invented the Modern World," Buchan's "Capital of the Mind: How Edinburgh Changed the World," and Lamont's "When Scotland Ruled the World: The Story of the Golden Age of Genius, Creativity and Exploration." Enough already!!!  This pathological need to hear our praises continually sung and to have the sound of our backs being patted forever ringing in our ears is pathetic. Bruce's new book takes this national self-obsession mania to new heights by taking a leaf out of the Scottish Rugby Association's book and granting Scottishness to anyone even remotely related, cobber. Thus we are told to our eternal and insufferable conceit that a fat American pill popper and donut chomper who had a few hits with cover versions was ... gasp! ... Scottish, because his name was Presley. "Awl-right!!!" as Neil Kinnock (another great ersatz Scot) once proclaimed. Oh, and while you're going on about Neil Armstrong of the famous Borders name, what about Louis Armstrong? Or Diana Ross for that matter!?   Instead of burying their noses in a badly compressed pile of laurels, Scots should sit up and look around at their garbage infested streets, grafitti disfigured walls; the constant vandalism, drunkeness, and violence that make their living environment intolerable; and the cozy political cronyism, high taxes, and public service inefficiency that make all these pats on the back sound so damnably hollow.   Scots might have once made a mark in the world, but now Scotland's just a land of obese, junkie, drunken neds, who cannae e'en kick a ba', and their dysfunctional parents and siblings. Pride doesn't even enter into it anymore.   
 Well, this guy I have been hearing for several months among the on-line King fandom groups I am a member to, and me thinks that he is worth to check out---I go through his backcatalogue, seeing that aside from the Girl Next Door, almost identified with his name, there are a few more pieces which are highly praised...then me sees a story collection and thinking that short stories will be a good starting point for a new author to prevent any disappointment which rather cloaks on you with doorstoppers- so me orders it from Amazon UK, gets the book and starts to read it- then asks what the hell is happening?  Yes, me agrees Ketchum's writing is good- he is close to Stephen King and Peter Straub (you like his characteris- as is always in King books, characters have a life outside the pages of the stories) yes his prose is flowing (thank God there is another author better than the syrupy Dean Koontz in horror/ thriller segment)but what is lacking is substance- I know short story is a format of short tales, as its name suggests but should they be this short? Should every theme be a a story? take the story of father and son: The purpose? The excitement factor? The guessing factor? The building factor? No, no ,no It is as if Jack Ketchum, while jumping between house tasks, sat down on his way from kitchen to dining hall to bathroom and wrote a story each time. There are so many stories that it seems like a heaven at the first glance but you can easily cut three-fourth of them because they are...too pointless for the sake of heaven.   some of the stories -Rifle,the Visitor and Megan's Low and Snakes- are true chillers and effective stories -another very good one one wtihout a chilling factor is the one that involves squirrel hunting but I cannot remember its name- It is as if the longer the story gets, the more effective Ketchum is- and then of course there is the Closing Time the longest story -almost a novella (taking intou account the length of stories in the book) but it is one of the most pointless things I have ever read in my life. And I cannot help but think that if I was to write more than 30 stories I think at least three or four of them would be effective- just like in case of Jack Ketchum  If it is not for Ketchum's prose, I would completely disregard him but it appears that his novels should be more effective. Skeleton Crew was the first book I laid my hands and devoured from Stephen King and it turned me into a semi-rabid fan- Night Shift was even better...But this is fully contrary in Ketchum's case: I am sorry to say that Ketchum loses me in his short form and his first impression on me is that he is not as creative as I think- just like Dean Koontz, he puts onto paper whatever comes to his mind- but thank God his prose saves him to the nnnth degree where Koontz cannot hold a candle in this respect (and thank God Ketchum, like King, equally treats animas, you do not feel there are only  smart cute golden retrievers around the globe)  Skeleton Crew made a score for King, making me a constant reader, but Ketchum should try once more (or several more times) As usual my top three modern horror masters remain the same:  1. Stephen King 2. Peter Straub 3. Clive Barker  But the fourth place changes: Ketchum effectively pushes Dan Simmons and Robert McCommon one rank below:  4. Jack Ketchum 5. Dan Simmons 6. Robert McCommo 
 We were happy with the gift baskets that were delivered. However the company only has one distribution center in California, which is obviously not efficient to deliver to the East Coast.  Despite the company's ambitions to become a national company, they are not willing to pony up the money to get additional distribution facilities outside of California.  This maybe great if you live in California. However I live in Florida and I ordered on December 22 and my basket did not arrive until January 4th. I think that would be unacceptable in anyone's view, espescially since giving a gift basket can be time-sensitive.  Until this company gets with the program and gets other distribution facilities I would stay away unless you want to wait two weeks for a simple basket to be delivered. 
 This book provides an acceptable introduction to some of the philosophies which have influenced Western culture from Socrates to Sartre. It provides a brief background of each man and his most influential works, most of which are still available. However, I feel that there is a liberal partiality towards the treatment of each philosopher's work. For example, the entries on most "Christian" philosophers are shorter than that of the skeptics and atheists. The works which dealt with Christianity in general are either tersely handled, or completely ignored. When a theist theory is introduced it is dismantled in an unapologetic manor which will lead a reader who is not well versed in the subject at hand to adopt a similar, and biased, idea. Also, when a skeptical theory is discussed it is shown in a favorable light, or it is glossed over as being something it is not. For example, in the section on Friedrich Nietzsche, the author propounded that Nietzsche did not disapprove of Christianity, but felt that if was in fact an institution which is of value to some individuals. However, in the conclusion of Nietzsche's final work "The Antichrist" he states, ". . I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge, for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough,--I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race. . . that the greatest plague to man has been Christianity...". This author's bias is telling of the theme of the entire book, therefore I do not recommend it as an introduction to the subject 
 its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it 
 What Tedd Tripp has to say may be true, but he says it without warmth, humor or compassion.  If you're looking for a good book on parenting from a Christian perspective, pick up a book by Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Kevin Leman, or Gary Chapman

 The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.  
 I purchased this book to learn HOW TO ATTACH CLASPS. Well, there are NO PICTURES to go along with the step by step instructions. I am a total NOVICE at this, and with all the great reviews I figured this would be the ONE BOOK to get ... no. I still have no idea how to modify a necklace on a leather cord to attach a clasp. If anyone can offer any help, I would appreciate it. But I would not buy this book if you don't know how to attach clasps 
 I'm not sure who wrote the positive reviews here, but I can tell you as a student using this book that it is among the worst I've ever been stuck with and most of my classmates seem to agree.  The concepts are made much more difficult than they should be by poor writing.  The authors jump around constantly, use new terminology at times before introducing it, and provide examples that are inadequate in helping to solve the problems at the end of the chapter.  Stylistically, the writing is very bland and sure to put you to sleep.  The first sentence of the book is "This is a book about signals and systems."  Sure, this book may cover all of the core concepts involved in signal processing, but trying to make sense of it when you don't already have a background in the subject is quite a challenge.  After reading the chapters, we were unable to solve most of the problems in the book until given the answers were given to us.  I've dealt with bad textbooks before, but this one tops them all.  Needless to say, it was very frustrating experience and I can't say I recommend this book 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 What do you get when two of the most visionary science fiction writers of modern times combine forces to produce a novel of the near future?  In this case you get pure and utter drivel.  I picked this book up because Clarke and Baxter have been favorite writers of mine for years, but they obviously do not work well together.  First, a warning.  I am going to reveal plot points in this review, so don't read on if you don't want to see spoilers.  This story is filled with holes.  It revolves around the invention of a technology that lets people view any location both now and any time in the past.  Yet one of the first major plot points totally disregards this capability and sets up one of the characters to be framed for a crime she didn't commit.  Other things are merely implausible, like a worldwide obsession with history suddenly emerging after the technology is introduced.  There are also long, long, unnecesary stretches of exposition detailing, for instance, the true life of Jesus Christ, or the last work of Fermat.  I know that these two authors are capable of telling good stories, but in this book they have apparently forgotten the writer's maxim to show, not tell.  Some of the story seems completely random, without connection or purpose.  For instance, one of the main characters is revealed dramatically as a clone.  A mass mind emerges out of the wormhole viewer technology for no apparent reason.  The lead female character dies in between chapters and is barely referred to again.  Another intelligent race is discovered to have evolved on the earth tens of millions of years ago, and been wiped out by the collision that gave birth to the moon.  And, in a final unncessary twist, in the very last pages the main character dies and is resurrected hundreds of years in the future, but given nothing to do or say.  Overall, I can't recommend reading this book, much less buying it.  Save up and get the books these authors have written individually, and skip this sad mishmash 
 Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
 I feel compelled to write a review to warn people that this is a pretty disturbing book.  I thought the back cover was completely misleading.  The book is about cat death - tons and tons of cats die in horrible ways.  The descriptions are graphic.  There is not a normal relationship between a woman and her cat wherein the woman loves and grieves the cat - it is written with complete emotional distance.  If the author wasn't famous for other work I can't imagine any publisher publishing this book.  Awful doesn't do it justice.  If you want to read about cats dying, written in a completely dispassionate, matter-of-fact, "oh-well" way go for it.  Otherwise, SKIP THIS BOOK 
 I have read three of Dave and Pete's other books and thought those were so much better.  This book is supposed to be the first in a series of three books about getting to be a "level 3" investor, someone that earns $5k to $50k monthly on a passive basis.  I did learn a few things from this book, and found it to be motivating, but as a Dave and Pete fan, I was very disappointed.  The book is just a huge advertisement for their mentorship program.  The book is from the perspective of a few new mentorship students and their experience at the first intensive training session.    If you have read any of Dave and Pete's other books, don't bother with this one.  If you haven't read any ofDave and Pete's books, I would definately recommend them.  Just not this one.   
 I purchased this vacuum based upon how it was rated by Consumer Reports.  What a disappointment!  It is supposed to work well on hard surfaces.  It simply shoots out the back what it picks up in the front.  A total bummer since my house is all tile!  I would not recommend this vacuum 
 Don't buy this here - it is selling for $49.99 at Best Buy (bestbuy.com). Wait until they lower the price on Amazon 
 the remaining of the REAL Mercury 7(Grissom who died in the fire before this book came out) called this book "fiction" and that Wolfe took too much license with this story. Especially how Grissom is protrayed in whole "hatch" issue. 
 My main interest in reading the book was for the information about the Nazi fascination with the Occult.  I was hoping for something as stimulating as Mel Gordon's HANUSSEN: HITLER'S JEWISH CLAIRVOYANT.  I was greatly disappointed.  Christopher Hale's HIMMLER'S CRUSADE doesn't really deliver what it promises.  Hale basically pooh-poohs anything connected with the occult, asserts that only Himmler took such notions seriously (but was indulged by those seeking favors from him) and then moves on to other matters.  The book draws no real conclusion other than "Nazis were evil," which it pounds repeatedly throughout the book.  (I think I knew that before I even started reading the book.)  Hale never seems to be sure of exactly which story he is telling.  For a while it seems as though the book is about Schaeffer, who led the expedition, then toward the end, it drops him altogether and starts giving detailed biographical information about other members of the expedition (and the people with whom THEY interacted).   The author goes off on lots of tangents, giving unessential details about minor figures and events that had little bearing on the main story.  After having invested several weeks in reading the book, I am not sure what the point of it was.    The most interesting parts of the book were those that took place in Tibet, but the trip to Tibet actually takes up only about half the book.  The rest is a long-winded recounting of the rise and fall of Nazism.  It seems to me that here we have yet another book written by someone completely lacking a literary sensibility.  The author, Christopher Hale, is a British TV documentarist.  This book is an appendix to his TV show.  I found it very difficult reading.  In addition to its lack of focus, I just don't think Hale is very comfortable with the printed word.  There are pages and pages wherein it seems he is giving verbal descriptions of documentary film footage.  Perhaps his TV show was interesting, but the book was a chore to read.  In addition, the author has this maddening habit of inserting inflammatory opinions into his narrative, apropos of nothing and lacking supporting evidence.  Several times throughout the book, the author, a Briton, makes outlandish parallels between America and Nazi Germany, which he doesn't bother to back up (because he can't).  Perhaps one can get away with this in a TV documentary, but not in a book, where the reader can back up and say, "Wait a minute.  That's a bunch of crap.  Where is the evidence are you basing that statement on?"    The book is also rife with typographical errors (some of them giving an unintentional double entendre when for example "role" is spelled "roll") and misusages of words.  It appears to have not been edited at all.  I give this book one and a half stars, but let's round it off to two just for the research the author has done.  (His bibliography is probably of a lot more use than the book.)  I just wish he had been able to put all this research into a more coherent form and told it in a way that was more comprehensible and more interesting 
 As a long time fan of Paula Deen, I was looking forward to another wonderful cookbook.  Not so for this one.  It has repeat recipes and if you're a regular of her show, many of the recipes have been on the show.  It has wonderful family stories, (which I don't need for a cookbook), and the layout and red font color is not cook friendly.  Overall, it was not what I would have expected in a Paula Deen cookbook and therefore I rate this one a big flop!  How many times can you publish gooey butter recipes 
 I have to say I agree with some of the other reviews here, that this collection of poetry by "Rumi" is in reality modern American poetry by someone drawing only very loosely on Rumi's work. It is rather a stretch to call it a translation! If one were cynical, one might think the large number of books from this "translator" indicates merely a money-making exercise.  Much better collections/translations can be found, like Maryam Mafi's and Azima Melita Kolin's, but I would personally recommend Juliet Mabey's Rumi: A Spiritual Treasury. This is not only a gorgeous book to look at, but more importantly, both its selection and English rendition demonstrate a deftness of touch that make you think you are reading something very close to the original sentiment. A rare achievement 
 This woman sounds like she was very bitter about the entire experience. Quite honestly, it's people like her who contribute to the many problems of the greek system in general by not speaking up when these things are going  on. I will admit that she did offer some solutions. My undergrad greek  experience was nothing like what she described but  these can vary from  campus to campus. One thing I really didn't like is that she gave away  which house she belonged to. If she wanted the readers to know which  sorority she belonged to, she should have just said so and not use examples  of hazing rituals for us to figure it out. I suggest if you want to read  this book, borrow it from your local library and don't waste your money 
 to try and re create NWA with the west coast best is a good idea but it cant be done. The sound of NWA was so raw loud and straight ghetto that this remake serves as a sorry re mak 
 I used to love Iris Johansen's books esp. her Eve Duncan books. The last few though have been terrible. On the Run was the final straw, she's lost me as a reader. I read about 100pgs and gave up. The plot was so dumb I can't believe she got someone to publish it. 
 So I finally got around to watching "Michael Moore Hates America", the DVD that was financed by Richard Mellon Scaife, with the help of a few right-wing think tanks. Also appearing is Penn Jillette, a rabid psychiatrist, some NRA staffers, pundits, more think-tankers, and a number of pissed-off vets.  While Wilson comes off as tolerant (backhandedly) with regards to Moore's techniques, when it comes to his ideas it's almost completely one-sided in that that nearly everything is a rebuttal of the man's social commentary. There's a lot of well-balanced, average centrist people that get innocently sucked into this mess, but the number of instances that hint that maybe, just maybe Moore's got a few points in his films (as opposed to everything being mere alarmist rhetoric manufactured by taking things out of context) are exceedingly few.  Center-right moderates are likely to feel soothed and smug by the whole presentation, so the movie caters to them very well. By far most of the examples criticized here involve Bowling For Columbine, with only a few from "Roger And Me" and none from "Fahrenheit 911" although the movie was released. In one scene Wilson attempts to push-poll a woman who saw "Fahrenheit" the day before: "How would knowing that Mr. Moore's selective editing of the facts in Fahrenheit in order to support false conclusions affect your enjoyment of the film?"  On a social level, the film is a veritable ode to Republican framing, i.e.: There Is No Economic Divide, Corporations Don't Hurt Us, We Can All Be Successful If We Work Hard Enough, Criticizing the Leadership means you Hate America, etc., etc... and oh yeah, one actually guy goes on to say that we don't need Michael Moore because we already get fair perspectives on all sides from the major news media, amazingly lumping present-day Fox, CNN and pre-merger CBS-era Walter Cronkite together in the same sentence.  Ultimately, the man (Michael Wilson) fails to get his interview. 
 The most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content, but, based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers, that most people actually believe this drivel. How can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed? The answer is that we cannot. I will not bother to go through a detailed criticism, not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it, but because, in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in, no one would believe it. Today, the "truth" depends much more on one's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence. 
 The title of this book is unfortunately misleading.  If you believe, as I do, that "Web Services" has something to do with SOAP (or more specifically, nuSOAP or other PHP-specific library) then prepare to be disappointed if you buy this book!  The closest thing you will find is a short discussion of the Amazon API and Google translation services, a slim 24 page chapter out of the entire 400+ page book.  These are both already documented online. The rest is an intermediate-level discussion of common PHP applications, which are addressed as well (if not better) in a number of other books...  Not recommended.      Postscript: Based on the ratings for this review, I felt it necessary to add the following clarifying comments:  This book is a decent introduction to general PHP web programming.  However (and most PHP newbies would not know this), "Web Services" is a VERY specific programming term used to describe some relatively advanced concepts, e.g. Remote Procedure Calls between hardware-agnostic servers.    So what we have here is a book that explicitly claims to provide some specific, advanced programming knowledge.  THE BOOK DOES NOT DELIVER ON THE PROMISE IMPLIED BY ITS TITLE!  No matter how good an introductory book this is, readers should be warned that they will not come away with any increased knowledge of "Web Services".  Caveat Emptor 
 I have little to add to what's already been said by other reviewers other than I can't believe she seriously holds these views.  I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven.  You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.  She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want.  Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year 
 I picked this book off the library shelf because I like a good mystery, but this seems to be a book about foxhunting with a sparse mystery story added as an afterthought.  It was disappointing in many respects:  hollow characters, poor writing, unrealistic dialogue.  I haven't read any other Rita Mae Brown, but I'm a little confused by her popularity.  If this is representative of her work, she's not a writer 
 If I had read this before the 2000 election. I would have learned that Americans want a leader that posseses honesty, compassion, morals, and the courage of his convictions. I should have at least pretended to posses some of these qualities. Bush stole Florida in 2000 and Ohio in '04, if you don't believe me just ask John Kerry. And where did I come up with that stupid imaginary lockbox stuff anyway 
 Intersting style of writing as previouse reviewer indicated and at the same time obviouse he had no idea of what an option was. For anyone with the slightest knowlege of options it becomes apparent that the main purpose of this book is to get one to purchase Mr Groenke's option software. With out it which he constantly referes to, his formulia's would result in endless hours of tedious calculations. After spending $29 on this book and finding it is really a primar for his software would be disapointing to anyone trying to get a basic understanding of how selling options works. His software may be great and worth the money but its a little misleading to promote this book as a stand alone. I'm not a reviewer, just someone that buys and mostly sells options and can't figure how anyone could give this 5 stars, or buy this book without understanding you really need his software to get any benifit from the book. That of course assumes your not a proffeser sitting in an office somwhere as opposed to really utilizing options 
 This book was required reading for a class on children's literature.  So, naturally, I was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there.  The beginning was quite exceptional.  I even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening.  We were about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's female body parts.  Due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children's literature.  We set the book down and did not finish it.  If you are looking for good children's literature that COMPLETELY steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this book will be a let down.  Sad, because up until that point, the writing was quite good.  
 This is one of the worst textbooks i have ever used. The book uses lame metaphors. The style of writing is also horrible. It is very hard to understand and has a lot of "fluff" information. I do not suggest any AP US history students to read this for the AP exam 
 Another badly-researched fantasy. Wolfe may understand the principles of modern, Neopagan magic (she seems to) but she clearly doesn't understand the basics of Celtic Pagan symbolism. Misleading and innacurate 
 I loved "Tailchaser's Song" by Tad Williams (although I did read it as a teen) and I like cats, so I thought I'd try this cat-character fantasy novel.  I really did not like it.  I read it to the end because I kept thinking "maybe it will get better and it will all have been worth it".  But no.  The main cat character was very juvenile and annoying.  He is a young cat, so maybe his characteristics were "realistic", but it was still annoying.  The whole "wild roads" concept was extremely strange and just not "believable" fantasy.  A fantasy world needs to be built up in such a way that the reader is drawn in and finds the world believable and compelling.  This was not the case for me.  I scanned a few of the reviews and several people seemed to really like the book, so maybe it is a "loved it" or "hated it" book.  I am still searching for a quality "Tailchaser's Song" or "Watership Down" type book.  I would not recommend this book 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 Disappointed that my preschooler will not be able to use this for years.  Without cues to turn the page she cannot read it independently 
 This is not a comprehensive book on the field of Urban Design. Although this is obvious from the subtitle one is left with dissapointment. Aside from an interesting collection of cases studies you really don't get the complexity and timeless cross-section of this field that is having a renaissance now. None of the current trends are mentioned nor do they get any strong coverage (new urbanism/trasnurbanism/reurbanism/everyday urbanism/splintered urbanism/complexity urbanism) nor does the historical element comes through. Generaly good written book but too much of a sallad bowl without a proper structure and philosophy. Not a good tool for teaching. If you want top of the pops book in this field go to D.Grahame Shane's Recombinant Urbanism. For me it was astonishing how little space was given to new urbanism, the leading urban design theory and practice today 
 cheap and splashes water all over the place.  noisy to 
 Mr. Chandra's creation, from the title onwards, is a ruefully falsified description of the city of Bombay, one of the most banal and dirtiest cities in Asia, as is well known.  The author's words and ideas apply to any reasonably peaceful, affluent Latin or South American city, which can given scale and space to the fanciful stories contained in this collection.  Bombay has no such capacity;  it only breaks down people into miniatures of themselves, to the level of the grim and the persistent human defecation abound in public places.  Frankly, very few Indian people would bestow Bombay its own book.  They know how dehumanizing the city has become, and perhaps always was.  It is perhaps the most emblematic Asiatic city.  Read Mr. Chandra's book, but know that it contains no truth 
 good movie, bad copy!  I ordered it because it was cheap.  However, picture quality is POOR; fuzzy, washed-out, blurry.  It looks like it's recorded in superlongplay.  The shortness of the tape would seem to confirm this 
 I was shocked to see Tchaikovsky's classic danced exclusively by males.  One reviewer felt that the result was a "human"-- not merely  "romantic"-- ballet.  I saw it as a travesty of Swan Lake.  We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire.  A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity.  The superb pas de deux by Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky in the other selection from Swan Lake did not remove the bad taste left by Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler 
 It is my good fortune to be in a college program aimed at the adult learner.  I had heard much about today's college atmosphere molding many of our young people into politically correct animals and was glad that type of teaching was not reaching me.  Unfortunately it found me in a Business Ethics course which uses this book.  Messrs Shaw and Barry, in a writing style that is very familiar to me, do a rather unethical job in an attempt to bring you around to their point of view.  In the book they cite single sources with assurances that others must feel the same, use the famed, 'many have said' frame of mind, and introduce each chapter with one of societies ills, the entire purpose of which seems only to be to cast a negative light preparing the reader to dislike something that follows.  In a specific example, a section on the natural right to property (p 146, 2nd paragraph) in a part of the chapter that is supposed to show the moral justifications of capitalism has a sentence that reads as follows:  "Although we are no longer permitted to own other people, we are certainly free to own a variety of other things, from livestock to stock certificates, from our own home to a whole block of apartment buildings."  I was so bothered by this one sentence that I had to put the book down for an hour.  There were no statements on slavery in the beginning of the chapter and after looking there was nothing that would indicate a disclaimer about not being able to own people in the entire book.  Yet here was a statement in a section that was supposed to show the morality of capitalism that gets shot down in the second sentence.  If this were the only example of questionable writing in the book I would not have written this review.  Another section that was supposed to define capitalism spent more that half the section discussing socialism.  Much of this book seems to be designed to incite a person's emotions.  As an adult learner it seems silly to me to attempt to coerce my viewpoint in such a manner.  My open mind is better reached through logical discussion of facts and views rather than this unethical attempt to work at my underbelly.  I'm insulted and disappointed by the attempt.  What bothers me more is that other students not my age (33) are being influenced or coerced by material of this type in advanced learning institutions.  I'm concerned that these are the types of texts and the professors that teach from them that drive children to throw tofu pies and yell 'shame on you' at officials just for eating meat 
 I really didn't read it as it is too long and does not keep my interest at all.  I have read other books in the past like "Body for Life" and found them very informative and short and to the point.  
 Another lousy cookbook from Martin Yan. The only thing I got out of it was the spicy garlic sauce that I altered to make Chicken with garlic sauce. That sauce recipe was in a recipe with eggs. I couldn't get anything else out of this cook book. I spent some time with it in a book store before I decided to buy it. But I couldn't agree wth many of the recipes in the book. I wonder if anything in his recipes are kitchen tested. I was looking specifically for sauces and there isn't one recipe in this book that I could make to taste like what I wanted, either at a Chinese-American restaurant I have gone to in the 'burbs or a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Or the recipe given I already have another method to make. This one went in the recycle bin along with his Chinatown Cooking one. The adage, "Never trust a skinny chef," applies well to Martin Yan 
 This is by far one of the worst cds I have ever heard. This singer is terrible and should be shot with a very heavy animal tranquilizer. I never was a big fan of grindcore or hardcore so I guess this isn't my cup of tea at all. The drummer is damn good though. He should start another band and leave these guys to play a half empty venue the rest of their lives with the likes of Blood Has Been Shed, Hatebreed, Bleeding through.Don't buy it because it sucks 
 At every turn when I took this book to hawaii I found mistakes in the text, places out of business or not such address. I wasted a lot of time following advice from this book I will never trust a Frommer Guide again. Look elsewhere 
 I liked the first one so I bought.  I'm still not clear on how Darcy stays alive after being in a coma for about a month in the 1800's.  Did they have IV drips back then?  If you can put up with it being totally unrealistic, it's not bad.  
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 This was one of the volumes in the History of the American Cinema series that I was most looking forward to, and while a good book it fails to measure up to the best in the series.  Prince never seems to be able to offer the insight of Cook (in vol. 9) or the mastery of Koszarski (in vol. 3).  I had hoped for more about an era that looms as large in the public imagination as that decade does, yet Prince is unable to meet the challenge 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 I read this book for a graduate level Multicultural Education course.  We were given the option to choose between Sonia Nieto's book or another book.  I blindly chose Nieto's, based on the reviews I read on Amazon.com.  As it turns out, that was a HUGE mistake.  It was one of the hardest books I have ever read! If I were writing my dissertation for my Ph.D. in education, perhaps I would have a better knowledge of the jargon Nieto uses. However, it was a struggle to get through how repetitive she tends to be, as well as deciphering much of her vocabulary.  In the beginning I was having a lot of self-doubt about my ability to read.  As it turns out, nine of the ten classmates who chose this book also suffered the same trouble I had.   On the other hand, Sonia Nieto delivers a great message that all educators should heed. She suggests that educators must continue to be fully dedicated toward accomplishing positive growth in the ongoing battle against educational inequity.  Her bold implications are honest, which leaves the reader wanting to adopt her passion.  And yet, she should find a better editor to make the book more readable 
 Beliavsky et al.'s book is one of the worst chess books I have ever seen.  The book is so poorly laid out that it is difficult to follow the various variations and subvariations.  Otherwise, it is bascially a dump of games and lines that have intrigued the authors, omitting many other lines, and possibilities.  Don't expect to find scintilating commentary either because all the notes are in Informator-speak hieroglyphics.  I have studied chess for over ten years and own over 50 chess books.  This book is one of the worst.  Just run a search on the Two Knights in ChessBase and save your money for a nice dinner or trip to the movies 
 This recording is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered. I admit to having only listened to it for few minutes before giving up, but what a mess of an effort. I am sure that when this was originally broadcast there must have been a narrator. Here it is merely a series of voices and it makes things very difficult indeed. There are also some rather rural accents featured on this recording, making it extremely difficult for an American to follow. This is a well-intended, but ultimately a mess of an attempt to render one of the novels of Dickens into drama. The whole thing seems like someone brought a tape recorder down to the pub on a Friday night and hoped for magic to take place 
 i have a deep appreciation for fine literature and unfortunately this just isn't it. the themes were obvious and irritating.  i found it superficial and thoroughly uninteresting.  None of the characters were fully developed and although extremely short, i found it difficult to complete it 
 I, too, received the lower capacity 49A instead of the promised 49X. Four times! Three by Amazon and once by Target. No amount of explanation by me could persuade them to check that large "49A" on the package (see my image, above) before boxing it and mailing it to me. On the fifth attempt, by phone, Amazon simply refused to try again. Yet, as of today, the product is still offered for sale at the attractive $71.99 price 
 Readers should Just Say No to Omar Tyree's to poorly written novel Just Say No! In his pitiful attempt to chronicle the rise and fall of musician John "Loverboy" Williams Tyree shows us that he hasn't grown as a writer since his debut novel Flyy Girl. The entire novel reads like the first draft of a first year fiction writer's manuscript, not the work of an NAACP Image award-winning author with multiple published titles under his belt. Tyree needs to work on his craft. The quality of his work has declined dramatically over the past few years. Just Say No! falls apart from the first page because Tyree uses the wrong narrative to tell John's story. Telling the story of the main character John "Loverboy" Williams from only the first person perspective of his manager Darin Harmon doesn't allow the story to flow well and doesn't give the reader a clear picture of John. Darin's "voice" just isn't strong enough to tell us who John is and why John should be important to the reader. If Tyree wanted to use a first person narrator "voice" to tell the story, he should have used multiple narrators. The book really needed John's point of view to contrast Darin's perceptions of the events transpiring. It would have been more interesting for readers to "see" John's reaction and feel his experiences to the events transpiring in the novel. Then readers would know what both men are just saying "No" to. Darin's distant point of view prevents us from getting to know the supporting characters also. People like Tangela, Big Joe, Tony, The Two Scoops Singers and Sister Williams don't become three-dimensional because Darin doesn't know them intimately as John does. Readers don't get a sense of who they are and why they had an impact on John's life. In Darin's eyes they pop in and out of John's life with no proper introduction or a final exit until John's funeral. (SPOILER).  Tyree tries to use Music as a plot/symbolic device, but fails miserably. The songs sprinkled throughout the novel break up the already slow pace of the book and disrupt the flow of the flatly written prose. He also tries to use John's sexual escapades and drug use as an attempt to develop John's character and show the change in his relationship with Darin. Neither plot device clearly shows the reader how stardom is effecting John in a negative fashion because John isn't telling his own story. The reader gets no sense of depth from Tyree's writing; characters are "floating in a vacuum" throughout the entire story. His paragraphs don't have enough detail to make clear images in the reader's imagination. Events happening over the course of a decade have no feeling of time passing. Tyree barely discusses fashions of the 90's, hairstyles of the 90's, trends of the 90's TV shows, historical events, all these things a reader needs to see changing over the course of ten or fifteen years going by. Tyree drops the names of real musicians of the era, but our fictional hero and his singer never interact with them when they go on tour with them. Tyree writes about major cities like Detroit, Boston, Charlotte, Philadelphia and London, but uses no sentences to describe these exotic places to the reader. Just Say No! comes to a sloppy conclusion that disappoints and dissatisfies the reader. Darin's character doesn't grow from the experience and neither does John. The reader learns nothing about the music business and nothing about the pitfalls of stardom. Just Say No! Is a hollow story that provides a hollow reading experience. Just pass Just Say No! by on the bookstore shelf. If you want a good story about the pitfalls of stardom for black male musicians, go over to the DVD section and get Robert Townsend's The Five Heartbeats, Clint Eastwood's Bird, The Temptations mini-series or the PBS documentary on Coltrane. If you're looking for a good piece of Contemporary African-American fiction pick up What You Owe Me by Bebe Moore Campbell or Big Girls Don't Cry. 
 I purchased this cushion thinking it would be comfortable and durable. When you lay in the cushion it is rough and abrasive. If ANY water gets on it it stains immediately and the stain does not disappear when it drys. I am very dissatisfied with the cushion and would not purchase one agai 
 Having first seen the movie, I was prepared that this was not a starry-eyed wholesale endorsement of high school football, but I was still thrilled when my wife surprised me with a copy to read.  I have never been so dissapointed with a book on football, or all of sports for that matter. I enjoyed Next Man Up and A Civil War, due to Feinstein's balance between negative and positive lights on the game. Bissinger, in Friday Night Lights, shows no such balance. He does not "follow the season" in any logical fashion, sometimes skipping entire games, and spends a chapter instead focusing on national politics. Honestly, you'll see the name of Michael Dukakis more than you will the name of Permian's starting quarterback.  I love football, I love high school athletics, and found this book to be very annoying. Check it out in a library before you spend your dollars on it 
 This "novel" would be better suited for the stage.  It reads like a play, often.  It's not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting "high drama" within a family.  They suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all.  There are far too many scenes of shouting, histrionics.  The father goes from being Ward Cleaver to a verbally abusive monster.  If I had to see the mother one more time with her calling "Robin!" I was going to scream.  The author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict.  This author forces the climax onto us in every scene.  He's desperate for this end result of angst, high drama and shock.  It's overkill.  I don't believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous.  Sure it happens but this was the Leave it to Beaver family at first.  It just doesn't make sense that because of ONE incident, all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters.  In short, the author needs to be focused more on telling a story, allowing the reader to infer.  Instead, he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn.  It's ironic, actually, as he's trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that I just felt tedium.  Very, very contrived and forced novel.  Not believable.  I do not recommend 
 I don't get the positive reviews.  This author rehashes information that is in all of your basic finance books.  This would make a good magazine article, but it's a waste of 400 pages.  I'll save you $20 and give you the entire book here: 1. Mututal funds are usually ran in the interest of the company, not yours. 2. It's really hard to beat the market. 3. All of the fees and soft-dollaring reduce your investment returns greatly.  But you probably already knew this 
 This turn-of-the- (20th) century tranlation from the Arabic has been absolutely superceded by the Pines-Strauss University of Chicago edition. No one really interested in studying Maimonides can afford to use this translation.Maimonides in his introduction makes it clear just how careful he was in his choice of words, so someone who has to read the book in translation cannot afford to save a few bucks and buy  a flawed versio 
 If MTV was smart, and they used to be, along with funny, relevant, and entertaining (they even played music videos all the time!) It was on all day in my house, and you could always count on the VJs passing along some wacky facts, or artists dropping by who could actually speak coherently. Anyway, MTV could make their massive video catalog available to the public. You could browse online and choose the videos you wanted, pay $2-$3 each and MTV would either create a custom DVD for you and send it out, or you could download them and make your own DVDs. I would gladly pay to have several DVDs that contained only the videos I wanted. And there are about 100 I want, just off the top of my head.   As it is, I am happy to watch my old and fading copies made back then and occasionally catch an old great on VH1 Classic, rather than have someone else pick out 10 videos, 4 of which I may want, the rest I don't. This one did nothing for me. Luckily it was a gift. I never would've bought it for myself 
 The Good: The book contains an abundance of illustrations which can be very helpful.  The author uses the text of the book itself as bad examples of design.  The Bad: As a newbie to publication design, I approached this book as a student.  I probably would have never even opened the cover of it if it weren't required for a class.  The design of the cover (and most of the book) is horrible.  I can't read the title and it does nothing to attract me visually.  The illustrations are so sloppy they are unprofessional.  Although sketches in real life should be messy, the sketches in the book should at least be interpretable.  The author never uses any concrete terminology, so it is difficult categorize information as you absorb it. 
 As a fan of historical mysteries, I was looking forward to starting this popular series.  I was deeply disappointed.  First of all, the character of Amelia Peabody is not appealing, and through her the author reveals that she has only a very superficial understanding of Victorian values and thinking.  (Although if you don't mind an author sticking a character with modern sensibilities in period dress, maybe this is for you.)  Furthermore, the mystery was simply not that interesting.  I found myself reading only to finish the book, for I had little interest in finding out who committed the murders. The success of this series and the acclaim the author has received truly baffle me 
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 This book is the worst of postmodern popular criticism--well, not the worst. The author is fairly comprehensible, unlike many of his colleagues. However, he is so full of his own cleverness and so enmeshed in a really  tired critical pomo framework that this book becomes incredibly annoying to  read. What a lost opportunity. This could have been a useful analysis of a  cultural phenomenon--buy it for the nice design and photos if you must have  every dinosaur book in print, but don't bother reading it 
 This measuring cup is very difficult to slide and to clean.  It is much easier to spray a regular measuring cup with non-stick cooking spray to help release sticky things such as peanut butter or honey.  Spend your money on a good set of traditional measuring cups 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 This book is doctrinally-slanted in favor of Arminianism.    One example: The author's entry for Acts 13:48 goes out of it's way to specifically warn you against the "Calvinist" interpretation of this verse.  The book suggests that Acts 13:48 should be properly translated: "As many as *set themselves* unto eternal life were saved".  There is nothing in the Greek that would call for such an interpretation, and none of the mainstream bible translations have such a wording.  The author implies that all mainstream bible translations (NASB,KJV,NIV,NKJV,ESV,etc.) of this verse are wrong, and that he is right.    Another example of the author's eisegesis is in his translation of Ephesians 1:4 for the words "Chosen in Him".  For this verse he quotes Cremer as saying "This verse cannot be taken to imply a division of mankind into two classes according to a divine plan before history began".     I would highly suggest looking into alternative resources which do not exhibit a traditional bias, and where the author is committed to truth in translating.  This author is not trustworthy 
 I should have read the back cover more closely before buying Mirabai Starr's translation of the Interior Castle.  To her credit, she admits to her butchery of the text.  As cited by other reviewers, she provides a list of the words that she changed; Lord to Beloved, devil to "spirit of evil," sin with "missing the mark," etc.  However, all her semantics serve to do is to force the reverse translation by the reader, and it grew quickly tiresome to mentally exchange "Lord" for every instance of "Beloved."  Not to mention the sneaking suspicion that Ms. Starr had monkeyed with the text to a greater extent than she admits.  But, again, you have to admire Ms Starr's honesty in her statement that "[Teresa] would have approved of my boldness, if not the results."  This amounts to an admission by Ms Starr that her modifications substantially change the meaning of Teresa's text.  Despite all the linguistic hijinks, Starr's translation of the Interior Castle is not "Free of Dogma" as is its claim.  The concept of the soul is dogma.  The redemptive suffering of Christ is dogma.  Teresa's  patterns of prayer and life are rooted in dogma.  To attempt to pen a "dogma-free Interior Castle" is like attempting to write a "math-free Calculus".  What the attempt to "free Teresa from the cage of Christianity" reveals is a complete denial of Teresa's life and devotion.  Whatever pressures Teresa may have felt at the hands of the inquisitors and the Church heirarchy, Teresa was voluntarily a Carmelite and she deeply believed in all sorts of inconvenient things.  Teresa cannot be separated from Christianity - nor can she be separated from Catholicism.  In the end, far from being dogma-free and modernized, Starr's interpretation of Teresa's Interior Castle is simply castrated, lobotomized, sterile, and confused 
 not being hip, I must venture out and say:    Oh my God!!!  What????  Who cares?  Franny is pregnant.  The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s.  But beyond that, what's the point?  Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood.  Boring in the 50s and boring now.  As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey.  Holden was familiar.  Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.  I really wish I had the time back that I spent reading this trite piece of...         
 I've read several of Greg Benford's novels, and although this novel tackles some interesting ideas, on the whole it is sketchy, underdeveloped and lacks continuity. This might have been more entertaining if the authors had stuck with one segment and worked through it. The action is nonexsistent, extended over nearly one hundred years and broken up into 20-25 page chapters for each time period. The characters are few, two-dimensional, and unsympathetic. Plotlines are too many and undeveloped, (none of the aliens stick around for more than a few pages, nothing is taken to any kind of a logical conclusion.) Finally, there is a very unsatisfying ending. You might want to try reading "Heart of the comet," which Benford co-wrote with David Brin 
 After seeing some of the other Amazon reviews of this movie, and the fact that Jason Swartzman was in it (after having seen him for the first time in "Rushmore" - a wonderful film), I had to purchase a copy of this DVD for myself to view.  It's got a wonderful cast of fine actors, but I found this movie really dumb.  One critic on the DVD box claimed this was "Laugh Out Loud Funny."  Really?  What movie was he watching?  I strained a chuckle here and there, but that was about it for me.  The Lily Tomlin & Dustin Hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script.  I know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie, but I didn't find much to snicker about.  
 We need the Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings Trilogy fame, to do this book justice.  The Book MISTS OF AVALON was WONDERFUL - this film was chopped up and missing so much that it wasn't really worth watching, in my humble opinion.  A waste of wonderful actors, terrible job on screen play.  GET PETER JACKSON and his production company busy on this 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 Maybe I am not smart enough for this book, it certainly isn't for the novice!!  I ended up more confused than educated 
 As far as I am concerned, '8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly' was a total waste of my money.  I've been following this workout and eating plan for over four months now and have seen no reduction in neither my belly size nor my weight.  Frankly, I was seeing more results from my old Denise Austin Low Impact Aerobic Workout tape than this, so it looks like I'm saying goodbye to Jorge and going back to Denise.  Sorry Jorge, I gave it my best shot but your plan just doesn't work for me 
 Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book. 
 The John Carter of Mars series of books, by my favorite author of all time,   Edgar Rice Burroughs,  is his best series. I was so excited to receive the audio version of this book, but when I listened to it, I was hoorified !    John Carter sounded like a wimp.  A girly Southerner, not at all the swashbuckling hero I envisioned.   Now, maybe I'm spoiled by the narrators of other books, but even the weakest, most boring readings have not turned me off in the way that John Bolen has.   Please Tantor audio,  get some one else to read this, and make sure it is a Manly-Man ! 
 Mr. Hawk's style in this "short" annoys me. He uses incomplete, choppy and disjointed sentences. This might not bother me in a lecture setting, but in print, it's distracting. It reads as if someone transcribed a short pep-talk, including the spoken "Thank you" at the end. The information given is sloppily offered. The author (or speaker) switches between first, second, and third person much too casually. I would give the piece zero stars instead of one, except that it's true one should tell an interviewer that one can think and focus. But it's not worth the cost of paper and ink to print it, and the little bit I paid to find that out was also wasted. 
 I can't believe how many great reviews this horrible film got. The acting is laughable as is the writing. There are also many mistakes and inaccuracies! They depict the heroes as perfection and the enemy as monkeys.  Real life isn't like that.  I guess just because this movie is pro-war people automatically back it up.  But this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist, is he begins with a typical theory: America is bad and all that it does is bad, finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together, and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme. Despite Chomsky's belief that Bin Laden's attacks were driven by US foreign policy, all one has to do is go to the source, whom Chomsky believes can be taken at his word, to realize the goals of Bin Laden.   All actions taken by Bin Laden and his organization have this specific and narrow goal: to re-create the Islamic Caliphate that existed centuries ago and basing it on Shari'a. It is driven by a chauvinistic belief that "Dar es Harb" does not deserve its prosperity and "Dar es Salam" deserves to take its rightful place of power on the world stage. Realistically, the only thing standing in the way of the recreation of the Caliphate is the United States and the force it can project to prevent this, and that's why Bin Laden believes it needs to be destroyed. One does not even have to stoop to Chomsky's level of vile intellectual dishonesty to make this point, Bin Laden's own words are very clear on this.   "the pious Caliphate will start from Afghanistan"  This is Bin Laden's reason for 9/11, everything else from the Palestinian issue to Iraq, to Saudi Arabia is a pile on to garner him mainstream support, but his core ideology a, Shari'a governed Islamic Caliphate, is what motivates his backers, allies. and foot soldiers.   Chomsky confidence that he understands everything that motivated Bin Laden, is more a projection of his own beliefs, ideology and motivations for wanting to see America destroyed than Bin Laden's motivations. Chomsky on September 11th is like someone who, upon hearing that Reagan was shot, immediately launches into a ten-minute tirade  about the Contras, Cuba, Palestine, Vietnam (etcetera), only to be told that was all about Jodie Foster.  His analysis, if that's what one could call this tripe, about Bin Laden also repeats the often told lie that Bin Laden was involved with the US during the 80's in Afghanistan. The Mujahideen were split into 6 different factions , three of which were hardliner Islamists : Islamic Party , Islamic society , Islamic Unity and three moderate factions : Islamic Revolutionary Movement , National Islamic Front , and National Liberation Front . None of these factions were led by Bin Laden and not all them were supplied by America, the hardliners were supplied by Pakistan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Don't believe it, look up Rober Fisk's interview with Bin Laden in 1988 where Bin Laden categorically denies that he took any assistance from the US during the Afghan Jihad.   If you want to know who Bin Laden is read Michael Scheuer, if you want to know what drives him, read Daniel Pipes, and if you want a poor alternative for toilet paper read Chomsky.  
 Being the mother of an autistic daughter, I have read a few books on the subject. This book was much too clinical to the parent who basically wants to know what is happening to their child.  I have read other books which talk on this subject in language which is easier to understand 
 This book does not cover the new exams that have been revised as of September, 2002. Don't bother, wait for the next release 
 I was very disappointed in the content. There were not enough color plates and transparency in the color was lacking. Many of the instructions were used with black and white sketches and plates. Many of Kautskys subjects and scenes appeared to me to be "pre watercolor career" pencil sketches which I recognized.  Dark somber and sparse in my opinion 
 The text is wordy and often redundant.  Some issues are discussed with far too much detail and reiteration while others are statements without meaningful diatribe.    I did enjoy the historical presentations but the spiritual presentations were difficult to cull through and not very enlightening 
 I found this book to be a good source of information concerning Lorac's nightmare and nothing more. This book titled 'Dalamar the dark' centered more on the events transpiring around him than it did on Dalamar himself. As a long time Dalamar fan I found it very disappointing, it left me knowing little more about the mysterious elf than I had known before. A lot of things about this book disappoint me, but all that really needs to be said is..Dalamar deserves far better. Am I the only one that thinks that picture of Dalamar looks more human than elven, besides the ears of course ; 
 My office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract.  No person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance.  Battery life is terrible out of the box, the interface is clunky, and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance.  If everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you-- it will give you SOMETHING to complain about.  For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your Nextel/Sprint network contract 
 I couldnt understand anything that was going on. In the first "act", i suppose, it seems a weird green man loses balls, and his friends go to find them. Right. How retarded is that? I cant imagine a worse product, possibly that annoying Pantera cd i bought. What a lousy "film", its even a cartoon 
 The book was great, but this version of the audiobook leaves so much out.  I prefer the unabridged versions 
 The "Everything Grant Book" is not very helpful to those who are serious about trying to locate and obtain grant funding.  The book provides a very broad-brush approach to grant writing with limited examples.  The first seven chapters go back-and-forth between government and foundation grants, which is very confusing, especially for the beginning grant writer.  Even though government and foundation grants have some common elements, they require very different approaches.  When the reader finally reaches Chapter 8 "Components of a Grant Proposal," it really discusses solicitations, with only one page dedicated to grant components.  Chapter 9 provides very basic information about preparing to writer a grant.  Chapter 10 talks about "letters of support," which seems out-of-place considering the authors have yet to discuss the major elements of a grant proposal.  Chapters 11-15 discuss the real conponents of most government grants, but once again fail to provide a comprehensive presentation with realistic examples.  Chapter 16 "Other Grant Proposal Sections" includes information (staff qualifications, management plan, etc.) that really belongs in Chapter 13 "Action Plans."  Chapter 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 include very basic information about writing, reviewing, and filling out forms, and submitting proposals.  The book ends with "Writing Grants as a Career," which seems like an awkward ending.  If I had to rely on this book to give me the background to be a grant writer, I would be struggling to make a living.  I suggest potential grant writers look for a book that has only one emphasis (government or foundation), is better organized, and provides more contemporary examples.  
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 this book it's all over the place, it lacks structure, how are you suppose to follow the process of self hypnosis if there is no structure, this book should be re-edited 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 I got that title after to have read the generally very good reviews. I was however quite disappointed by this movie, its average plot, average acting (especially "Mark") and rather clich ending 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 I have read many books on WWII from many perspectives and have been to visit the D-Day beaches four times. I cannot visit the American graves in Normandy without being moved. Twice I have had the experience of hearing taps played near Omaha Beach. I have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died. I had high expectations for the book. My problem is that the book never finds its voice. At times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men. I wanted to hear more from this man. Just as he starts to share, the general leaps in and throws off the narrative. Let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different. (A few photos and maps would be nice). If the general needs to talk, give him a separate chapter at the end of the book. We hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels. Their voices could add to the history. I wish the colonel would have spoken for them 
 This program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details. I'm only using it for a simple garage and I expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions. Not so. You might as well pick up a copy of The Sims so you could at least have some fun with it. If you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it, forget it. Very disappointing waste of money 
 I just returned from amsterdam and I brought some internet materials that I printed out (different articles) and two guide books, I never looked at this one while I was there.  I dont think it has a lot of really useful information, there just arent a lot of details provided - it feels like it tries to cover too much.   My advice would be to decide on what you are interested in doing there: walking, museums, biking... and find for a book that is more directly related to what you are looking for. I feel I wasted my money on this book 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 A failed attempt to turn a life-philosophy into a novel.   De Sade could have used an editor (I guess no one wanted to share a cell with him), the book is extremely repetitive.  The characters are not people, just mouth pieces for De Sade and his detractors.  As a work of literature it is as big a failure as Ayn Rand's literary efforts to advocate her libertine philosophy in the economic sphere-- but of course literature wasn't his aim.   So then it must be shocking? not anymore.  Why read it? cultural literacy I guess.  
 As amazing as it would have been to finally watch the famed MURDER SHE WROTE/MAGNUM P.I. crossover as it originally aired -- and, as the packaging would lead you to believe, should also appear in this box set -- they included the WRONG VERSION of the "Magnum" episode. When it was originally created, they shot the episode with two endings: The "to be continued" ending for the crossover, and then a self-contained ending for syndication purposes. The DVD packagers grabbed the wrong version! AAAARGH! This is an awfully expensive package for such a sloppy mistake 
 the female vocalist jennifer sanon is god-awful. her performance on vocals has completely ruined what looked like a promising album. a friend stated that this singer sounds very much like abbey lincoln. well, now i know why i don't own any abbey lincoln music. boooooooooooooooooo! wynton. you made the wrong choice on vocals 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 This book does not appear to be good for beginners or professionals.  It does have details on constructing ponds, but it is seriously lacking in the `care and feeding' of koi.  This area is covered conversationally and although the important topics are mentioned, it does not provide details.  So it is not a practical beginner's guild.  Nor does it provide technical details such as chemistry or anatomy that you might expect in a professional's guide.  I liked the photography.  However, if you are looking for a book on pond building or koi photos, there are better books than this one on either subject.  
 I purchased this for my 3 year old son and no sooner than we had taken him out of the box and ran it on the table the treads came off.  I am constantly looking for the treads, or fixing them.  All the other Thomas toys we have are great, but Terrance doesn't seem as durable as the others, thus making this toy in my opinion a flop 
 These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom.  The fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff.  I lost three bags of milk due to leaks.  If you have to transport the bags anywhere, like back and forth to work like I do, I would avoid these bags.  They just leaked all over the place for me, even after I carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions.  I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these.  
 There is no built in HDTV tuner. Sent it back and got the TC-26LX60 and love it 
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 Bernard Lewis is a historian of the Ottoman era.  Period.  He sets himself up as an expert on Arabs and the modern Middle East, which is preposterous.  He does not know Arabic and certainly does not routinely converse with modern Arabs, in all of their many countries.  He uses terms like Unbelievers, which insults Westerners, when Muslims never do and never would -- that term is used by extremists whose mentality is much like that of our White Aryans.  And just about as representative.  In everything he writes, Lewis harps on the House of War and House of Peace, an idea one thousand years out of date.  That was Crusader-era thinking, which was outrageous and should embarrass both sides today. The problem is not religion, it is political policies, and long digressions into Crusader and post-Crusader history do not shed insight into beliefs and resentments today.  He uses broad terms like "Muslim rage" -- all Muslims?  Certainly not.  Consider his assertion that it is an intolerable humiliation for Muslims to be taught by Unbelievers -- does that make sense?  With the thousands of Muslims who are being, and have been, educated in the West?  Who hire Western advisors? "What went wrong?"  Western intrusion into the Middle East region, that's what.  Today most vividly illustrated by Israel and Iraq, and shoring up corrupt regimes like the Saudis (who are no friends of America and promote their exclusivist religion to our detriment).  But to admit political issues is to bring up the too-painful possibility of reviewing America's policies, so Lewis et al. harp on religion (are 5 million Muslims in America motivated to hurt anybody? They are in every city and town.  Do they hate America and or non-Muslims?  Try asking them, because Lewis certainly has not).   Lewis has done immeasurable damage to the image of Muslims and Middle Easterners, and fostered much hatred based on his reckless statements.  This is the EXPERT who advised the Bush White House and encouraged the neocon insanity to go about happily creating democracies in the Middle East which would then lead to love all around...  easy success in Iraq would be just the beginning of this miracle.  On this rests his credibility 
 I mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would PROTECT my computer from BEING KILLED, but instead, this thing has KILLED my computer FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 4 DAYS, EMITTING AN UN-STOPPABLE(i.e., CAN'T TURN THE FEATURE OFF) SHRIEK ALARM. How do smart, talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear-piercing shriek-alarm that can't be defeated / silenced?  In addition to doing far, far more damage than it can ever prevent, ask yourself -- do you want this un-stoppable ear-piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at 2a.m.? I BOUGHT ONE APC PRODUCT, AND SO FAR, THEY'RE 100% DEFECTIVE AND 100% DELITERIOUS TO THE USE OF MY COMPUTER & IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DELITERIOUS TO MY SLEEP. 
 The secret is this:  Martians are plotting to take over the late, great planet Earth.  And the way to do it is by releasing inane books like 'The Secret' and then release it also on DVD for those people who don't know how to read.  And while these people are dreaming of those Gucci handbags on the other side of the window in their dreams late at night, the Martians will sneek up on them and tickle their toes and scare them half to death.  Or all the way.    And then they will take over the planet.  While we all sleep.  (We don't have to fear Communists anymore.)  Just those Martians.  Winston Churchill once said, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."  That's not true.  We have to fear those Martians 
 This book reads like a horror novel.  By allowing her dogs (as well as another one in her care) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads, the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals' welfare.  Not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors, and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps.  Oh, and let's not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author's choice not to spay and neuter her animals.  This book moves at a peppy pace, and might have been interesting (albeit morally reprehensible) if the author's "observations" actually provided any insight.  But those eighteen-wheelers on the Alewife Parkway veered closer to poor Misha than the author's whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence.  Case in point:  She is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one's litter of puppies.  Oops!  Any genuine dog lover (or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense) will despise this book.  A previous reviewer hit the nail on the head: If "feelings" are your road map to life, you might enjoy this book.  If you regularly take your brain out for walk, forget it.  Calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" the definitive text on marine fowl 
 there is not enough information about my assignment  
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 Bad pictures. Not enough about his death. Nat Hentoff continues to prove that he can't write. Boring. Greatly exaggerates Bix's influence on the world of jazz. Don't pay for this, pull an Abbie Hoffman 
 In less than 3 months the seals didn't work because the velcrow came apart.  Everything inside gets wet.  Poor product 
 Most of Koontz's books carry you right along to the end and are enjoyable, but some derail and go in directions that are not as interesting as others.  I found this book to be that way and despite the 4 star review, was rather bored with it once it got away from Ironheart's rescues.  I'd recommend skipping this one 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 Attrative, compact, easy to use.   Poor reception on some FM stations.  My digital MP3 player, which fits into the change pocket of my slacks provides much better reception over entire AM/FM range 
 In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.    For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment.  Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images.  These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around 
 After proclaiming in an earlier book that we are now living in a 'borderless world', Ohmae now writes about the 'end of the nation state'.  Ohmae's work is very popular among geographers who like to use it as an antidote to their own research and perspectives. They claim that national borders still matter and, in general, that space has become more rather than less important. Ohmae has allegedly not understood this. So, I expected Ohmae to argue that the nation state didn't matter any more. But he did not do this. On the contrary, all his examples show that the nation state is still very important. Rather than proving that the nation state does not matter any more, Ohmae shows that people like him can be very frustrated by the actions of nation states. He basically argues that the nation state hinders the market and therefore should be dissolved. He tells us that we should give managers of multinationals all the space and freedom they need so we can benefit from the blessings of the market. Ohmae equates market forces with freedom and prosperity and associates the nation state with repression and corruption. Rather than an economic analysis, his book is a political agenda for right-wing politicians and the managers of TNC's. I think that most people who question the benevolence of the market, will be very irritated by the way Ohmae confuses his own personal interest and the interests of the economic/managerial elite in general with the public interest. I'm one of those people and I can't say that I gained a lot of knowledge from reading this work. Nevertheless, I have to say that Ohmae presents his arguments in a very challenging way. That makes the book interesting in at least one respect, and I guess that people who share his political view will therefore enjoy the book. I didn't enjoy it and I hope that other people will also read between the lines and see that business gurus like Ohmae represent the interests of a small minority (mainly share holders of TNC's) rather than the general interest 
 I don't know what is happening with authors these days, but with each book they seem to get worse and Catherine Coulter is following trend. Ms. Coulter's early works such as "The Legacy Trilogy", "The Magic Trilogy" were really good, but "Pengragon"  was very bad. I didn't realy care about the either of the main characters and the only reason that read the book was the fact that I spent over eight dollars for it. Maybe Ms. Coulter and others should take a break and take the time to write a book that is worth its money 
 While Malamud is without doubt a very skilled writer, I gave up attempting to read this book approximately 1/3 of the way through it.  The atmosphere of the book was overwhelmingly dour and depressing: story after story of loneliness, poverty, bleakness, bitterness, struggle, alienation from family.  It leaves one ready to jump off a bridge somewhere 
 We were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday.  After opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied.  However the screen is very disappointing.  I can't even rate the games because overall I simply just can't see what is on it.  The product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing.  I should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products.  I would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it 
 This movie had some good potental in the opening, after that, it looses all grip on everything, the plot of the movie is based on a new JSF style creation fighter FA-37, and a new VTO&L controlled artificially by a "AI", one thing leads to another the "AI" goes haywire during a lighting storm, it starts acting on it's own to destroy "threats" one thing leads to another their in Tajikistan setting off dirty nuclear weapons, north korea, russia for absoulutly no reason breaking numerus international laws, at one point in the movie, the star of the movie "falon 1" helps destroy intercepting fighters with the "AI" whois hes ment to track down breaking a bunch of laws himself, and is treated like a hero at the end.  It's a backwards movie, don't watch it, please don't 
 Before taking a 4 hour train trip, I surveyed the pulp novels available at the news-stand.  I didn't want to make the mistake of picking up another book I would have to throw away in disgust 3 days later, like "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" or anything by that man-hating forensic anthropologist, what's-her-name.  So I went with "Bourne Ultimatum" as a safe bet, figuring, since I had seen "Identity" and "Supremacy" in the movie incarnations, and they were pretty good, this would be more of the same.    I was very wrong.  From the first few chapters, it became clear that the book was incoherent, repetitive, and its characters were laughably underdeveloped.  Later, huge holes in the plot began to appear, apparent lapses in reason and knowledge on the part of the author regarding their own material.  These seem to haunt many pulp novels, but nowhere is it more annoying.  Also, the author has the lazy habit of putting a lot of dialogue in italics to show emotion, rather than writing emotional dialogue.    This book has become almost unreadable, so it's going to the curb tomorrow.  I'm quitting on page 263.  I don't like or feel attached to any of the characters, and the plot has become a confusing spiral of contrivances.  I agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this book is a real slog to read; the opposite of a page-turner.  It's sad to see a trilogy that apparently started well, end like this.  You can guess from reading it that Ludlum, if he even wrote it, had no interest in the material, but had a contract to fulfill.              
 I read this book as part of a Contemporary World Literature course I took in college, and I thought it was the worst book I have ever read.  The book is supposed to be about a white woman in South Africa whose father is in prison because of his anti-apartheid views.  The strange thing is I learned NOTHING about South Africa, living conditions for whites and blacks in South Africa, and the effect that apartheid had on people in living in South Africa.  This book was written in a hoity-toity, avant garde, stream of conciousness fashion that it was impossible to know what was going on.  I found myself counting the number of pages until I finished the book.  The author of this book should seriously consider writing a book that is coherent, informs people, and broadens their horizon of knowledge, which this book certainly does NOT do 
 DO NOT ORDER THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON.COM. I ordered it 6 weeks ago from them, and it has yet to ship. Even though it still says IN STOCK and SHIPS WITHIN 24 HOURS, this book has not been shipped to me yet. I recommend looking at www.bn.com, where they ship very quickly 
 i love music and i love making music, but i don't read music or study it.  to me, that would take all the fun out of it.  if you're like me, you might dislike this book.  this book is HUGE... excluding the appendices, it's about 440 large pages of instructions.. are you kidding me?  it says things like "do this one particular thing for 5 minutes, then this for 7 minutes" etc..  i would never try to follow so many detailed, lengthy instructions..  i like other OOBE books i've seen better.  maybe this is great for some people, but i need something easier, and more to the point.  
 Purchased this product to improve my cable signal quality. When I hooked it up the signal quality was worse than using an antenna. You will be wasting your money buying this product 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I delayed writing this review because I don't like trashing anyone's work.  But this book is so infuriatingly bad that I finally felt compelled to blow off steam.  O'Hara deserves better.  The reader certainly deserves far better.  And Knopf, a one-great publisher in sad decline, should have either done extensive editing on this horribly self-indulgent mess or simply not published it.  As an O'Hara fan (who recognizes his flaws as a writer and, certainly, as a man) and a born-in-"Gibbsville" insider, I assure readers that the author did not do the most basic research on O'Hara's home town.  On the contrary, Wolff appears to have fabricated a number of quotes he claims to have collected in Pottsville/Gibbsville.  But the voices don't sound like the voices I know, in tone or content, and the quotes suspiciously support the author's utterly inaccurate thesis that O'Hara's never been accepted "back home."  Well, in downtown Pottsville, there's a handsome statue of O'Hara.  Every year, there's a "John O'Hara Weekend," with performances, readings and seminars.  O'Hara still appears so often in local newspapers and magazines that you'd think he was still living and writing.  I grew up reading his work--and never heard any of the silly, parochial--and, of course, anonymous--criticism Wolff claims to have encountered immediately upon arrival during his apparently brief visit to Pottsville, the inspiration for so much of O'Hara's greatest fiction.  And Wolff even gets basic facts wrong, from ethnic composition to the location of hotel bars.  Later in the book, as well, he continues to indulge his habit of quoting anonymous sources who perfectly support his eccentric, self-adoring themes.  And the prose itself is a mix of trash bio that makes Kitty Kelly read like Boswell and gonzo-tone scream-of-my-precious-consciousness slop that should have been submitted to the author's psychiatrist, not to a publisher.  Poor O'Hara--his own worst enemy during his life, now afflicted with biographers who are his worst enemies after death.  O'Hara was a great, if flawed, author, currently underestimated.  Indeed, he merits a serious critical biography that does more than simply repeat the traditional wisdom that his late, sprawling novels had little merit; on the contrary, despite their flaws, novels such as A Rage To Live and From The Terrace offer incomparable social portraits of America during the first half of the 20th century--and his first novel, Appointment In Samarra, is flawless, a middle-class (though not middle-brow) Gatsby.  I recommend reading his own work, rather than this appallingly bad pretense at biography.  Finally, I apologize to all, even to the author, for writing such a negative review...I would rather praise a book.  But this biography is so disgracefully bad that I felt obliged to warn other readers off.  Any of the earlier O'Hara bios would be a much better choice for those interested in O'Hara's troubled, troubling but remarkably productive life 
 I had to use this book in an undergraduate course. It is extremely biased and the author on many instances goes way over the line into editorializing. It is a poor example of true history but an excellent example of revisionist history. In chapter 9 the author states " But in history we care as much about what people believe to have happened as we do about the literal truth". Any time a historian puts as much emphasis on tales as much as fact they are on thin academic ice.  
 I see all the people here like this book, but I don't get why.  The first half is unpleasant though intriguing.  Styron seems to think it is interesting for characters to rant eccentrically about whatever is on their mind, but I would disagree, and I soon started skipping all rants.  The story is intriguing, and for a while the book was kind of interesting, as we see the naive narrator come to see the truth of his pretentious friend.  Half way through, the book becomes fairly unreadable as it changes focus to a different character.  This begins with an entire chapter of the sort of rant that I found so unpleasant, and then proceeds through a tedious accounting of an unpleasant and dull tortured artist type.  I tried reading this for a while but it was so annoying that I just skimmed the second half to see how everything was tied up, which it was in a perfunctory fashion.  I suppose this is good for Styron fans.  I've never read any of his books before and certainly never will again 
 I was surprized to find that The Yeast Connection left me feeling disappointed.The lay out of the material is less than "handy" and the overall flow of the information that could be helpful to someone setting up a cleansing program is irratically placed through out the book. I also purchased the Yeast Connection Cookbook and was horrified to find the author supplying alternative meat sources such as hippopotamus,lion and giraffe. What's up with that? Have they lost their minds 
 I really don't like boston that much. they are kind of overrated and lousy. One of the worst songs I have ever heard is More than  a feeling and i don't get it why people like it. The only 2 good songs are Foreplay, and Smokin. The rest of this is junk. I love the cover anyway. 
 Poor product.  No strap comes with this case.  Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped.  Front view cover is smeary and scratched.  Buttons are difficult to re-snap.  No need for other voting on this --just a poor product 
 its just a review not enough to explain usmle type question 
 Nicky Cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment, as he turns  in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi 
 This book is not what it appears. It is a defense of Woodwards assesment of Nixon and watergate and attempts to imply that this is what brought down Clinton. THAT IS NOT THE CASE as Clinton was not only a lier but clearly immoral. There is no way Mr. Woodward can cover his Political leaning with this type of story. When you read this book it clearly is 50% Clinton and defending his and Hilary's actions under Whitewater and the Clintons' misconduct in the Whitehouse as President. In all fairness to Mr. Woodward this book is far below his standard of fair and honest reporting. Let admit it, this is no more than a defense of his reporting on Clinton and Nixon 
 There is a lot of traffic in Rome.  Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents  are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains.  Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't.  There are many American tourists in Rome,  especially around the fountains in the piazzas,  where they cluster and sing American songs.  Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances.    "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma".  Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night.   But Rome is not what it used to be.  Everybody knew each other and was polite,  while now everybody is rushed and rude.  Besides, the free love of today has substituted  the brothels of yesterday.  Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so.   Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact,  bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical  performance. The public then proceeded to the  shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue.   The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court.  They run parties together, even fashion shows.  Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope  how to rule the Church.   And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the  Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence.   One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time.   Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say  about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the  standard collection of stereotypes  about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every  scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide?    It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially  the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes.    And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.    That is perhaps also a scene worth watching.   But the rest is commercial cinema.   "Vai a dormi', Federico".    
 I was looking forward to receiving this body lotion; however was very disappointed when I opened it and smelled the fragrance.  It smells exactly like paint.  Then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint-like scent.  I will not buy any more Philosophy products.  The less expensive fragrances/lotions are so much better that you buy from Target, Wal-Mart, etc 
 Save your money and time, even you like some of the actors, the movie is a pure flunk!! 
 Hands down this is Bukowski's single worst book.  Bought it when it first came out just before/after his death in 1994.  Having read just about everything the man had written, "Pulp" was a hugely disappointing epitaph.  If you've never read Bukowski start with "Post Office" or the short story collections, but avoid this like the plague.  A bad book.  I can't think of a single reason to recommend it 
 The book seems to miss the mark. It just seems like he thought he could slap star wars and christianity on it to make a quick buck. Hey these 2 things have made tons of money in the past right? Ok not a good idea to put the 2 things together. Get dharma of star wars and leave this book on the dark side 
 Lawrence Otis Graham has a tremendously rich vein of material here in his study of the preferred social and educational venues of the African-American upper crust, from their history with traditionally black colleges (Howard, Morehouse, Spelman and Fisk), social clubs (the Links, Boulé, AKA), and even their children's groups (Jack and Jill). Graham relates many fascinating anecdotes about this social set that are often extremely telling both their pride in their achievements and the cruel snobbery they inflict upon one another and others excluded from their set: his story about asking his brother and his bride to "jump the broom" (an old wedding tradition dating back to slave days), and the horrified fury it inspires in the DC social set, is particularly remarkable. But Graham seems almost entirely unwilling to do any actual analysis of his rich sociological material, or follow up on the many questions it seems to provoke about why such communities have been formed, what and whom they exclude, and what has been the effect of such studied exclusion among Americans of all classes and races. Unwilling to be a Thorstein Veblen for this social set, he instead becomes its Ward McAllister, making list after list of names of prominent African-Americans both living and deceased who belong to this set. (There is, of course, a helpful and extensive index, so anyone who might wish to see their inclusion in these lists might easily find the correct page.) The richness of the material makes you mostly sad for what an opportunity Graham has thrown away by refusing to analyze the causes and effects of the set from which he comes 
 I read three versions of the Arthurian legends recently, and this one was the weakest.  The language is somewhere between Malory's archaic form and modern prose, but does not succeed well at being either.  The tales were also, in my opinion, less well told than in the others.  For your consideration, I read La Morte D'Arthur in an abridged version and Roger Lancelyn Green's "King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table" from the Puffin Classics series.  I enjoyed Green's telling the best, as it was credibly compiled from a number of works (including Malory) and had some excellent atmospheric illustrations.  Though it is a Puffin Classics edition, I did not find the usual condescension or "dumbing down" that often occurs in youth literature.    Get Green's version.  It was just as cheap right here on Amazon, and well worth every penny 
 After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my "M" tape was providing. I opted for this "TZ" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to "narrow". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the "narrow" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another "great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so. I really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars! You have been warned 
 And if you aren't already a fan, I can't imagine you'd be interested in this quick gloss over of Harrison's life.  Honestly, I was given this book as a present.  And I read it over two days when I was home sick.  The book is an easy read, and isn't poorly written.  It doesn't sensationalize or gossip either. Thus the second star on the rating.  But there was almost nothing in this book that I didn't already know.  It was same as watching the show "Biography".     If you need this book for your Harrison collection, then look for it in the bargain bin.  Otherwise, I'd stay away. 
 I love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  After seeing this set at Sephora I tried it for a week and found the results mediocre.   My hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but I am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  The shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  The mouse is interesting.  It definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  The overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.    As is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  I believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair.  I would recommend you try it.  You can always return it if you're not satisfied 
 Let me preface this by saying I picked up a "Dark" series book a few years ago, as I'd heard of the author, and I do love the paranormal genre.  It was garbage.  I accidently picked up "Oceans of Fire" recently, realized who wrote it, but read it anyway, and found it above par. So, desperate for a read, skimming the stacks at the bookstore, I picked up Dark Magic.  Big mistake.  Again-garbage.  The female lead creeps me out-The classic romance 'feisty but with nothing to back it up "Don't tell me what to do, you are not the boss of me," type- then two minutes later is meek passive chick. Bah.  "I want to live my own life, leave me alone.....oh, dear you are so strong and manly, I cannot resist you!"   I am not quoting the book...just giving a feel of the dialogue.  Why do author's think a female lead that can manage to say no once or twice, or has an occasional clever retort, but actually has no backbone, is appealing?  This type of behavior went on and on and on......until, of course, the conditioning sets in, and the female lead gives up.  The male lead is the classic semi abusive control freak slash father figure who basically rapes the female lead, tells her what to do because it is for her own good, and she of course, falls right in line.  Why in hades do women readers like these type of male leads?  I absolutely loathe both of these kind of male and female characters.  The bad guys were kinda of lame, and so was the big battle against the baddy.  Save your money.  Since the Anita Blake series hit the skids about three books past, I'm starving for a good vampy paranormal. After reading this, I'm kinda barfy.      
 From Chapter 7, I present this excerpt:  "There is nothing like a book," social thinker Michael Novak rightly notes. "Held in hand. Underlined. Kept on a shelf nearby. Remembered for years. People expect to be moved by books, to learn, to be changed."  South Park Conservatives did no such thing.  What I thought would be a book about an interesting topic and demographic, was nothing more than a shallow explanation that, indeed, many people in this country choose to enjoy conservative media outlets.  From picking off some poll results, using a lot of quotes, and a lot of anecdotal evidence, this book is very much lacking in substance.  If you disagree or agree with the premise of the book from the outset, you will be unswayed.  If you are a critical thinker, you'll simply be underwhelmed.  
 Given the rave reviews for this book, I was surprised by the lack of content and value. The book's message is a truism: only you are responsible for your own happiness. It goes on to encourage you to ask for what you want. These aren't bad assertions but they're more complicated to implement than this book would have you believe. The content is structured like an article in a woman's magazine: it uses a bulletized format with basic questions to ask yourself like "What do you enjoy" followed by inane suggestions like "Decorate your office". Cloying and without substance, this book fails to answer many core questions. What if your boss declines your request? What motivates an organization? How do you make lateral moves? Where are the examples of individuals who reengineered their work situation and how exactly they did it ? Granted, too many employees don't understand the work relationship or how to work an organization. But this is not the book that will address those issues. If you're still determined to read this book, my copy is up for sale on Amazon's used site 
 I have read some nonsense in my time... Wha?  But this book is just dreadful.  Only a complete jackass would put this book on their X-mas list... Wha? My friend Celine who is a complete nerd... Wha? would love  this book, but that is it... Wha 
 I really wanted to like this book.  I know that Holly as a character is written to be rather superficial. She's dazzled by big names and celebrity, whether it's Julia Child or famous dog trainers, fashionable street addresses, educational and dog institutions,  brand named dog food or titled pooches.  All have gotten her gushing approbation, and for the most part, her naive enthusiasm has been a fun ride.    The flip side is that she just as strongly sounds out against anything she doesn't like: cheap addresses and clothing, poor hygiene and personal habits, garish jewelry and stereotypical characterizations have all gotten a lot of page time. Most of the books in the series seem to rise or fall on a maniac/depressive line.  When Holly (or Susan?) is up, she gushes about what she loves (dogs usually, or whatever) the carping asides are minimal and the books are interesting and fun.   When she's down, the characters are drawn harshly and critically, Holly dwells on unpleasant details, asides and negative or even prejudiced descriptions and the book is not fun.   This book is not a happy one. Holly starts off the book being critical of her mother, surprisingly since formerly she always spoke of her in glowing terms.  But now she blames Marissa for posthumously causing her ring nerves, and for being a "hypercompetent martinet". I admit I got tired of Holly complaining in past books about her father, who seemed generally good hearted, and whose pull with the AKC she never hesitated to draw on when needed,  but was so embarrasing to her in other ways that she tried to avoid him the rest of the time. I was hoping after her marriage to Steve she'd reconcile more with Buck, grow up a little. Instead it seems she's now started after Marissa. Not that we couldn't read through the lines about that relationship in previous books, but at least Holly always spoke well of her. So that started off the book with a disappointing jolt.  Virtually every newly introduced character after that unauspicious start is dysfunctional as well, even the featured dog. And while praise of her own dogs usually adds amusement and uplift, there's very little of them in this book.  Instead Holly spends a lot of her time at "home" when she used to obsess over her dogs (or her email), instead obsessing over one of her many other pet peeves, weight, in the person of an overweight houseguest, describing how she throws out much of her own food, cooks green beens, and counts every bite the character eats. She actually uses the word  "disfigured" to describe her. Her own dogs come into it when one gorges on the guest's secret foodstash.  The other new characters are given the same unloving detail, with something dysfunctional brought up with all of them.  Without spoiling the plots to describe this, when *every* new character is introduced in a negative way, there's something wrong.  I'd hoped that Holly's obsession into negativity in the latter part of the series was due to her disappointment over Steve's marriage to another, or her previous head injury, or something related to a series plot that now that she was married to Steve or recovered from her concussion, the character's former likability would return.  I.e., a plot point. It would be hard to keep reading her otherwise. But instead of marriage soothing Holly's lapse into crabbiness, and swinging her mood up, the author seems now to be using Steve for more of the same critical asides.  Steve delivers a long lecture to the houseguest that sounds more like Holly "channeled" instead of his formerly mild mannered self.   People read series cozy mysteries for entertainment, and often for character development. Holly's character started out a bit strange, but often fun, and usually likeable.  Even the murderers at times had a redeeming quality or two.  But now Holly just isn't likeable, and even the non murderers are drawn harshly. She seems to see characters now always negatively, often stereotypically and sometimes in a downright prejudiced light that seems out of base with supposedly liberal Cambridge.  She has everything she could want, (except perhaps a bigger yard) but she continually finds faults to dwell on, to obsess over. If she's angry at her mother for being a "hypercritical martinet" she needs to stop channeling that critical nature in her own fictional life.  Or the author should stop channeling it in her books.   Carping isn't a very admirable quality in any character,  much less being entertaining.  A whole book of it without relief is not a pleasant or fun read.  I know this author has written good books, and I hope she gets over her funk and writes them again. This series deserves better,  as do the readers. But this book was not one of them.  
 A bit disappointing, in that it was supposed  to be of the same vain as 'The Matrix'. Cir- cuitry Man, with Vernon Wells, filmed in 1989  and released in 1990, beat this type of Sci-Fi  film to the punch. C.M./P.R:C.M. II does much more with less - as in less budget. Reeves should have instead done 'Point Break II'!! 
 The first few chapters got me up to speed on how to get around Flash and make simple animations, etc. However the last half of the book was too cursory and provided very little information on how to publish your Flash documents on the web. Additionally, many areas in this book are not up-to-date for Flash MX and instead actually refer to the Flash 5 version. My final recommendation is look for another intro Flash MX book because this one does a half-ass job, even for a Dummy for like me 
 What I expected was a well researched history of marriage laden with colorful commentary, humorous ironies, and insightful analysis.  What I discovered is a heavy-handed argument for gay and lesbian marriage that is tedious to slog through.  The author makes much of the fact that a)marriage has always been a strictly controlled institution that generally has financial implications; and b)that the institution has undergone constant, radical change.  Somehow, this is supposed to support the thesis that states should revise their laws to include same-sex marriage.  Somehow, I missed the logic.  On one hand, since marriage has always been strictly controlled by the state, where's the injustice in the fact that it is still strictly controlled by states who allow only heterosexuals to marry?  And on the other hand, while marriage has survived constant change through the ages, one thing has never changed: it has always been a heterosexual institution.  My bottom line: flawed logic expressed in a pedestrian writing style makes for very dull reading 
 We paid extra for expedited shipping in the hopes that the package would arrive on Saturday before Christmas or at the latest, the Tuesday after Christmas.  The package, in fact, did not arrive unitl after New Years and an email to the Seller went unanswered.  We felt that we should be reimbursed for the amount that we paid to have the expedited shipping 
 Two strong tracks are on this album: the Beatlesque "You" and the Spongetone-ish "Eight". Another listenable track is the early Beatle/Lennon influenced "Please Don't Tell". The remainder of the CD is basically mediocre, when compared to the goodly amount of fantastic power pop music available from better-focused bands like the Churchills, The Nines, Cotton Mather, Frisbie, and many more. I'd recommend you save your money on this album and try to get CD's by those bands. Hopefully, next time out, Swag will put together an album that is more consistent in quality from start-to-finish, with more tracks like the three I mentioned above, and not an album that sounds like it was just thrown together as a fun side project 
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 These new shows are mediocre at best. Nick made some quality shows 15-20 years ago. Put THESE on DVD and see what happens 
 This book is written on the level of People magazine and has a very  trendy feel to it.  I used this book at a top 25 law school and found it to be largely useless, if not detrimental 
 I was getting some boning too but didnt mind.  This ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in.  I wear mine all the time 
 ...and he'll tell you how to build a watch.  I was extremely disappointed in this book, not for its lack of content, but for its lack of focus.  I bought "Home Recording Power" hoping to learn tips and techniques to make the best audio recordings possible with my inexpensive home set-up.  While there were many helpful tips and tricks, I spent most of my reading skimming over superfluous explanations on the physics of sound waves, how MIDI works, how Microsoft Front Page works (???)and a re-hashing of much of my "Sonar User's Guide."  Can I record my electric guitar direct with an effects processor without an amp?  How do I hook up this mixing board to my soundcard's breakout box?  These and myriad other questions I went into the book asking never got answered.  Like so many other how-to manuals it runs the gamut between the insultingly simple to the unitelligibly advanced - for example, the author begins talking about boosting EQ values by specific db amounts but he never tells you what equipment he uses to do this or how it's done.  It wasn't all a waste, however, I did pick up a few tips that I hadn't known before and bought the recommended Rode NT1 microphone that was touted several times.  Overall disappointing 
 Beautiful voice, but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd.  I was offended just reading every name on this cd...It is really a shame, what  pretty "vulgar" voice.  If this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears.  You should be ashamed of yourself as an artist, as you have such power, but it is spent on prepetuating hate.  Nina Simone was a angry artist also, but not once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america.  The first song I ever heard of hers "Mississippi Goddam" made me cry, so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice.  There will always be a "racist america" because people are selfish, but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist.  I liked the cd until I heard the lyrics, one less sale adds up after awhile 
 I like Japanese films, and really wanted to like this one. However I must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot. Now I have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day. If that is true I might give it a higher rating. As of now however, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense 
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 Whatever you do, do NOT buy this film. This is not Drunken Master 1 or 2. As a matter of fact Jackie Chan isn't even the star.(he's only in about 5 minutes of the movie.And, that's a clip from another movie!)The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the film has mediocore action 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 A bookish English exchange student (Maxwell Caulfield) transforms himself into a "cool rider" in order to win the heart of a Pink Lady (Michelle Pfeiffer).  This sequel to the excellent "Grease" is simply embarrassing.  It pales to the original in every conceivable way.  The cast is painfully inadequate.  Even Pfeiffer shows little indication of the talent she would later prove to have.  A few of the musical numbers show promise, but the soundtrack consists mostly of stinkers like "Cool Rider" and "Who's That Guy."  Avoid this at all costs 
 I must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of Shakespear's world and plays. They are very good and intertaining but I must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations (in detail)of people having sex. The book is probably very good if you like reading text books, and don't mind these pictures, but I was just too grossed out. If you are teaching Lit in college and/or studying Shakespeare, this is probably the book that you should use, but you should flip through the book first (i.e: library, book store) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves. 
 Tao Teh Ching is a monumental work.  Unlike other religious texts, the Tao Teh Ching is barely 5000 letters spread over 81 single-page poetic passages.  You can probably read thru it in a couple hours or less.  But for the serious reader, it can take a lifetime of study and contemplation.  In ancient times, scholars in China and Korea really did spend a lifetime on this one text, not only sudying, but transcribing it, discussing it, and abiding by its tenets in their daily lives.  I've myself pored over it many times in Chinese, Korean and now English, and every time I read it I cannot but be amazed by the wisdom of Lao Tse (or, as some allege, the group of people who contributed to this text).  The problem with English, or I suppose any language not associated with Chinese, is that it is almost impossible to translate Tao Teh Ching with sufficient coherency.  Chinese words are each and all very efficient, in that virtually every single "letter" is replete with meaning.  Therefore, whereas the Chinese may use 10 words to describe something, English might require 10 times that words to adequately translate the meaning.  For example, in the second passage, third stanza, the translated text says, "therefore, the Sage manages his affairs without Ado."  What does "without Ado" mean?  In chinese this is stated in two letters as "Mu Wi" - non-action.  It does not mean to sit back and not participate or instigate any activity.  Rather, "Mu Wi" means doing things in a very natural, spontaneous way that is not forced, does not create conflict and has no secular motives.  As there are no secular motives behind the action, it is as if the Sage does not "act" in the way other poeple act.  His actions are like breathing, and almsot imperceptible; thus it is as if he does not act.  Concepts like "Mu Wi" and "Mu Ji" - non-knowledge - abound in Tao Teh Ching.  These cannot simply be translated away with a couple english words.  In short, a Tao Teh Ching ranslation requires pages and pages of footnotes to accurately reflect the rich meaning behind every passage.  Moreover, many passages can be read in more than one way.  In fact, different translations sometimes say radically different things about the same passage precisely because of this ambiguity.  Any serious translation of Tao Teh Ching should point these out.  Tao Teh Ching is very concise, and written in a poetic style.  But unless you are versed in ancient Chinese language and tomes, you should really consult the literally thousands of guides that scholars wrote over the years to help you read thru the text.  Tao Teh Ching is not some kind of Buddhist sutra that you can just recite over and over without knowing what it means.  It is deeply profound and rich with hidden subtexts.  In China and Korea many of these guides - some of them more than a thousand years old - still survive.  I've yet to find an enligsh guide.  But I am sure they exist.  PLease find them; refrain from reading the translation by itself, for most times all you will see are a jumble of meaningless words 
 Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like 
 This book is not written for those of us that have been overindulging for years.  It is written for the folk that are on the verge of becomming an alcoholic.  "You must still be in the early stages of problem drinking" "You've engaged in problem drinking for 5 years or less"  It is stated numberous times in the first few chapters that the program is not for problem drinkers.  She goes on to define the alcoholic, and state again that her program is not for YOU!  I want my money back 
 Although some of the assisted exercises might work well, I found many of the other stretches inflamed a number of joints after several weeks on this program.  The solo stretching exercises seem to be poorly researched 
 I ordered this book because of the reviews but the reviews are for a different book!  This book is basically a calendar that you use to fill in what you ate and what exercise you did and note how it made you feel.  It is a companion book to The Chemistry of Success.  I bought it used so I'm not out alot of money and its my own fault for not reading the editors reviews more carefully.    
 There is an annoying New Agey belief grown out of religious quests for redemption and salvation that states that not only can everyone be saved, everyone is wonderful and only big mean society makes them act badly. This is the kind of thinking that allows bad men (and women) to empty out bank accounts, kill their spouses and excuse every one of their actions.   This movie takes an intriguing concept - Portrait of Hitler as a Young Artist - and sinks it into the morass of this kind of thinking. He's an angry man trying to make it in the art world, but basically he's a good kid. He just needs a patron to support him. Unfortunately that patron gets the tar beat out of him before he can show Hitler's Autobahn as art. So Hitler decided to go with the more validating politics thing and see where that got him.   Not only do you never get the feeling that Hitler is anti-semitic or dangerous in this movie, you never get the feeling that he was a man capable of using rhetoric to excite or sway audiences. This is a man that convinced an entire country to commit mass murder and this movie portrays him as a slug.  Furthermore, Hitler never seems to take any responsibility for his actions. I know that sounds silly, but this movie has Hitler walking around, making speeches, drawing pictures and somehow the rising Nazism in Germany has nothing to do with him. It's just happening outside of his realm.   Worse, John Cusack plays the role as Rob Gordan from High Fidelity. Cusack is a good actor, but this movie takes place in 1918, not 1999. The character is not an angsty record store owner; he's a veteran whose seen more death than most can imagine. The movie doesn't even draw on the relationship between Max and Hitler as fellow veterans.  At the end of the movie you're left with the impression that Hitler was a sad little boy who could have been a great artist if only given half a chance. But instead, he went to the big speech making and killed half of Europe. Doesn't really play well.  For a good movie about Hitler that focuses on both Hitler as a person and a force of history (and a man capable of wooing others to his cause) try to see if the CBS miniseries starring Robert Carlisle of Trainspotting fame is available. 
 1. It didn't teach me anything I hadn't already read in other books or learned on my own.  2. Stressed the importance of medication and ignored the plight of those (like me) who have tried pretty much every med on the market and experienced no relief from symptoms.  3. I was personally offended by the brief discussion of antidepressant side effects which, when mentioning sexual dysfunction, focused solely on MALE sexual dysfunction and completely ignored the fact that most females on antidepressants cease to experience orgasms. Apparently I'm a filthy whore who shouldn't be concerned with my sexual enjoyment 
 This is a very readable mystery with several cute twists.  If you live in or near the central coast of California you will love the way she works in many points of interest.  The story is filled with love of man-woman, mankind and dog.  You'll love it 
 I, rarely, have ditched a book in midstream. But it was something I found myself doing with this one. I was looking for a Vonnegut look-a-like and I was sorely dissapointed.  Not really sure why I was pointed to Eggers though. The book consists of several short stories that, I may say, are elloquently written (the only reason for the 2 stars). The main problem is, they never go anywhere. Each and every one of them have open endings that conclude nothing, finnish nothing, and lead aimlessly to the point where you would much rather close the book for a sense of closure than find out how it actually ends 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 The beats on this record are repeatitive and the rhymes lack the creativity for the most part that you expect out of Kool Keith. This is a tough record to listen to in its entirety because of the thick monotony of the music.   The best songs are the Sex songs, and if that is the primary reason you like Keith's work than maybe its worth checking out. If you're looking for some of his new stuff to hear, I'd recommend Disel Truckers before the Lost Masters. 
 I really needed this book and after I ordered it I thought great. Then days later I got an email saying They didnt have it so I was being credited. If you dont have the book DONT POST IT! 
 Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest 
 Some of you may be familiar with the movie that bears the same name as this book. It shares a lot of instances with the movie, even though it takes place on a smaller sloop instead of a frigate. Several movie scenes were derived from the book, including some instances of dinner time banter, as well as the rigging of a decoy raft for the purpose of throwing off a pursuer at night.  The story follows Jack Aubrey as he finally receives a ship to command, a 14 gun sloop captured from the Spanish, and named the Sophie. He acquires a valuable friend through his love of music, named Stephen Maturin, who turns out to be a physician and an amateur naturalist. The battlefield is the Mediterranean Sea, and the home base is Gibraltar. Most of the book deals with the extraordinary success of the Sophie as a merchant raider taking various prizes across the southern coast of Spain and France, culminating in her greatest feat, the capture of the Spanish frigate Cacafuego (which translates just how you imagine it would), a much larger, more powerful vessel. There doesn't seem to be a great driving plot to the story other than a telling of events, along with a few side-plots which seem to be only of mere cursory importance, largely due to O'Brian's writing style.  Patrick O'Brian writes in a style that's hard to follow, partly because it's written in the English of the time, and partly because it's exceptionally dry for what someone would expect from a war novel. The concept was very sound, but I had a hard time feeling as inspired about what was happening, without closing my eyes and adding my own visuals to the plot, and imbellishing the passion behind a lot of the action. This is illustrated by a few of the instances that were adapted to the screen for the movie featuring Aubrey. For one example, while speaking about his encounters with Lord Nelson, I remembered the setting vividly from the movie, with the decent performance from Russell Crowe, and the reactions and faces of the men around him while they listened. The gravity of the moment was very well portrayed. In the book, it passed like the droll reading of a ship's log. His story was stuffed in a paragraph of speech and passed as dryly as everything else, with hardly any descriptive detail given to Jack's reverence for the subject, or the emotional reactions of those listening. So much of the book is like that, so it helped me to keep a running movie in my head, adding much needed descriptive seasoning to what I was reading.  The book had its high points, and even a few amusing points. O'Brian seems to write better when there isn't much in the way of action going on. Though, at times, the characters have a hard time just being direct with one another, and in effect, the reader has to be sharp enough to read between the lines of what they're saying to get the real meaning. A case in point was when Stephen was examining Jack, only to declare that his problem had to do with the woman he was sleeping with, Captain Harte's wife, had been surprisingly friendly all around. I don't know if I'm supposed to derive from this that Jack had contracted a venerial disease, or if it was simply a warning about the threat of Harte's grudge. Either way, I wish that in this, and in many other instances, O'Brian had made the effort to make things more clear.  The book left me without the urge to continue the series. Maybe I'm an uncultured bafoon, but I'm not going to force myself to read things that don't appeal to my sense of entertainment. I don't think I should have to envision descriptive imbellishments and then hope I'm correct, in order to feel enthralled by the books I read 
 Honestly, tell me what is musical about this. The only thing that changes through any of these "songs" are the lyrics.  Let's summarize: some tub of goo talking about being a low-life to the same beat for a few minutes at a time. I'll stick with music 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 Although the illustrations are lovely and we both love unicorns, the story was just not good.  It was also too descriptive in places for the age range listed.  The story is about mankind destroying the forests and a lot of dialogue between the unicorn and the little girl.  It was really just plain boring 
 Bad Boy did a horrible job with this album.  There are some good songs (maybe 2-3), but over all this album is wack 
 If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader 
 This is true even of the 1936 version...This book simply couldint keep my attention! I had to force myself to finish it, or else I'd have felt I had wasted the [money} paid to get it! Only get it to complete youre collection of Applewoods...Don't put youreself through this "adventure".. 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 This is a pleasant film to look at as far as the pretty girls and the colorful scenes.  However that's about all the good things I can say about it.  I can think of a lot better things that the pretty girls in this movie could have done besides getting their faces burned off, getting killed by a walking suit of armor, etc..  There's a diary involved but what exactly is in this diary I still have no idea.  Maybe I lost something with the English dubbing.  Once I lost the point about the diary there was no hope of understanding the plot.    There's some cocaine use involved somewhere but where that all fits in I don't know.  The ending is anticlimactic and really not possible from a logical point of view.  I don't want to ruin the 'suspense' by  telling what happens.  Based on reading the high praises of other reviewers I may not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie.  Give me "Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman" or "Brides Of Blood" any day over this movie.  Jeff Marzano  Recommended further viewing:  Horror Hotel IT !

 This book is not up to the quality of How the Irish Saved Civilization.  Too much of his writing is merely quoting sources.  Actually it is rather boring 
 Crossing to Avalon is part of the Goddess Movement that many women are finding after being raised in male-dominated religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Goddess of Ms. Bolen is almost a material, earthy Person as opposed to the spiritual sky God. The author makes several interesting points about opening oneself to Spirit and accepting the Body as sacred as a monstrance or a shrine. Other reviewers have given their opinions on the strengths of this book, so I will not repeat them here.   The book has many of the same weaknesses as others in the Goddess genre. Avalon posits that before the horrible men got into power and forced their horrible male gods on us, everyone worshipped a Goddess figure and celebrated female things like menstruation, menopause, birth, etc. There was little violence and women ruled over men with their profound wisdom and magic powers.   It does not bother Ms. Bolen, who is a psychiatrist, that there was no writing from these times and therefore no way to really know what the people said or did about almost anything. Feminist spirituality devotees can write a novel about a little figurine that looks like a pregnant (or perhaps obese) female and turn it into the Venus of Willendorf. Reality on the historical front is not as important as creating a misanthropic mythology that puts the Female front and center. I doubt Ms. Bolen would be as open-minded about the medical information she reads in psychiatric review journals. She would want footnotes and facts and testing done, something that is not a part of Goddess History.   I found Ms. Bolen's musings on pregnancy, birth, breast feeding, and menstruation to be fanciful. I doubt that it was "patriarchy" that decided to call menstruation "the curse." I imagine it was coined by women who were sick and tired of bloating and cramping every single month and feeling exhausted and bitchy. There is a reason the birth control pill that allows a woman to bleed only once or twice a year is wildly popular. A lot of male-created religions have menstrual taboos and I used to think they were ridiculous until I thought, "perhaps women started them to give us an excuse to take a break once a month. 'Make dinner? I'm on my period; you know I can't touch your food/go to the mosque/have sex with you for a week!'"   Ms. Bolen's ideology of Body as Sacred ignores that it is our Body that we have in common with every other mammal, and it is only our Minds that have evolved beyond them. A dog menstruates, gives birth, and suckles. It is precisely our Body that gives us a disadvantage to men -- before antibiotics and hospital births, women died years and years before men. Before chemical birth control a woman could expect to become pregnant every year until menopause, and traditional families all over the world had more kids than you can count with your fingers. Before formula, children sometimes died because their mothers did not make enough milk to sustain them. Women are on the average smaller, weaker, and slower than men. This sort of feminist spirituality seems to take what makes us vulnerable to "patriarchal oppression" and celebrate it. It reminds me of Buffy the Vampire, where anorexic Sarah Michelle Gellar would fight off males who could have snapped her neck in a second and not broken a sweat. THAT is the reality of the female body.   I admit that I hold to an Aristotelian view of the Primacy of the Mind and not the Body, and I am not an epiphenominalist as I think Jean Bolen appears to be. This influences the way I read books like this. I get the impression as I read that Ms. Bolen is soooo spiritual that she can miss that "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar." Women consoling each other becomes a Goddess infusion in her mind, rather than the very physical brain response that people and animals get when touched and comforted. The fact that the author is a psychiatrist interests me, since she does not appear to hold that emotions and responses are related to a physical brain but are instead part of a numinous Thing that lives within us, perhaps the Goddess. 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 We all have different taste and I am trying to consider this. But to me this is just another artist who had a strange idea and we are bying it and help him to live a good life. Nickelodeon and even the Disney channel featuring him. My little girl and I listened to two songs that they played on the Disney channel over and over.Malti is the song she really started to listen to. Honestly. The only reason why that song is so great is Barbara's voice and singing ability. Dave can't sing and shouldn't even try to sing in Spanish. The tune is catchy and we find us humming along. SO I ordered this CD. What a joke. Most of the time you can't evne understand what he is saying and it is not as if he came up with new songs. He has the known children songs for the most part and just puts his own twist on it. But it is not entertaining for little ones.My daughter keeps asking: What is this? Till Malti comes on and then she and I are relieved and hum along with joy and glee. Thank you Barbara for saving this song. I even bought another CD thinking perhaps I just got a bad one and the next are better. I am disappointed with that one as well. So you take a song like Somewhere over the rainbow and put a new rythm on it. Wopee. I like it but it isn't worth it to me and I admit I have no idea or clue who this artist is and where he came from and what his background is but honestly.. he is overrated and sold. There is a song with Cheryl Crow on it. Okay. SO I am thinking this will be fun perhaps. Only to find that I want to shake him and her for again not putting some fun and step and pep into a song. I guess I am not a alternative and don't appreciate the earthy balance the musicians bring to the music. I want some rythm and clap your hands together and sing along type of music for my children. This type of stuff is something a teenager can appreicate later on only that the songs are too young for them at that time. My children have NO clue what this is about and can't figure it out. And we listen to everything from Disney to Classic, to Broadway. YOu name it. So we are not just Sesame Street CD lovers. But this music is a joke. No talent. ONE tone of voice and as if he forgets to open his teeth while singing. Barbar saves this CD but what a waste of money for ONE song. DON"T BUY IT. And all these people who fall for it.. grrrr. It is like a art gallerie. Everyone stands in front of the picture that shows a green dot. And they come up with tons of explanations what it may be and how fantastic the artist is. And in reality he is sitting back and chuckling because he just ran short of a painting and spilled his paint brush while cleaning it. Give me a break. Shame on Disney and Nickelodeon to fall into this as well. And taking out great singers and shorten real talents opportunity. WOw, guess you can tell I am not into it. ;0(  Explore, again.. everyone has different taste. But I just don't get it, nor like it. I find it horrible.    
 Dr. Milner is correct that adolescents "lack...power over the central features of their lives." One power I wish teens had is to prevent portrayals such as this.  This book is an exercise in unreality. Adults are charged with "inadvertently" exercising the wrong kinds of controls over teenagers, which excuses adults from facing the fact that our own values and behaviors--not what structures or lectures we aim at adolescents--are the most critical influences on the young.  "Why do American teenagers behave the way they do?" Dr. Milner asks. The USA has 30 million teenagers, ranging from Hmong migrant laborers to middle-class Latinos to Marin upscalers (note: the last are the only ones culture critics care about). No responsible social scientist uses a term such as "behave the way they do" to describe such a large, diverse group.  "Why are many teenagers obsessed with who sits with them at lunch, the brand of clothes they wear, what parties they are invited to, the privacy of their bedrooms, the intrigues of school cliques, who is dating or breaking up with whom, what is the latest popular music?" he asks. Because adults around them are obsessed with the same kinds of status markers. Hard to believe, but teens account for just 3% of consumer spending in the US. Who accounts for the other 97%? That's right--the parents, educators, and adults Dr. Milner depicts as so disturbed and baffled at where teenagers could possibly get the idea that what clothes you wear, what styles you affect, who you associate with, what circles you are included in, what other people's sex lives are like, etc., are important. Dr. Milner treats adults simply as controllers and arbiters, not as role models whose own smoking, drinking, sexual behavior, fashion consciousness, status seeking, and cliquishness crucially impact those of the young. This is a fatally un-introspective book.  Dr. Milner asks: "Why have alcohol, drug use, and casual sex become widespread?" They haven't. These behaviors have declined sharply among teens in recent decades and, more important, consequences of such behaviors (drunken driving, drug overdose, pregnancy) have plummeted among today's adolescents compared to previous generations. Today's parents have far worse illegal-drug and alcohol abuse problems than their teenage kids do. The question is: why doesn't a noted social scientist such as Dr. Milner know these things?  This book perfectly illustrates the hierarchical arrangements of grownup society Dr. Milner is so troubled by when reflected by adolescents. Where "cool kids" distance themselves from "geeks," Milner distances adults (high status) from adolescents (low status). Where popular high schoolers view outcasts as being weird, different, messing up the school, and requiring insults and thumpings from the alphas to restore the proper order, Milner charges teens with objectionable, unhealthy values that are messing up our society and require superior adults to reassert our corrective authority. When it comes to us versus them, power versus reject, meaningful achievement versus superficial status, painful introspection versus blaming scapegoats, and every other flaw we see so clearly in teenagers but are blind to in ourselves, Dr. Milner's book inadvertently illustrates the degree to which high schoolers anticipate grownups and grownups recapitulate high school.

 God, I can't believe this guy. Ja Rule was never a gangsta in his life, he can't talk gangsta. And stop trying to be like Tupac, Tupac actually was a gangsta. Your a fake and if he was still alive he would not only not role with you but diss you so badly you'd wet your pants. This guy should be booted out of the game, not only his he lying when he talks all this gangsta s*** as if he went through it, his ruining hip hop. Yeah and Ja, stop dissing Eminem and 50. You know perfectly well that they'd kill you in a battle anyday. Ja Rule has always been s***. Go listen to real rap 
 I bought this book along with the Zombie Survival guide based on the reader recommendations here as I wanted something a bit out of the ordinary to read. I'd have to say this is by far the worse of the 2.  Unlike the Zombie Survival Guide, which actually reads like a real factual book, this one is just lacking. I realise its a parody book, but there wasn't a huge amount of detail or humor involved. Maybe it's aimed at a younger age group or possibly someone with a minimal knowledge of super heroes and comics, I don't know, but as an adult who was an avid comic book reader in my younger years it failed to make the grade. It just didn't quite capture me, I read it on and off over a couple of weeks and don't feel the urge to read the last few chapters.  Maybe if it was sanctioned by Marvel or DC comics giving it more liscence to refer to more specific characters it would have been a better nostalgia peice, in its current form it reads like a weak joke stretched way too far 
 Wow, I hate to go against the tide but I felt very strongly about this book and unfortunately, not positively. I read this book aloud to my 13 year old daughter as part of our homeschool curriculum and both of our general impressions of this book were similarly negative to the point that we were glad to reach the last page and be done with it. We both found the book to be poorly written, the plot to be extremely predictable, the character development to be lacking, the dialog of the characters and the plot line to be unrealistic,the character motivations to be unclear and the historical inaccuracies to be glaring. The plot was clearly contrived from the very beginning to the end. At the final page we were relieved to be through but frustrated that we wasted our time and confused as to all the loose ends left by the author. I certainly would not personally recommend this book.   
 Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
 This stuff has a very strong smell -- like WD-40 or something.  If you can stand the smell, you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt.  I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless, like all other treadmill lubricant I've bought.  But it isn't odorless.  It really stinks.  I don't like that permeating smell in my house, especially in my workout room.  I recommend the LifeSpan 100% silicone lubricant.  It's a little pricier for the quantity you receive, but it's the good (odorless) stuff

 it's a good book for people who want to know the simplest method for growing the mushrooms. it's only dedicate to Stropharia cubensis 
 This album is mainly for big time guitar fans. Of course Robben Ford is a very talented guitar player but I find this one rather slow and very boring. I can hear one or two songs at a time, then I just can't stand it! The music of Robben Ford is a blend of blues, jazz, funk, and I'm almost certain that most of his fans are guitar players themselves. I'd buy "Handful of blues" instead of this one 
 This book was rather boring and so is the next one.  I think it is because roger lea macbride didn't totally write this himself.  He passed away before he finished these two books 
 Probably strictly for those weird Richard Ford groupies you see at literary festivals (they must be the ones below telling you how great the pre-reviews have been--oh come on!) I'm sure these folks will welcome this last installment of the Frank Bascombe saga, as they do anything this usually engaging if often clumsy writer does. This epic may end with a whimper but for those who just don't want it to end there is at least the consolation that it's considerably longer than the earlier books. Some good moments of Ford's dry wit here, but most of the extra length is devoted to sad  ramblings in Frank's confused head.  Lots of fine American writers have succeeded portraying the heroism of the common man, but Ford seems to expect us to celebrate the common man's late-life tediousness.  That may be everyman's fate, but it's too much to ask from someone buying a book in good faith.  In the end, I wound up wishing I had stopped with Independence Day.  I could have imagined the next chapter in this life with more satisfaction than I derived from reading this droning lackluster finale. I'll give it 2 stars for sentimental reasons--guess I can't help having some compassion for guys getting old without a clue 
 This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.  It  drags on like a rusty knife for far to many pages.  The book could have been good, could have saved itself if it had ended on page 152 instead of page 195.  The story after 152 is irrelevant, pointless, lacks continuity, and ultimately leaves the reader wondering why it was included.  Instead of the sad story of the young writer, you end up with that plus a monologue in which the author attempts to build sympathy for himself, justify his existence, and generally prove that at 50 he amounted to something 
 The majority of this book is empty exposition.  People move about meaningless lives without purpose.  The "protagonist" merely drifts through a life which offers him a potential to engage at every turn, which he either doesn't recognize, actively avoids.  When he IS finally forced to take action, the plot is cliche, but you figure, you hope, you PRAY that it will be redeemed by something in the end.  Meanwhile you've got an antagonist that was lifted almost directly from The Karate Kid.  The "twist" ending never validates a single one of the pages you've wasted your life reading, and ultimately adds up to a useless stack of paper with no soul or meaning.  True Story: The moment I finished reading this book, I stood up, strolled across the lunchroom, and threw it into the garbage can, so no one would ever need waste brain cells on its pages again.  I hate Ransom like I hate Illinois Nazis.  Read ANYTHING else 
 Janet Evanovich has become a much better writer since writing this book....I prefer her Stefanie Plum series and hope she doesn't give up on them. 
 This book sets out to tell that it was Jackie Kennedy's mother that instilled strength in her daughter. What she acctually did was instill a self-hatred. There is a great book called "Mrs. Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years" by Barbara Leaming. In that book the author states repeatedly that her mother treated her older daughter horribly. Onassis's mother would tell her daughter that her hair was too kinky and she had big feet her eyes were too big, her hands were too big and that no man would marry her because she was so unattractive in every way. Her mother may have been saying these things to make sure her daughter would act wisely so she could land a man, but it is obvious that these taunts had a neg. effect on her daughter. Onassis thought that her marriage to JKF was a faliure because she believed his cheating was the result of all the neg. things she thought she was, all those neg. things her mother said she was. Jackie thought that she had to stick out the marrage because she was lucky to have found a man that could look past her "ugly" looks. Hopefully the readers of this book will not be suckered into believing that this woman, Janet A. was a great woman. She was cruel to many people. The only good thing I can say about the subject is that she is a prime example of how far woman have come in this society. From being raised as Janet A. was to "land a man" to finding fullfilment within and not through wealth and marraige 
 bestseller -Stupid plot -horrible plot -dumb characters  I have one conculsion Matthew reilly was trying to buy up all the copies of this book to save himself from embrassmen 
 OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.  No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays 
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 buckethead is the greatest guiarist who ever lived and doesn't get the credit, but this is an absolutly terrible album.  I liked Nottingham Lace and the hand and i liked We are one, but the rest was either screamy or boring.(however the interlude was pretty funny). this was my first buckethead album, because i just picked a random cd and bought it (RLY STUPID IDEA) If u dont actualy like buckethead and you absolutly had to get an album of his get this, but if you like the instrumentals then get something else and download nottingham lace. Don't let this be your first album because a person who truly appreciates guitar would be automaticly turned off 
 Keller Williams is a fine FINE acoustic guitar player.  I can't deny him that.  However, after seeing him live, I can't say I will ever see him again.  Too much looping, too much cheese and not enough grit.  Light and fluffy.  Maybe you could call it bubble gum music.   I'm not turned off to the jamband scene.  That's not it at all.  I was a Phish fan for many years...going back to the late eighties.  I really enjoy improvisation.  My musical life revolves around it, whether I'm playing or listening, whether its jazz, free or jamming.  I love it all.  I just find Keller Williams and a lot of the bands (not that he's a band really) that are in the "jam" scene to be pretty boring.  At least Keller doesn't go on twenty minute quasi-bluegrass noodle jams 
 The author lacks of moral clarity in the issue of the Middle East.  It seems that the only democracy in that region has the fault of everything. As Mr. Sharansky explain in his last book, "The power of Democracy.....", there is at least two  ways to know when something is anti-Semitic.  1) when someone compare attitudes as diabolic.  Ej: compare Israel politics as Nazis, or the way Israelis treats Palestinian as Auschwitz (Saramago). 2)  when someone like Mr. Swisher critics  the attitudes of a Nation o people, but says nothing about the same attitude in others country or people.  It seems in these books, that Palestinian terror does not exist, that suicide terrorist take places in another planet. And yes, despite the many interviews he made, witch are interesting in many cases, this book is anti-Semitic and anti Israel, with no sustainable bases.  
 The first album was great. But this one left me wanting more and expecting a lot better songs. I got to listen to the CD for free and have no desirer to buy it. The 10th. song was listed as a bonus track. Why would they want to release a CD with only 9 songs. The whole CD lasted around 40 mins. and is over before you know it. They could have done a better job and put some better songs on it. I was really looking for this to be the best one yet. Maybe next time.   This album is great for first timers that never listen to IL DIVO, but fans beware 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 Bought this toaster less than two months ago and it's already broken. The control buttons (one of the reasons why we bought it) are not functioning, neither is the darkness control knob. Once it's put into the toast position, it does not shut off, you have to push up the lever manually. My son put in some Toaster Swirls only to set off the smoke alarm. This is the second time a product (a rice cooker)from this brand has broken within months of purchase. I'm just going to avoid Oster at all costs in the future 
 This book seems to have been written by the ghostwriter. There's so much filler and nonsense in this book, and a real lack of depth, unlike original VC works.   This is about the life of Chris and Cathy's grandmother, Olivia, and their grandfather, Malcolm. It's what you would expect: Malcolm is cold and ruthless, and he hardens Olivia's heart as well. Corrine and Christopher get together, and everything is ruined for the Foxworths. Come on...we already knew this from the first book; why did we need this one? If you're a true fan and want to read all of this saga, go ahead. But if you end up as bored as I was with it, you won't read it twice.   
 I love Celine Dion's music.  Even though Mariah Carey is my all-time favorite I still love Celine's incredible voice.  However she does have her misses... like this album. I am a huge fan of her Self-titled, "Falling Into You" and "Let's Talk About Love" albums. Unfortuantely I didn't enjoy this. It didn't seem like it was from the heart.  it seemed like it was made for mass appeal like her debut album.  The only songs I really liked was "The Power of Love"--one of her best singles. I'm being VERY generous for giving this 2 stars. The only reason I'm doing it is because of the "Power of Love." I'd reccomend "Celine Dion", "Falling Into You" or "Let's Talk About Love" over this anyday. D 
 The book was fun but the fact that it is too long overshadowed all this fun. I got the impression it was rather written to become a movie. All I can say is that thanks to C.Bushnell for 'Sex and the City'. 
 I got my first month(a horrible Green Day issue)and then nothing! Uh,what up? Its not that good of a magazine,I just want what I paid for 
     If conservatives who attend church regularly TRULY donate MORE, why is it that when my Democratic group was collecting FOR THE TROOPS, (women wanted scrapbooking materials) I called a girl I know who has done scrapbooking parties for years, a Republican, attends church on Sundays, and asked if she had any loose items she could donate, she NEVER SENT A THING! Not one sticker! Nothing! FOR THE TROOPS!!! As I do much in the area of crafts myself, I know all the excess materials left over from projects, yet this woman gave NOTHING to be sent to our female troops serving in Iraq!!! Please, someone explain where this authors' theory even comes close to being explained here! So is it that Republicans will DENY a moral and decent donation going DIRECTLY to the BENEFICIARIES if they simply don't care for the group behind the donating??? Then it's heck on the troops!!! NICE!     Or explain the woman who answered phone at local Catholic church and during discussion said, "Why should rich pay for the poor?" I am to believe this woman donates to the needy???     How about doing some research on the author before believing all you read when he himself contradicts his OWN WORDS and CLAIMS! http[...]  Question from Marilyn, small Midwestern college:     Are these two possibilities: Republicans have more money and need the tax write-offs and are more often sought out by charities; some people who describe themselves liberals (like me) share money in ways that are not recognized as charity (such as helping friends put their children through college or helping a physically handicapped co-worker pay for appropriate housing)? My husband and I also served for two years in a Christian volunteer service project, which has, as we knew it would, affected our long-term earnings and hence our retirement income.  Arthur C. Brooks:     Thanks, Marilyn. There's no evidence that conservatives look for (or receive) tax write-offs more than liberals do. But to your other point, it is always possible that folks like you tend to give in different ways from conservatives - ways that are not picked up in the data. The evidence is pretty incomplete on this point, although it suggests that conservatives actually give informally in some ways more than liberals (e.g. giving blood). But it is always possible that, in other ways, they give less. I am open to this possibility and believe it needs more study. 
 Great texbook.  However, has too many mistakes.  Answers are not reliabl 
 Ghyka attempts to show the objects in nature are not randomly formed; he begins the with the concept of ratio and proportion in the plane; the golden section; and then to the regular polygons and geometric shapes in 3 dimensions.  Then he rambles onto hypothesizing why an architecture design may seem striking. In doing so he makes gross assumptions which are to the point of being forced to fit his theories.  The basic concepts that he delves; one can familiarize oneself with by a quick reference on the internet. Hence I do not recommend spending the time and money to read this book.  
 ignorance and propaganda run amok...a good movie for a lot of american dumb guys who like war movies just because they're war movies...the nazi's made films like this in the 1930's with the poles portrayed just like the vietnamese are in this film...the vietnamese boy in this movie is named ham chunk???  are you kidding me???  the sad part is no...they're not kidding...which makes this movie all the more revolting...but i see it's quite popular...which is informative as to how george w. bush got into the white house and why american soldiers are now bogged down in iraq...the same war mongering fat heads who didn't "get it" (understand the consequences of putting your big american nose in other people's business) then, don't get it now.  Winston Churchill warned, "those who do not remember their past are damned to repeat it"...a fine vintage vietnam war movie for simple minded viewers...remember freedom is not free...freedom to make millions of dollars from selling weapons and war materials to the government costs citizens billions of dollars...this movie stinks...unless your sophisticated taste enjoys war as entertainment.. 
 I've contacted the manufacturer... for an alternative way to hook to crib.  They were less than helpful.  I am thinking about returning the entire set I'm so disappointed 
 ... The "collage of voices" approach endemic to oral history leads in this case to a frustrating, almost indigestible mess. Dave Marsh warns in his editor's note to the For The Record series of which this volume is a part, "if an artist isn't especially interested in what happens in the recording studio but has a fascination with what happens in hotel rooms after live gigs, that's what you'll get." So, instead of getting more than the barest glimpse inside the studio during the recording of There's A Riot Going On, surely one of the deepest albums in all of American popular music history, we are given page after page devoted to the band's sex lives, taste in drugs, and even their surprising if unilluminating avocation as collective dog fanciers (really!). What's missing, literally, is Sly's voice, which leaves a gaping hole in the center of the narrative. By connecting the dots one can glean a few insights about the music from the mass of bleary anecdotes herein, but aren't authors and editors supposed to do that for you? If you're in the market for a mess of depressing gossip, this will be your meat; if you're seeking insight into the man's (and the group's) brilliant music, look elsewhere 
 I purchased this book and would like to quote a paragraph from the second page of the INTRODUCTION! "Finally, the games get parents more involved in their children's education.  I realize that many parents are shy about teaching their children and feel that teaching should be left to teachers.  In general, I agree; but parents do teach their children in many areas every day - perhaps without realizing it.  They teach children to throw a football, cross a street, make a bed or a sandwich; they help with homework, and there's even a method of violin instruction that has parents practice along with their children.  Why shouldn't they help with reading, too - in a fashion that doesn't interfere with school?"  Parents should leave teaching to the teachers??  Is she crazy?  Does she view parents as incompetent idiots?  Toss a football, make a sandwich???  I intend to take full responsibility for my child's education.  It will not involve this book!    She is suggesting that I should teach my child in a way that does not interfere with school?  What does that mean????  There are some serious issues here and as I stated above, this is in the introduction!  I would NOT recommend this book.  I would recommend that Ms. Kaye show respect for parents and the integral role they play in a child's education.  Teachers are secondary not foremost in this process 
 This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers.  It's as if he published this because he needed money.  There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.  I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up 
 I think this is one of the worst textbooks I've ever read. It uses 14 different sentences to say the same thing, and makes basic concepts seem complicated by overstating/analyzing them. This book could be significantly shorter...maybe the author was getting paid by the word?  If you have any choice of textbooks for macroeconomics class, I recommend you choose one other than this. If you're the professor of the class, I beg you to not make your students endure this book. :) Thank you 
 Very low quality and I am very surprised that Kitchenaid puts its name on this product.  I highly DO NOT reccommend this product.  I agree with all the other reviews about this product and was in denial until I bought one myself 
 It has been well said that, "With how much ease, believe we what we wish."  John G. Jackson and his "American Atheist" comrades exemplify these words with the production of this book.  If anyone were to  take the time to check the references in Mr. Jackson's work, one would find  that a good majority of the authors he cites are either biased against  Christianity or have questionable scholarship (e.g., he depends heavily on  one "scholar" who mainly has honorary degrees, not earned ones).   That in itself speaks volumes about the nature of this book and the  validity of its thesis.    What's even more striking and sad, is that Mr.  Jackson had the audacity to even quote the African Bishop of Hippo, St  Augustine, out of context to "prove" his thesis, "That which  is known as the Christian religion existed among the ancients, and never  did not exist; from the beginnning of the human race until the time when  Christ came in the flesh, at which time the true religion, which already  existed began to be called Christianity" (p. 1, Introduction, 85  edition).  Anyone who would but pick up a good Christian commentary, or  would read the words of Augustine himself in context, would know that the  good Bishop was speaking of how  passages like Gen. 3:15, in the long  undatable past, speaks of Christ in a prophetic sense.  Mr. Jackson  conveniently ignored this fact for the sake of "proving" his  thesis.  Mr. Jackson further argues, again using questionable sources,  that, "The whole Christian Bible was derived from the sacred books of  Egypt" (p. 115).  However, this idea is a non sequitur and post hoc  fallacy which assumes that if something follows something else, that which  followed MUST be derived.  That is not sound reasoning, and it also ignores  other important facts.  Primarily, if the "Christian Bible" is  derived from the "sacred Books of Egypt" (parts of which I have  read), then what explains the fact that the Egyptian books speak of male  AND female deities, while the alleged copy is uncompromisingly  monotheistic?   If the "Christian Bible" were a polytheistic  composition about male and female deities I could understand the point.   But the facts, once again, reveal otherwise.      Mr Jackson goes on in  his book to make overly simplistic and superficial comparisons between  Jesus and Baal and Adonis and Mithra, all the while ignoring recent  archaeology, science, and sociology which militate against his theories.   Whether its the unsubstantiated idea that  the Gospels are of "no  historical value" or other fantastic ideas which go against much  scholarly evidence (readers should see works by F.F. Bruce and Werner  Keller),  Mr. Jackson and the atheists perhaps should stop writing this  kind of material and go into writing fairy tales for children.  Reality  does not seem to be  their cup of tea.   And for those reviewers (like PTAH RA ANUBIS) who like to name-call instead of provide substantive evidence to support the idea that Mr. Jackson is a "well educated man," please try to remember that a) this is supposed to be a BOOK review, NOT a review of the book reviewer, and b) nothing you assert without proof will change the fact that those who think that Mr. Jackson's book has no flaws in either reasoning or scholarship probably are weak in those very areas themselves.  
 For those who have never read "new age" mystic like Deepak Chopra or L.Ron Hubbard, or views on the merging of the eastern mystics with christianity, this might seem like a new book. But to most SF (speculative fiction) fans, we've seen this done too many times.   It wouldn't turn a head at the Nebula Awards or even make it as a serial in Fantasy. It's been done so much better by people like Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov or Alfred Bester.  OK, what's wrong with it. Stop me if you've heard this one. Well the premise is from Fail Safe or maybe Dr. Strangelove. The out of control super-computer, with the mind of a maniacal would be world dictator. And the US military is out to blow it up before it can saturate the planet with nuclear explosions. But guess what? The computer is on to them...Oh My...Lions tigers and bears OH MY...we're not in Kansas any longer. (Where are the singing Munckins when you need them!)  Whose going to straighten all this out???? Well, Dr.Tennant, that's who...doh ti dah, dotid di dot ti dahhhhh...able to leap all religions in a single bound, more powerful that quantum mechanics...look up in the sky, it's SUPER DOC! or is it DOC the Christ, Jesus, this was ridiculous at some points.  There is a fine line between profound and unfounded, and Iles has done a great job of tripping over the line. I have read other Iles books, notably "24", and found them interesting and well written. But why do I think if this manuscript was submitted under a nom de plume, it would have been laughed at. Probably because it was past plausibility.  Characterization belongs in a cartoon...mean evil general who beats his daughter, daughter who grows up meaner than daddy, frightened Indian neurologist, stylish eccentric englishman, persevering psychiatrist (and jewish to boot), noble palestinians and mosad (israeli) agents. Our hero is more resolute than James Bond, tougher than Jackie Chan, a better shot than a trained sniper, able to survive on land, air and on the sea....oh and don't forget the crazy billionaire computer genius who wants to have himself downloaded into the mega-computer so that he can live for eternity.  One word, UGH. 
 This is by far the worst business book I have read in recent years.  It is hard to believe that Andy Grove actually thought that this material was worth putting into a book.  As other reviews have said, this book at most should have been a short article in Business Week...but even then it would require some actual content to make it worth reading.  The best part of the book is the quotes on the cover from Steve Jobs et al.  It makes me wonder if they even read the book 
 This is not up to par with his prior releases.  I did not care for his genre with this album.  I prefer his more bluesy music.  He has a greatvoice and is a fabulous musician, but this CD does not bring out either abilities.  It is a very average CD.  In fact, I cannot remember a single tune from it 20 minutes after listening to it.     I would like to see Jonny go back to the music that made him popular.  I don't believe that it would go against his new-found faith.  
 Foxwold (his review is above mine), gave no stars to this book but I give it one. Ultimately, I think Foxwold is right that the author doesn't appear to really be an enthusiast about the history of spices.   The book is not a comprehensive view of the subject by any means, but I would still enjoy the it as a whole had it mitigated against the normal 'dry' result of reference works by being an interesting read. Dalby doesn't manage to do this at all... The style of writing is not nicely flowing and the way in which the information is organized is sterile and uninteresting. I gave him one star because I learned a FEW interesting things while reading it but ... if I am not looking at an encyclopedia or a reference text, then I want my reading material to be stimulating too 
 After reading The Seducer, I decided to appease my curiosity about Julian and pick up The Romantic. I found him to be the most compelling character in The Seducer, despite saying very little.  In The Romantic, Julian lives up to that title. After years struggling with an unrequieted love for Penelope (our heroine) he must once again act as her guardian and protector.  Pen's in a horrible marriage and turns to Julian (once again) to help her escape her husband.   Like other reviewers, I thought Pen was a character that sort of grated on the nerves like a paper cut. She wasn't absolutely horrible, but she was awfully annoying. The number of times she makes bad decisions, relates Julian to a piece of furniture and plays the helpless victim are innumerable. One does begin to wonder what he sees in her.  The other problem I had with this book was similar to the problem I had with The Seducer and involves the "mystery" aspect of the story. The fact that Pen's husband is a sadist isn't really a secret, but the way Hunter resolves the problem of Pen's marriage to him (and the mystery that surrounds the resolution) is very reminiscent of "watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!"   I suppose it would have proven too problematic to resolve it any other way, and it did conveniently excuse the adulterous nature of Pen and Julian's relationship. I really had no problem with the adultery in this book, since Pen had been seperated from her husband for so long and no love was lost between them. I'm not sure why some readers would feel like they are mocking the sanctity of marriage (rather than Pen's husband, who abused her) but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing it's worth noting.  The writing held the same predictable yet still good character as in the other novel. The story held my attention and though Pen's character was not that well drawn, Julian's certainly was. He was compelling throughout the novel and I loved the convention of using his "letters" to various people. Actually, I wish more of these humorous asides had been included.  In summary, it's not really a stand-out novel, but if your favorite authors aren't supplying you with reading material fast enough, it's a good enough afternoon's diversion 
 I ordered this vacuum and was sent a "CleanFast" Model OC-910 that looks pretty much like this one.  I don't know if CleanFast bought Orca, but I expect the same product I ordered.  I haven't opened the box yet to try the vacuum because I'm considering returning it 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 The issue of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is a complicated and dramatic part of the history. From both sides, thousands of people died, milions became refugees as a result of the conflict. 20 % of Azerbaijanian lands were occupied by armenians. Fair enough, Azerbaijan blocked it's energy supply to Armenia.   The book fails to present these important facts, rather trying to concentrate reader's attention on the facts protecting armenian side only.  
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 I have a large interest in this subject, but the book was like a text book to me, instead of a story teller.  Could just be me. 
 Robert A. Heinleins novel "Starship Troopers" still creates controversy, generations after it was first published. Indeed, the well-known movie "Starship Troopers" was actually a veiled criticism of the book!   Is Heinlein's book racist or fascist? Is it a Cold War allegory? Is it anti-democratic and militarist? How does this novel square with Heinlein's reputation for being a libertarian and near-hippie? These questions are still being hotly debated.   "Starship Troopers" describe a future society in which only people who have served in the military enjoy full citizenship rights. Only honorably discharged soldiers have the right to vote and run for office. Strangely enough, the non-citizens enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of worship and the right to start businesses. Heinlein's future society thus looks like modern America, but with a Marine Corps-like military caste superimposed on top. In the novel, humanity wages a never-ending war against several races of intelligent space aliens, including the collectivist Arachnids, who resemble spiders. Many people take the Arachnids to be a symbol for Communism in general or Red China in particular. Imperial Japan is another possibility.   Heinlein's novel attempts to solve that ancient question: how can a society make sure that the best people serve in office? This question is particularly acute in democracies, where anyone can stand for office, and everyone can vote. Heinlein's solution is to limit the franchise to those who have served in the military. In this way, only the best are selected for the job. And those willing to put their lives on the line must be the best. But does that really solve the problem?   A military is not necessarily a good administrator or politician. The best in times of peace might be different from the best in times of war. Heinlein's system only works if a total and never-ending war is raging. Indeed, the war against the Arachnids certainly seem to be such. But if so, it's naive to expect freedom of speech or extensive rights for non-citizens. The system would become a military dictatorship pure and simple, like in the movie "Starship Troopers".   The soldiers in the novel are probably inspired by the philosopher-kings and Guardians of Plato's "Republic". After rigorous military training, the officers are given courses in moral philosophy, history and politics. But there are also similiarities with ancient Athenian democracy. Every citizen of ancient Athens was expected to serve in the army or navy. There was a connection between rights and duties. But note that many non-citizens in Athens were slaves!   Ultimately, "Starship Troopers" is unconvincing, even naive. You simply cannot give political power to the military, no matter how the military is recruited, and expect everything else to stay the same.  
 The Night Owl Optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as I started using it. The system uses high voltage derived from 2-AA bateries. Occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. If one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. I have returned the monocular to Night Owl for repairs. I do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. They told me to ship it at my expense. Another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours. Other than the above, the monocular has performed well. epilogue-Night Owl Optics did repair the unit and returned it. 
 There was enough redemption and entertainment in the first 2 books to have me reading the third, but what a way for Sinjun to go!  I liked Sinjun, I liked Colin, the Scottish adventure and running away from the overprotective brothers is great... So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex.  And later in the book when Sinjun decides to "let" her husband hurt her, it's DISGUSTING.  Having a man force sex on a woman is NOT romantic!  Rewrite the book to take out the rape and I would love it 
 I bought this over the Yakima equivalent for the locking accessory. What a mistake i made. The racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work. I called Thule to complain and was told i have a faulty unit and i need to RMA it. I sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case. But i would steer clear if i was you

 Noam has been around for quite some time and has a wide audience of follwers. Mr. Chomsky is highly critical of US foreign policy. He attacks both, the right and the left. The world is very complicate due to human nature not Noam Chomsky's political/linguistic analysis.  He has many adherents, especially from well known universities, including Berekley. But, Mr. Chomsky is marking his arguments in the form of speeches, books, dvds. Yes, the truth must come out. HE IS MAKING MONEY.......Lots of it!  People need to be more, not less, informed. And, they don't necessarily and should not be totally absorbed by Chomsky's politics. I find Chomsky's following, from two conflicting levels, humorous in nature and tunnel vision in nature. Humorous because people don't think for themselves. Tunnel vision because people don't think for themselves.  We humans have been in conflict from day one. We don't need Chomsky to remind us of this. Being an independent thinker is so important and critically rewarding; yet, many "scholars" make the same mistake: they look to others for validation. They almost cannot think for themselves.  America is a great nation. We should honor all that is good, question what is not, and support and strengthen this great nation 
 This book is neither a good book on selling over eBay not a good book on setting up a company. Trying to be "all things" to all people, it comes out as very superficial and almost anecdotal. Don't let the pagecount fool you: the 548 pages, with better layout (almost half of each page is white space) could be cut down to 200 or so, without much information being missed. And then, there's the dubious use of the information left. Having read the more technical "eBay Hacks" at the same time, though not focused on the business side of things, I found it to be a lot more useful. If you're looking to set up an eBay shop, go to eBay and read about it, and save yourself $17.47 in the process 
 "Execution" was as interesting as this one is useless. Don't buy. it is only blablabla! As always in movies, sequels are not as good as the original. However, I highly recommend their first book "Execution: the discipline of getting things done".  
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 I was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it.  It is very heavy and I am not a weakling!  It is also very big.  With my arm stretched out all the way I can barely get it to my head.  Because it is so heavy and big I have 'banged' myself on the head with the 'fingers'.  Just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer.  
 This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks. 
 This CD has three decent songs on it and that's pretty much all it has. Kut Klose didn't have a distinctive sound, so I knew that there wouldn't be a follow-up album. Most of the songs on "Surrender" are too slow and there's too much emphasis on sex.  "I Like" was the jam back in the day, but I'm sure that a lot of people have forgetten about the song as well as Kut Klose 
 I have read and re-read all three books on numerous occasions, hoping to find the hidden, deeper reasoning behind it.  In these readings, I eventually find myself skipping past the long diatribes of why this submission is so rewarding to some of them, and just reading the tawdry gay and lesbian sex. And yes, there is a LOT of spanking. If you are interested in learning about BDSM, stay away from these books, as they do no more than confuse the hell out of you.  I agree with the other reviewer, that I'm fairly certain this was not the socioeconomic trials of Medieval Europe. 
 My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work.  Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those "just in case" moments.  We plugged it in and have left it in since then.  Just this week our battery was dead again.  We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work.  We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start.  Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?  We haven't tried the outlet power, so I have no idea how reliable that is.  I won't count on this machine.  Luckily I have a small battery charger that I can plug my car into, and after twenty minutes or so I'm ready to go.  I won't be getting rid of that charger--it's much more dependable 
 I settled down for a nice read on what I expected to be a good, thoughtful expository writing on the sermon on the mount.  The book dove right in, beginning with the Beatitudes (great), but the waters seemed to be muddied by references to "metaphysics", "scientific Christian thinking", and focus on miraculous healing through some "special" prayer skills (I personally agree that God heals in response to prayer).  By page 30, with references to "reading rooms", I finally (duh) figured out that I was reading a book promoting the denomination and agenda of Christian Science.  I even skipped ahead to familiar but troublesome passages in the Sermon, looking for some insight from Fox.  I found nothing useful or especially insightful.  Now, of course Mr.Fox certainly has every right to publish what he wants, but I felt that his Christian Science message was in this case hidden in the Trojan Horse of a book on the Sermon on the Mount.  It seemed to not be the forthright way to present his position.  Fox is certainly on to something in refuting the dumb old western Christian religious systems, but still misses the mark in my calulation.  Theologcally, I belong to no denomination and am open-minded in the extreme, TO THE EXTENT, that propositions are within the bounds of the canon of Scripture.  I think that what I read in a few dozen pages of Fox does not nearly meet that test. 
 I love the concept of ironing this way, I just needed a machine that didn't leak out all of the water for steam all over the table 
 After waiting 2 months of the delivery I still have nothing.  There seems to be no way to contact Amazon about this.  Very poor service.  I recommend NOT ordering from them.  I'll have to arrange a charge back on the C 
 Read Andrea Makris' law suit at www.thesmokinggun.com all the dirty details are there, and should be required reading for anyone who reads O'Reilly or takes him seriously. He SETTLED the case after smearing her and threatening her, he's a little wimp and a coward and a "loofa" loving creep. Keep him away from your children! I Know the guy. from Washington  Jeff Gannon 
 I ordered my book. I moved. I contacted the seller, I contacted the seller, and again I contacted the seller. After three attempts, and after six weeks, the seller arranged a refund MINUS the shipping. Whose fault was this r-e-a-l-l-y......? I had no voice, and only get mass-mail answers in return. This seller is not good. I'd give them a zero if I could 
 There is a good reason why this book is going used for 93 cents. Don't waste even that. I can't believe I bought this book. 
 The recipes are all fine and good but they require a gigantic shopping list and cooking for 4.  Not realistic.  I have a 5 month old and have lost the weight but not with the help of this book.  Eat less exercise more but don't deprive yourself of anything 
 Begin looking this book over by reading Friedman's Introduction. Like all his books, its theme is rich-man as boogey man, great man as psychiatrically sick man. Friedman is a left wing academic. So are all the authors of the mediocre articles in the book.   The theme is secular progressive. The authors paint the rich man as boogey man, a new stereotypic mirage of America's great Philanthropists. Rich people are easy to stereotype because few Americans know any of them. The authors have academic careers based on reinterpreting great men as cardboard stick figures who merely foul the American terrain.  The weathly philanthropist is just out to get you, out to control your  mind. How do they have so much time for their boating & out of control consumerism? Whether he claims to give to improve lives, reduce suffering, or to give something back to the people, don't you believe it! Friedman & friends want you to know that they really are out to exploit and manipulate us all, after they are old and long gone. The good news is that most American academics are forgotten before they retire.   Never you mind the Ford family denouncement of the Ford Foundation, taken over by extreme neo-marxists (who take over charities and foundations in order to use them to give people--anarchy?) or the complaints of several families discussed in this book who object to secular progressive or neo-marxist take overs of thier great ancestor's philanthropic foundation. But "scholars" like Friedman and company - who really do know what Americans really want and what is best for us all - want you to know that the rich man really is out to get you.  Professor Friedman knows best. The late, great historian Professor Robert H. Bremmner dedicated a career to producing balanced histories of Philanthropists but Friedman and his first sargeant, McGarvie know better than Bremmner and his generation of real historians. Professor Bremmner was a gentleman and scholar and he is still remembered by many. He was not the simpleton Prof Friedman and friends depict him.  Read the reviews of Prof Friedman's first two books, especially "Inventors of the Promised Land". More political and psychoanalytical than historical, the books were roundly rejected as trash.   I wonder if they waited until Scholar Prof Bremmner and  his scholarly students passed away before they dared to publish this book that proves that there is no professional academic history today, just "fiction" disguised as history.   Look for the Friedman & McGarvie students to trash my review. Outstanding students of top historians pounced on Friedman for his many errors and wild interpertations. Now, his jump on anyone who criticises him. 
 Giving this so-called Bible a one is too high.  I love Scripture and have studied the Bible for years, but whenever someone quotes from this version, for me it is like listening to nails scratching a chalkboard.  It is THAT offensive.    The Message is frequently called a "translation" when in actuality it is a paraphrase with one man's interpretation as commentary.  I find that it actually obscures the plain and simple meaning of Scripture, and deliberately puts forth non-Biblical gobbledy-gook, while having the nerve and audacity to be referred to as "God's Word."  Distorting God's Word is a very serious matter, which The Message does all too frequently.  I have found that The Message frequently takes a Bible verse and makes it unrecognizable in form and in content from a good translation.       There are definitely places in The Message that come straight out of New Age dogma and verbiage, one notable example is in The Lord's Prayer.  This is extremely disturbing to me.    Just as no student of Scripture would ever dream of using The Living Bible for study, no student of Scripture should ever consider using this mess as representational of God's Word.  It isn't.  Please don't insult me with stuff like "kindergarten finger-painting" for Hebrews 6:1, or "blessed are they who, when they get to the end of their rope hang on" for a beatitude.  The Bible does NOT say or convey that meaning.             
 I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone as a first Kellerman's novel. There are too many medical jargons and terms as if Kellerman is trying to show off his medical knowledge. There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's "Demolition Angel" followed by Lee Child's "One Shot".  The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so. However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels "Murder Book" & "When the Bough Breaks" quite some time ago 
 As I read this book I got the feeling that it was a tabloid at worst and simply petty at best.  The author clearly has an agenda and is out to discredit the president.  I am saying this with no attachment to either party or to JFK whatsoever.  The book is basically about JFKs affairs, his supposed ties to the mafia, the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, and a few others.  It's basically a tearing down of JFK and his public persona.  I found it rather parochial frankly 
 This reclines is as advertised. It is comfortable and great to use.  UNTIL a pivot bolt self locking nut backs off and the sholder bolt seperates allowing the chair to come apart causing the frame to bend when you wind up on the floor. This is the bolt that you raise and lower yourself from reclined to sitting positions.  BTW this happenerd today 7/25 and the chair was ordered on 5/31  The threaded part of the bolt is not lonf enough for the self locking nut to do its job.  Today is Sept. 4th 2005 an update on my Lafuma experience.  Called two days ago to the Lafuma people asking where my repair parts are, boy did they play dumb. Said I never called about broken chair parts.   DO NOT buy this chair based on thier lousy customer service.  BTW they said this is a known problem with thire chairs, why then don't they correcxt it 
 Unfortunately, the book does not deliver what it promises. The author indicates a new method of interpreting the quatrains, i.e. the Green Language. As with most writers about Nostradamus, however, he spends a great deal of time with a posteriori predictions ("postdictions"). If he has truly found a new way of accurately interpreting the quatrains, then why is he not able to provide predictions? The author makes a lame argument that Nostradamus, himself, specifically wrote in a manner to make predictions impossible. Additionally, the author writes in the first person plural, which I found incredibly pompous and annoying. Save your money 
 The training plans in this book for "fit" (there are two sets of plans for each distance: "fit" vs. "unfit") are way too conservative.  I found myself using the Olympic distance plan to train for a Sprint distance triathlon.  There is no way following the "fit" Olympic distance plan I could have completed that distance.  It's suitable for training for a Sprint however but that's not what is intended by the author.  I also find it annoying that so much of the book is dedicated to these different flavors for both individuals and for teams.  It began to feel like me that the author was padding the book to make it longer.    Since most folks (like me) would buy a beginner book for the training plans I cannot recommend this book to a beginner to formulate a plan unless you feel like under-training and slogging through your first event. 
 I read a variety of self development books, most of which are very good.  This book however left me feeling like the authors were on a soapbox ranting about discipline. No inspiration or words of wisdom here.  
 Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.    In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.  There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature.   
 I am very pleased that we are getting back to the roots of religon > intolerance for ideas other than our own.  That is what this church was founded on right.  Jesus couldn't stand them "non-believers" and  Romans, so he told God, "Come and get me lord" And he did!   I  can't believe schools won't let this book in as a required textbook for  students.  I guess it must be them EVILutionists that are brain washing  people into thinking sinful thoughts.  I just pray everyone will someday  think just like us so the world will all be the same and we can finally get  some salvation around here.  It is my hope this book will help people  become more intolerant of others beliefs and wishes, just like the lord  wants it 
 Santa brought hello kitty this past christmas.  Hello Kitty is my daughter's favorite. It was going to be the best gift ever - instead it was her greatest disappointment. The mikes, music and lights were going to be amazing.  The one santa brought never worked so we contacted target and they sent a new one.  Well that worked maybe a day. We figured the drain on batteries was so great that it couldn't run for long so we bought an adapter - which it didn't come with (12.99).  Didn't help - doesn't work so now I have 2 broken hello kitty cd players and an adapter. We spent @$105.00. including batteries and adapter for this. 
 A big help to me in my game . The biggest help i got from another of rotellas books directly with putting and as a result i have never seen so many birdies in a round due directly to the said two books 
   This is a disappointing book. I had looked forward to what promised from some comments and reviews to be the first important book on the Kennedy assassination since Anthony Summers' Not In Our Time.  I am, readers will note, discounting numerous books since that publication which re-state old evidence, trying to give it some new twist, and conclude Oswald was the lone assassin.   The main merit of this book is that it does not accept the official story of the assassination. However, it attempts to prove a specific alternate theory, and it fails to do so. Along the way, it is pretty dull.   The first fault of this book is that it is poorly written - dull, heavy, and repetitive. The poor writing to which I refer is not just a matter of style. It includes, for example, many examples of saying, after suggesting some line of thought, that the authors will get to that in a later chapter. This is prima facie evidence of poor organization.  The poor writing includes such annoying faults as introducing facts or quotes with phrases like "as Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist said...." Haynes Johnson is introduced three or four times this way. Alert readers will recognize a technique to bolster a claim beyond its merit. In general, one expects such quoted information to stand on its own, not on the citation of a newspaper-marketing award.   The book descends into a almost silly hush-hush tone with a number of footnotes or parenthetical statements about how the authors are protecting the identities of certain people. After making such claims, the authors sometimes proceed to suggest who in fact is involved, the worst example of this being the suggestion that Che Guevara was the CIA's man in Cuba ready to kill Castro.   Another fault of the book is a truly enormous amount of quoted material. This is a lazy-minded practice, a substitute for good analysis. It is also simply padding used to create the kind of fat book many expect on a serious topic like this.  The book brings little that is genuinely new forward. Almost every idea in it has been suggested previously by others, including a number of books on the Mafia as assassins.   The idea that there was a secret C-Day plan (the authors' nickname for a coup and friendly invasion of Cuba being run in top secret by Robert Kennedy) only puts into new words what has been general understanding for years. President Kennedy was a jingo, as was his brother. He embraced the idea of American interference in the affairs of others. He was also part of a family that never accepted defeat with good grace. Neither of the Kennedy brothers would accept the embarrassing defeat of the Bay of Pigs nor the partial-defeat of the resolution to the Cuban missile crisis.   But the book's greatest fault is not proving its thesis. This book has a superficially plausible thesis, that the Mafia infiltrated secret Kennedy plans against Cuba and used the existence of these plans as cover for the assassination, knowing the government would be too embarrassed to reveal the truth afterward.  If indeed the Mafia were behind the Kennedy assassination, then it is doubtful there can be convincing direct evidence left, and indeed the authors fail to produce any. They assemble a complicated story from snippets of still partially-censored government documents and casual remarks. And as all people who have studied the assassination know, the most interesting government documents have never been released or do not exist.   Of course, the Mob doesn't leave filing cabinets full of paper documenting its crimes the way the Nazis did. The best we have had is whispered word that so-in-so said they killed Kennedy.   When you give the authors' thesis a second thought, you realize it is faulty from the start. Why would the government be intimidated about the revelation of its plot in the context of the early 1960s when almost anything anti-Castro was acceptable? Why would the government not go ahead with C-day after the assassination, just using the assassination as cover?    More generally, the CIA's dirty-operations people, armed camps of violent anti-Castro refugees, professional criminals, and other nasty hangers-on were all so tightly bound together in the costly, anti-Castro plots of the early 1960s, it seems inadequate to think of one of the elements, and the smallest element, as separate and influencing exclusively the course of events. Many anti-Castro Cubans themselves hated Kennedy, viewing him as weak in their cause. They didn't need the Mafia, having been generously financed and armed to the teeth by the CIA.    Al Qaeda's future training camps in the mountains of Afghanistan were small, under-financed efforts compared to these American operations involving thousands of people and tens of millions of dollars. It was a giant criminal, terrorist plot financed by government. It failed in its purpose, Castro outlasting two generations of American Presidents, but it managed to kill many people, waste huge amounts of money, and do a great deal of damage.   
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 should be the real title of this book - 
 The Good- This software completely locks down email access, internet access, network access etc.  The Bad - This software completely locks down email access, internet access, network access etc.    The UGLY.  I bought a new notebook I was going nuts trying to figure out why Outlook wouldn't send/receive emails, my wireless connection wouldn't work, why new software I was installing wouldn't update over the web, it was taking 5-10 minutes JUST TO RESTART THE COMPUTER!!! Hmmm all these issues started after installing Internet Security 2005.  To be fair I said ok, better make sure I have this set up right...So I took a step back, went to Symantec's site and spent time learning to properly configure the settings, software etc.  Ok great, my bad right?  Wrong.  When I tried adding Comcast's server addresses to the trusted list NIS 2005 would freeze up, I would have to reboot, and 10min later the same thing.   To make a long story short, I would not reccomend this product for anyone with less than 110% of patience and complete understanding of the product installation and set up.  The best thing about NIS 2005 was it only took 5 minutes to uninstall. 
 I was unsure about this company so I only popped for a week subscription, felt the gamble of $10 was worth it.  Well not all gambles work out, this one did not.  When you 1st register you tell them what vehicle you have, now one might think once you do this that the information you want to access will be about your particular vehicle, not so.  I want to know how to replace a certain part, well you go to that part look it up, it tells you the replacement procedure for a car not even yours, and nothing about your car, uh!! C'mon.   There's very little trobleshooting, no flow charts for troubleshooting. Save you money and buy a Haynes Manual for your vehicle, you'll be much farther ahead.   
 This product is not what it is cracked up to be.  I ordered it, and it doesn't really work too well, i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better.  There is not enough expansion room , its just like not really using anything at all.  Sorry, but i thought the product was not that good.  
 I really wanted to like this album, I really did. I love "Come Clean" and I was in anticipation of this, but when I got it I couldn't believe how bland and uncreative it was. It sounds like it was thrown together in ten minutes. The only reason i give it two stars is for the songs "Away From Me" and "Sydney" that's it. The rest of this CD is awful. This band can do much better than this. I am, however still a fan, I just the hope the next album (If there ever is one) shows me a little more 
 I liked the pace, flow ,and language of this novel. My problems stemmed from character behavior, having grown up in Texas I could not relate to these boys. I can not imagine any scenario where a groupsof teenage boys would get together to go have sex witha calf. I'm not naive to think this has never happened, it muight even happen on a regular basis, but not as a group activity with half the high school there to watch. Like ise there is no great homophobic group than teenage boys and for the author to say they made a habit of grabbing for each other's privates came across as unbelievable. Once I can't beleive a books characters, I no longer care about the story.   
 I recently bought this "Literary Classics" edition of "The  Diaries of Adam & Eve" expecting it to be the text of the  wonderful audiobook version of Twain's stories, as read by Betty Buckley  and Mandy Patinkin, only to find that it is not the same at all.  This  version is just a replica of the original books and does not include the  full text as heard on the audiobook.  Then I found the version I wanted,  subtitled "Translated by Mark Twain" and it, like the audiobook  version, is really something special.  To anyone interested in these  wonderful "first family" stories, I recommend searching for the  Fair Oaks Press edition 
 This book was... disappointing.  I expected much more from it.  For anyone with somewhat of s scientific background its not worth the money.  Everything I read was good and was well written but the depth that it went into was not adequate for anyone except the layperson 
 It's fine to be a believer; it's fine to be a skeptic. However, it is not fine to settle so staunchly on your viewpoint that all your conclusions are foregone--while representing to your readers that you undertake to proffer a balanced treatment. Nickell's treatment is in no wise balanced. One can say accurately of him, but generally of his entire organization (Committee for the 'Scientific' Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal) that they have no interest whatsoever in disclosing any facts that might tend to point to a less-than-mundane explanation for a mysterious phenomenon. Nickell claims to advocate the scientific method, yet, in his 'scientific' method, solid identification of a single piece of 'evidence' as a hoax is justification for immediately discarding however many thousands of pieces of evidence may be aligned with the hoaxed item. That is not the scientific method. Rather, in the scientific method, each collected fact or assertion must stand on its own merits, while the entire investigation--whether or not one is fond of the likely outcome--is to be steeped in balance, fairness, and open-mindedness, not in ridicule. "In science," wrote Dr. Mark Carlotto, "one viewpoint requires as much impeccable proof or disproof as another. Science does not tolerate taboos, ridicule, a priori judgments ..." Bravo, Dr. Carlotto, and boo, Mr. Nickell 
 I'm afraid it's a little hard to feel sympathy for a woman, however young, who enters into a relationship with a known womanizer - with a MLB star at that, whom are notorious for being less than faithful) - then sticks with him when she knows he's cheating on her from the start.  It's harder still to like a woman who then places the blame numerous times on the "poor parenting" and lack of values instilled by her parents.  The person I feel the most sympathy for is her mother, who may not have been a role model, but at least seemed to unconditionally love her children and tried to be supportive.  Was it really necessary for her to tell her family secrets?  While she may want a crack at fame and fortune, I'm afraid she's book-worthy for no reason other than being the ex-wife to a MLB player.    I give her credit for at least being honest in hindsight and taking her share of the blame in many of the situations, even when it makes her unsympathetic - and that makes her likeable.  I could better understand her situation had Jose Canseco changed after their relationship began - but it seems like he was an uncommunicative, selfish, arrogant person from the day they met, who never treated her well.  Jessica allowed herself to be bought by her attraction to him, his lifestyle and his fame - whether she ever really loved him isn't clear - but for all that, it got her nothing but unhappiness.    For all her harsh words regarding her parents, maybe one day she'll grow up and realize they're just people too - and everyone makes mistakes.  Doesn't seem to have stopped her from making her share of mistakes, as I consider her Playboy stint.  While she may have divorced Jose, she doesn't seem to have divorced herself of the idea of fame - and her use of his fame for her own means seems contradictatory of what she claims to have set out to do - free herself of him and move on to an independent life being a good parent to her daughter.  I don't mean to be harsh myself, but so far, a pretty face and body is what Jessica has traded on all her life and we all know that doesn't last forever.       
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 ... there's a strong made-for-TV vibe about this movie... 'nuff said 
 Almost everything about this movie is bad. On the writing side, there is no plot, no theme, no characterisation. It's like a first, very rough draft, that everyone involved convinced themselves was so brilliant it didn't need re-working. It's impossible to tell, for example, if the father is meant to be brilliant but fading, or just a rather stupid impostor. He constantly makes references to literary works he believes are valid, and he teaches creative writing, but none of his comments have any intrinsic value: it's just what he personally likes or dislikes. So we're left wondering if we're supposed to see him as a pathetic literary snob or the guy who's right. Quite possibly, this confusion is caused by the writer of this film being in a similar position.  Much of this film is like the 'Wonder Boys' without the charm, humour, humanity, surprise and interesting dialogue. It's a classic example of how up its own arse so much artsy film-making is. Plot faults abound, e.g. others have already pointed out the absurdity of an entire audience not having heard the Pink Floyd song plagiarised by the son.  As for the morality of making such a young actor do and say stuff he shouldn't have to . . . . In this country (UK), we have double-standards about this sort of thing, and it looks like the US may do too. For instance, here the press slaughtered, and continues to do so, Gary Glitter, a pop star who was found to have thousands of pictures of child porn on his computer. Rightly, his career ended overnight, and the press has continued to pursue him. Contrast that with Benjamin Britten, a classical composer. BB liked young, under-age, boys; he wooed them, took them on holidays with him and in one case at least, sexually abused a victim to the point of ruining his life. But his music is still played, his reputation intact. In fact, he's recently had a book written about him in which the writer 'explains' that his child-abusing was not really that at all, because in BB's day it was seen more as a companion/mentor kind of thing.   This film is a good example of how double standards apply, both morally and artistically, under the banner of 'art'. But the fact is, it's a boring, witless, unrealistic, morally suspect, piece of work whose only saving grace is that it's short. 
 i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here,so i was upset when i watched this sad movie. gary graham(t.v.'s alien nation) is a robot jox,which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought! the f/x are not very good and the story is paper thin,only the acting is good,but it can't save this one from being just a let down. skip it 
 Unfortunately I was EXTREMELY unhappy after listening to the album. Unlike many other Altan fans, I view Maireads singing as the weakest part of the groups appeal despite their having chosen some excellent songs over the course of their recording career. The problem is that on this album they emphasize her singing to the almost total exclusion of their  instrumentals which was what attracted me to the group in the first place. And the few instrumentals they do play are played with no spirit almost like "well I guess we have to put a few instrumentals on" kind of effort. I'm sorry, but she has a thin voice and is frequently shrill and off-key on many of their songs. She is however an excellent fiddler and that with the superb abilities of the other members and  inspired arrangements made them for me the top Irish folk group. Alas they have decided to stress her poor-to-mediocre vocals instead of their great abilities in playing reels, jigs, etc. I miss Frankie Kennedy's flute too. Goodbye Altan, your best day's are over unless you revert to the format of the old days 
 Alan Dershowitz' Rights from Wrongs, an original approach to the legal theory of human rights, is written in professor Dershowitz' familiar clear and articulate style, which makes it accessible even to non-legal scholars.  The book is an attempt to resolve a classic dilemma: are legal rights "natural", as suggested by the U.S. Declaration of Independence ("We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men...are endowed...with certain unalienable Rights")?  Or are they merely the outcome of humanly enacted legislation, in which case majority opinion overrides individual rights so that there are not really any "rights" per se?  Professor Dershowitz instead suggests that the human rights we should recognize come from observed experiences of injustice.  Traditional legal philosophy, using a deductive method of reasoning, takes as its starting point general principles relating to justice, the role of government, and a conception of society, and from there reasons towards rights that should be recognized.  Professor Dershowitz, on the other hand, applies inductive reasoning.  He considers human experience and, based on what he deems to be injustices, argues for the recognition of certain rights.  As an example, consider the case of organ transplants.  In the United States, human organs are typically not donated unless explicit consent has been provided by the donor.  In Europe, on the other hand, donation of human organs occurs unless a potential donor has explicitly denied his or her consent.  The outcome is that in the United States there is a scarcity of organs, and comparatively speaking more people die from a lack of organs than do in Europe.  Thus, professor Dershowitz argues that there should be no presumptive right to take one's organs to the grave.  Instead, the presumptive right should be that of receiving an organ transplant if medically required.  While this example may appear quite reasonable (utilitarian arguments often do), the flaw in professor Dershowitz' inductive methodology becomes apparent once it is applied to cases involving economic scarcity, where conflicting interests inherently lead to dispute.  The point of professor Dershowitz' methodology is to use experience rather than abstract, general principles to help settle such dispute.  But when parties to a concrete, specific conflict argue for certain rights, they will be inherently biased by their stake in the outcome of the conflict.  And rights are supposed to reflect justice, not interests.  Thus, professor Dershowitz' approach is not sufficient to settle such dispute.  It appears we really do need general principles.  The source of such principles, however articulated, should be the values of the members of a community.  To be sure, there is no universal agreement on values, especially when they conflict--e.g. in the classic debate between liberty and equality--but debate at the level of abstract, general principles will be far less biased than at the level of specific, concrete cases.  Professor Dershowitz also fails to make a distinction between so-called positive and negative rights.  Negative rights are essentially the common-law system of individual rights and duties, such as the right to not be murdered, the right to not have one's property stolen, the right to not be enslaved.  It is generally not an issue of debate that the first role of government is the enforcement of these rights.  In contrast to negative rights are positive rights (also known as welfare rights), such as the right to basic provisions in life including food, clothing, shelter, a job, or, say, universal health insurance coverage.  The main problem with positive rights is that a right for one person implies an obligation for another.  We may say "a chicken in every pot," but saying so does not make it so: the chicken will have to be provided by someone.  Such mirror obligations are utterly reasonable in the case of negative rights, which mean that I have an obligation to not murder you, or to not steal from you or enslave you.  But this is different with positive rights: just because I may think I have a right to food or to a job (a right that is presumably based on my need for such things), it does not follow that you therefore have an obligation to feed me or to employ me.  You may wish to help me, for example by means of private charity, but my need does not constitute your legal obligation.  Thus, positive rights are essentially meaningless.  And no legal theory about rights that fails to make this distinction, or that fails to reject the legitimacy of positive rights, can be considered a valid approach to the theory of rights. 
 I think the girl can sing but comparing her to Whitney, Mariah, and Celine is a bit too premature.  She's just yet another imitator of the aforementioned ladies.  I don't find her particularly soulful.  She thinks she can be the best by oversinging and screeching.    Another thing.  I am sick of her and her fans's attitude towards Beyonce.  I am not a fan of Beyonce either but Christina and her fans are just pure haters.  Beyonce does sing better IMO.  Her tones are better than "Xtina's" who tries to sing beyond her limits 
 When I ordered this book, I expected a tongue-in-cheek retrospective of the ups and downs of being the parent of a gifted child.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Very wrong.  This book is no more than a regurgitated  compilation of common lists found at every gifted site on the internet.   Any parent who has come this far looking for information on parenting their  gifted child has already seen every characteristic list in this book at  least two or three times for free.  Do not waste your money on this book 
 Having read all of the Savitch and Sherlock series I was truly looking forward to this book.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the revenge and murder plotline as well as the poorly drawn characters.  If you are a first time reader of Cathering Coulter, I would advise you to read the early Savitch/Sherlock books such as "The Maze", "The Edge" and "The Target".  They are exciting, well plotted stories that are well worth the time you will invest reading them 
 I was disappointed with this book.  The events described are an almost an hour by hour passage of time, during the short lives of these two antagonists. We really don't care what Clyde did at 2am on the morning of the 15th of the month if it really has nothing to do with the outcome of the event!  It seems as if this author wrote these pages directly from a courtroom transcript or a witness' testimony. Furthermore, there are entirely too few pictures (we want to see more of Bonnie & Clyde - duh!!).  Pass on this book and buy one of the others out there.  
 This book is not your standard narrative history, but rather a collection of essays by leading 16th century English historians. There is an attempt to give equal space to Ireland and Scotland in addition to England. While generally admirable, this leads to a rather disconnected history, with many abrupt switches back and forth from England to Ireland to Scotland. The organization of the book into sections on Economy, Politics, Religion, Political theory, Arts, and Foreign relations is rather awkward and leads to an unnecessarily fragmented account. The writing is generally quite dry and dense, as the author is required to cover an entire century of history in one short essay. John Guy's essay on Political theory during the period, however, is quite interesting, covering an aspect of 16th century history usually ignored in general histories. There are much better histories of the period available, notably NEW WORLDS, LOST WORLDS: THE RULE OF THE TUDORS, 1485-1603 by Susan Brigden 
 We did not receive this item.  We would rather not rate this item since it was never received...  We consider it a zero star not even 1 star 
 I have to start with the fact that this is, in fact, an outstanding story and concept. The idea and plot are solid and the characters interesting. However that is where the book falls apart. The Story is great but the writing is atrocious. I have seen better writing from kids in the 6'th grade. Either Mr. Swanwick is off his A.D.D. medication or he needs to get on some, and FAST!. The storyline jumps around frantically, there is virtually NO character development short of the main two and even they are pathetically "explained". The "species" and "Classes" are left to be assumed as to their place in the world woven for us. Unless you are a fantasy "buff" you would never understand 3/4 of the phrases used. The mix of lower level writing interwoven with PHD level words and explanations of scientific theories interwoven with magical power is beyond mind bending when you try to shift gears between S.A.T. words and ideas of scientific theory and fantasy troll vs troll with arms getting ripped off as insane porographic sex with some pedophile overtones is occuring right next to it.   My review is hard enough to follow, the book is 5 times worse. I will never disgrace my expansive library with a book of this authors again.  
 This book is still filled with wrong answers in its chapter tests. An example of this can be found in a question in chapter 1 that doesn't even get covered until chapter 2. I expect so much better from Sybex!!! 
 Maybe OK for around house but barely works 1/2 mile from radio to radio. OK for around the house but we have trees and whatever else seems to block the transmission. We live in central Mississippi. I understand their test for 10 miles is in the desert where it is flat. No rolling terrain which doesn't roll that much in Mississippi 
 the  original   book  was  great I purchased it many years  ago but  this   book   was  a poor  zerox  copy   of  the original  and  some  of  the type  could  not  be  read  to  the extent it   was  not  worth keeping  so I sent  it  bac 
 What a world we live in where propaganda is no longer used to support governnments but corporations. After 30 minutes of this tripe I felt ill. Any serious person with an understanding of democracy and modern business practice will reject this heavy handed corporate propaganda 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 I bought and read this book and found it to be a superficial treatment of the subject for Christians who believe in a single God, which I am not.  I finished the book hoping for a deeper understanding of guilt and forgiveness after experiencing the recent suicide of my only child, a seventeen year old boy suffering from severe depression.  I am sure this book will be comforting for those it is written for but it did not shed any light on the subject for me 
 Because of the award nomination and short-story format, I bought this book.  I found it boring, honestly.  I thought this might be the case because I'm a man and this is about women (though that's not stopped me enjoying books by Amy Tan, Joyce Carol Oates, Jhumpa Lahiri, or Sandra Cisneros but I was thinking there I must be reading something wrong).  However, I felt vaildated when my mother - an avid reader - read it and complained about the pace and characters as well.  Fortunately, it's a short read so it wasn't a long waste of time 
 Everyone's idea of erotica is different.  Now that that is out of the way, this book sucked.  Sure there was a couple of good stories but 99% was hot if you are an 80 yr old person.  Erotica should get someone hot and rearing to go.  This had me ready to go to bed, and sleep the rest of the night. B_O_R_I_N_G sums up this LAME book 
 Does not work with Verizon V3C. When I plug the phone in, it says "Unauthorized Charger" and refuses to charge at all. It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a "charger." I give it one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars. If I could, I would give it ZERO stars. I suppose that would be bad for business, but it is what it is. Avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing. Maybe it works in China, but not in North America 
 Very disturbing --on serveral counts.  i had high hopes for Stephan flash back for someone 2000 years old of his life,relationships with other women in his life and most of all understanding his feelings towards Beatrix. i had a hard time following the story line due to the sexual exotic scenes with him and the Daughters. i really did not understand the purpose of it all in holding himself in.  i love Stephan and my heart went out to him because there was so much guilt within himself, feeling bad about Asharti and mostly the fact that Beatrix left him.  i wanted to cried through it all because i guess the love i wanted for him he could not have and if if he express his love towards Beatrix his idealist ideas held him back 
 Tobin's book is to be read now after the market collapse.  Stuffed with made up terms "GOD and EGOD" for example,(GOD) standing for Game Over Dominators, the book is organized in a logical way but the stock picking method doesn't make any sense unlike Peter Lynch's seminal 1989 book, One Up on Wall Street.  Let's not forget that Lynch had the billion $ Fidelity Magellan to manage. Smith only had the Journal and may be tons of other reference materials to make up for inexperience.  Anyway his next book should be called "Tsunami&quot 
 Has everyone gone insane?  As an English teacher who has taught this novel for a couple years, I was looking for a little something more faithful to the novel than the original version. Hah!  This piece of trash is the worst version of a classic novel I've seen in 20 years of teaching. There were approximately three moments in the movie that actually had to do with the text, and I'm sure that was purely accidental. The monster is a gangster, Frankenstein looks like one of the Spartans in The 300, Elizabeth is a deranged emo, and Clerval has been relegated to to role of idiotic womanizer. When the credits rolled at the end and I saw that Branagh had directed this film (he who created the most watchable, beautiful, and textually accurate version of Hamlet ever), I thought I may as well burn myself on a funeral pyre (one of the few textually accurate details in this horror of a film).  Here's the deal - don't waste your time. Read the book. Byron and Shelley were right - Mary had somehting going with this story - too bad Branagh forgot to read it 
 "A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish. Not just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean."  This is a book I have some trouble with.  It is beautifully illustrated, and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children. However, I am not entirely sure it is sending the right message. I like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well, that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy.   But ultimately the solution to the Rainbow fish's problems give unclear messages, and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them.  Other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness 
 This shoe is extrememly uncomfortable!!  The straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail.  I won't ever wear them again 
 Why is this? Why are Arabic instruction books sooooo atrocious? There is sufficient demand for Arabic now and sufficient research in language education to come up with something better. What a sad testament that Al Kitaab is actually the standard in university-level Arabic instruction! It makes me want to rip my hair out. Somebody, anybody, PLEASE publish a decent Arabic instruction text. And, for all you publishers out there doing colloquial Arabic: EGYPTIAN!!  A third of all Arabs are Egyptian and it's the only dialect universally understood by other Arabs. So please quit with all the Lebanese, Saudi, Iraqi, Jordnaian colluquial courses until there is a decent Egyptian course available 
 These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair. 
 Mark Levin's book falls into some of the usual pitfalls that almost all biased political argumentation today falls into--evidence is often stretched and recontextualized to fit certain predisposed conclusions.  The book is clearly well researched, and Levin is no doubt quite knowledgeable about legal process and the language of the US Constitution, but his conclusions are often stretched to a degree that no longer fits the evidence.  I would hesitate comparing his method to a smokescreen, for I am not entirely sure if Levin is purposefully making exaggerated claims that he doesn't support but artfully disguises in the ethos of research, but at the core of many of his ideas are assumptions or basic contradictions that he just can't back up.  For example, Levin is trying to show with this book that there is a long-term conspiracy of liberalism that has been slowly forging opportunities for itself in the process of applying the Constitution to the cases before it so that there would be precedent to back what Levin calls unConstitutional decisions like in Roe vs. Wade.  Levin pushes a good case to look further (personally) into the basis of that and other decisions and if they do have Constitutional basis, but Levin instead goes into a history lesson of the decisions that predicated decisions like Roe vs. Wade with the assumption that every opportunity opened in previous decisions regarding things like the right to privacy was in fact the doing of a long-term liberal plan to open the doors of power for an activist court.  Certainly, legal cases are often made on the grounds of precedent, but instead of revealing the focus on precedent rather than the Constitution as a problem in the deliberations of the Supreme Court, Levin tries to turn the problem into an unsupportable conspiracy that comes across on the edge of paranoia rather than sound, unbiased reason.  And when Levin starts out the book stating that the justices should be treated as humans rather than gods, he wants to convey the idea that their actions may be questioned, but will not acknowledge himself that the history of precedents may also be the mistakes of the same human beings whom he does not want us to deify.  Levin also breaks his guise of the the reasonable viewer of history when he tries to establish the intents of the founding fathers, equating Jefferson's participation in prayer services at Congress as a direct negation of his over-used mention of the wall of separation.  Clearly, Levin cannot see no possible correlation between the two, and thus the questioning of the validity of prayer in schools must be a moot argument.  Just to make sure that his bias is clear, he throws in a little slippery scare tactic of suggesting a future where religious observance is also banned in the home.  Levin makes the same kind of rhetorical blunders when he suggests that Blackmun may have turned 'left' under the influence of his wife (while giving a little shot in the arm to Richard Nixon for having the foresight of wanting to base a Supreme Court nomination partly on the quality of a man's wife).  When discussing the famous argument over the inclusion of "under God" in the pledge of allegiance, Levin focuses more on how much the plaintiff's daughter actually wanted to say the phrase, which is of course moot when considering the actual legitimacy of requiring the phrase in a patriotic statement.  In the end, this book comes across as yet another argument of bias in what has clearly become a divisive popular culture--evidently, a book isn't commercially viable unless it has a line to hold, no matter which side. 
 except for Ray of Light, which is one of the best pop songs of 90s, the Power of Goodbye, Beautiful Stranger and Deeper and Deeper. Where are the remixes of Don't Cry for me Argentina, or You Must Love Me or the remake of American Pie? The half of the album is full of silly ballads and R&B-scented numbers like the rubbish It's Human Nature, the sleep-inducing (but mean to be a good ballad) Take A Bow which is the same with all Babyface songs, Bedtime Story which is the same as ever with anything Bjork has done in the past and so-so Secret. Frozen seems to be a nice standout but it doesn't feel sincere, and more or less sounds like Power of Goodbye... and the Music album was one of the worst albums Madonna crapped out so singles should not be different.  All in all, Madonna is not a slow number singer; her voice terribly sounds weaker than her dance numbers and that's why this greatest hits album was not successful as Immaculate Collection because the singles were already bad. This album reflects the spiral-down of Madonna through 90s to 2000s (except Ray of Light where she struck gold) where she hit the bottom with American Life and has not recovered herself. Go buy Immaculate Collection, Ray of Light album, down load one or two other songs at your disposal and you will have the good things Madonna has produced among the heap of redundant mass called pop music. 
 This book is not about love, it's about the worst side of human nature.  I wrote a review that was censored by Amazon because I listed the disgusting human behavior carried out in this book.     It's horrifying that we are censored if we list the things that happen in a book that Amazon is happy to sell to you.  So, heads up, maybe a lot of people who didn't like it are being censored.  I wouldn't trust the reviews. The people in the book have no heart or affection for one another.  Granted we all may have different definitions of love, but Morrison's is totally awful (quit reading if you don't want info on the end of the book):  two women who were friends until age 11 spend the rest of their lives hating each other.  As old women, one is fatally injured trying to hurt the other at which point they realize they loved each other all along.  Yeah, I guess Morrison can call that love but it's a pretty sick idea of love if you ask me.  Morrison is a good writer but the characters are really obnoxious people - she should be ashamed for writing such a cold, mean-spirited novel when she has such talent 
 As someone who is very interested in oil and it's effects on the global economy, I looked forward to reading this book with great interest.   The Leebs go through a cursory analysis of the state of the current oil supply.  The question of when we will reach peak oil production is open to great debate with estimates varying widely depending on who is asked.  The Leebs assume that we will arrive at our peak oil consumption in this decade and predict $100/barrel oil by 2010.    They may be right, they may be wrong.  I am not troubled by their prediction of $100 oil; however, their conclusion that $100+ oil will cause hyperinflation is stated as fact with no real evidence to substantiate their belief.  In fact, many economists will argue that rapidly increasing oil prices could be deflationary or only marginally inflationary.  The Leebs assume that the oil embargo of the 1970s and the resulting inflationary spiral that occurred in the U.S. will occurr again as oil prices march steadily higher.  This logic is flawed for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that a steady, measured rise in prices allows time for the global economy to adapt to higher oil prices in ways that a sudden oil shock does not.    Furthermore, some economists argue that higher oil prices could be deflationary.  The Leebs ignore the fact that we are living in a globalized and highly competitive environment that is very different from the world of the late 70s.  If companies are having greater difficulty passing along higher energy costs to consumers; profit margins will contract, investment in R&D and new manufacturing capacity will slow, job groth will stagnate, and deflation will be as great, if not more of a threat, than inflation.  When manufactures are able to pass higher energy prices to consumers, the higher costs will tend to suppress demand thereby limiting economic and wage growth.    Personally, I think they got it wrong.  The Leebs do not support their basic premise that higher oil prices will lead to inflation; they accept it as received wisdom.  For this reason, everything that flows from their assumption of hyperinflation is flawed.  
 "South By Java Head" is the kind of book you might enjoy more if you just had a bitter breakup with your Japanese girlfriend.  The Japanese are the villains, of course, it being World War II and the protagonists a group of mixed civilians and English military personnel escaping Singapore a half-step ahead of Tojo's Army, but this 1958 effort by Alistair MacLean was written well before the advent of political correctness, and its racism is not only troubling but actually a detriment to the thin story.  Meet the lead villain, Col. Kiseki. As described by a Javanese villager, "Colonel Kiseki is not human. He is an animal, a jungle animal. But the jungle animals kill only when they have to. Kiseki would tear the arm off a man - or a little child - as a thoughtless child would pull the wings off a fly."  Later, we meet one of Col. Kiseki's grinning underlings, who assures us his prisoners will be tortured before they are killed because "the strong have no need" of international conventions. Special treatment will be dished out to the female nurses, he adds.  Yes, the Japanese often employed cruel tactics in World War II, but here instead of merely allowing them to be villains with the appropriate degree of intelligence and menace, MacLean turns them into savage brutes so bent on cruelty and killing that it literally causes their defeat. Meanwhile, the protagonists whose story we doggedly follow from one mess to the next seem done in or saved by odd spells of luck, both bad and good, rather than their own devises, about which little is clear in this convoluted narrative.  I only docked the book one star for racism; it's otherwise terrible enough. MacLean served up many cardboard characters and cheap plot twists in his career, but here, in only his third novel, and following the two classics "H.M.S. Ulysses" and "The Guns Of Navarone," he seems to be serving up a foretaste of his worst writing to come.  It's a shame because MacLean's plot idea is unique, a refugee ship trying to make safe landfall, and the opening chapter describing Singapore under siege just hours before the Japanese takeover is a good example of MacLean at his descriptive, Conradian best. But it all falls to pieces quickly as MacLean loads up his story with secret documents, double agents, traitors, and bad romantic subplots, not to mention so much pain and anguish as the party comes under repeated attack from the Japanese and the elements that you almost wish they would just capsize their craft and be done with it.  I love reading MacLean books, even the rockier later ones, because of his craft and his wit. But this was a painful read for me on many counts, and the hardest of his books to get through. Unless you're a completist (like me), give it a miss 
 This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion.  The character development was weak.  The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention.  If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first.  I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series. 
 The first two reviewers did a great job of describing the storyline, so I won't go there.  I'll tackle the ending...WHAT ENDING?  I even backed it up to see what I missed. THEN, I went to the special features to see an alternate ending.  It varied little from the shows ending. After investing the time to see this movie, I hated the ending. However, Jacqueline Bisset is still very lovely. Adam Garcia didn't too badly and I did like the sounndtrack so there were a few saving graces... 
 This book is not an introduction to DirectX, D3D, or C#. It is a very high-level introduction to game engine design. One could almost gain as much from saying "Compartmentalise your objects" several times a day.  The title implies that it will give you some help understanding how DirextX and C# work together to create a game engine. This is false. There is a lot of uncommented code in this book (half the first chapter of 26 pages is uncommented code). The explanations given are abstract to the point of being worthless to someone who truly needs an introduction, giving only light glances at the example code. It is impossible to get a clear picture of everything involved.  There are doubtless those for whom this book is the perfect level of abstract discussion. However, I believe this is the exception rather than the rule. Highly not recommended 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff 
 It took so long I had forgotten I had ordered it and almost bought it at a book store! Beyond that, the cover was horribly bent and torn, it was yellow, the spine was nearly shattered from use, and it wasnt even the same edition I ordered! Ugh 
 I only had it for a few hours and after that I knew I would be returning it. Its video quality is quite horrible, just better than a videophone and average of a webcam. I should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive. But honestly, I prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is. It's quality will not be any better unless your outside, and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun, this would not do. You basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow. This also is a pain for Mac users. It says it's able to import files, and yes it can, but in ASF format. Now you can play it in VLC, but think you'll be able to convert it, think again. It converts just fine, except without audio. I've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio. So, Mac users, pick something else. It is being returned, for certain 
 This book is a total joke designed to make money and provide NO useable information. The title makes you think there is salvation to losing weight and that is not the case. Just a gimmick to fleese money from fat people.  
 I installed this on my laptop and it slowed it down to a crawl.  I deinstalled it , installed Norton 2005, bought the subscription Renewal and my laptop is back up to speed.   You have been warne 
 I spent 30 years as a so-called "born again" evangelical fundamentalist, and at first bought into everyting Dobson teaches in this book.  However, it was producing just the opposite of the kind of child I wanted my child to be. I wrote to Dr. Dobson and told him that I think children should have the right to make more of their own decisions and that we as their parents should be there as a guide and should not be punishing them for every little thing they do. I thought, and still do think, that childhood is a time to make mistakes, that's how we learn. And that not all childish behavior IS a mistake. I think kids are thoughtful and intelligent and able to consider the alternatives and decide for themselves what's right and wrong, if given the opportunity. I told Dr. Dobson that I unschool, which means that I allow my children to educate themselves at their own pace, studying whatever is exciting to them, and at the time and place of their choosing. I do not force them to study or learn. I do not force them to adopt one religious belief over another. I do not adopt a certain set of behaviors that are considered "acceptable." He wrote me back and said that children will not choose to learn reading or math unless we make them, and that children will not make the right choices when given freedom. HA! My kids are now 15 and 20, and for several years they read when they wanted and played video games when they wanted, and if they didn't want to study they didn't, but now they are completing high school by correspondence and they are doing great! They chose to study and get the diploma all on their own, and they are bright and inquisitive and we STOPPED spanking and punishment of any kind and did everything just the OPPOSITE of what Dobson says, and we are very please with our kids development. I now work in a social services setting teaching parents who've had their kids removed from the home how to parent appropriately, and I can tell you, the worst behaved kids are the ones who have had a life of punishment to try and get them to conform to somebody's idea of how they should behave. I teach my parents how to engender their kids cooperation without any kind of punishments or rewards, just through mutual respect. Believe me, if you have a strong-willed child, count your blessings. It's these kids who will think for themselves and not allow themselves to be doormats or brainwashed so they conform to society's demands. They will, if you let them, turn into wonderful people who will choose what they want out of life instead of having everything dictated to them.  This book shows you how to make sure your kids know who's the "boss". If you approach your kids this way, you will get one of two things:  rebellion, or kids who don't think for themselves. By the way, I no longer am an evangelical fundamentalist, and disavow and relationship with that movement, though I believe in God.  Religions are manmade, as is this approach to childrearing 
 I am impressed my the large selection of music on the disk, but I am very disappointed by the shortness of every piece.  Most of these are around 90-120 seconds each, at the longest.  Several are only 30 seconds long.  You are still deciding if you like the tunes when they end.  If you are looking for a catalog of the music from the Revolutionary War, this is a great overview of tunes.  But you will not be satisfied with the performances, owing to there brevity.  Not the musicians fault, they perform wonderfully 
 First off what is garbage?  Something you use for about two hours and then toss it in the trash can.  So is there a difference between garbage and trash. Yes..............trash lasts longer before you toss it in the can.  Good thing Common exposed this [....]  But hey, at least he has one good thing going for him by snatching up the sexy T-Boz from TLC but that is ALL hehas going for him. Put it like this .....A three year old could make a better album.  Stay Away...............Far Away 
 First of all, you need to understand the patterns in the gang of four book before you attempt to read this one.  They talk about them all over the place without explaining them.  That's a warning, it didn't affect my review.  The major thing I don't like about this book is the abstractness with which they talk.  They give you a high level description of a pattern and leave you with that fogginess.    I think the examples were poorly chosen.  I would have prefered to have examples that are only as complicated as they needed to be.  Unfortunately the book uses examples like, "We're going to make a voice recognition application" or "We're going to make an OS that can run applications that were built on Unix or WinNT or Linux".  I think the intent was to have some real-world-I've-been-working-for-six-years examples... it would have been smarter to put the real world examples in a separate chapter and keep the design pattern explanations simple.  Also, I hate the diagrams.  They should have just copied the diagrams in the GoF book!  Instead they chose these diagrams that give less info and IMO are downright ambiguous in some situations.  Another thing the GoF book does is have 2 separate diagrams, one that's a (simple) real world example and another that's a diagram of the actual pattern.  This book only has the diagram of the actual pattern.  I disagree with those that say this book is better than the GoF book.  I think what they like is the material covered.  Material aside, the GoF book presents the information in a much clearer way.  That's why I prefer the GoF book over this one 
 This is not a great book - pure and simple.  The author is chaotic in his exposition of the subject and time after time tries to come up with his own reinterpretation of the key concepts of Buddhism - apparently, in an attempt to look original.  Not recommended.  
 I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.   The setting is the same as the first book, an alternate mid-1980s England in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation. Fresh off the events of "The Eyre Affair", Thursday Next (a police officer specializing in literature related crimes, such as first-edition forgeries, valuable manuscript thefts, and the like) is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre (and changed the ending for the better), when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband Landen. Unfortunately, the evil Goliath Corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the Chronogaurd (timestream police) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage. In the first book Thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside Poe's "The Raven", and it seems they want him back.   This a potentially interesting plot, but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things Fforde throws into the mix. Most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday (and are also linked to events in the first book). Another plotline concerns the discovery of a "lost" Shakespeare play, which looks to be the most important literary event of the century, if Thursday can authenticate it. There's also the small matter of Thursday's pregnancy. And just when one is comfortable with Thursday's role as a "SpecOps Litratech", and that whole milieu, she's thrown into an entirely new one as a member of "Jurisfiction", a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in different literary works and maintain order... Finally, her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone wrong and the entire world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a few days unless he can figure it out, and can she help him. Phew!  I've probably missed one or two elements, but you get the idea. Fforde is just brimming with nifty ideas, but the shame of it is that he can't stop and give any of them the attention they deserve. It's impossible to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he's just going to move on to something else in a few pages, and it's impossible to care about the characters when their existence is utterly malleable, as is time and place. I suppose it's all meant to be puckish good fun, but the overall effect is more an attention deficit disorder Nancy Drew heroine meets a poor-man's Douglas Adams. The book has its occasional moments, but the humor is far too broad and unsubtle, and there's absolutely no narrative tension. All the literary in jokes in the world can't save this shambling wreck, and I don't think I'll be moving on to the next book. 
 My 9-yr old received this toy as a birthday present. Of course it looks COOL.  Against my better judgement of immediately returning it, we opened, played for 10 mins, got frustrated, and will now return it.  The boys were VERY patient adusting the straps properly to their bodies (it took 20 mins).  Seems like good quality wiring - I was afraid they'd pull at it while strapping in, but it didn't.  Must stand 10 feet away from each other (a good thing!).  The punch/block sounds are cool, but the boys got very confused trying to figure out who scored, what the lights on chestplate meant, etc.  It's possible that you must go slow and perhaps wait for 1 player to throw punch.  Then block.  Difficult for excited boys to be so choreographed and patient!  Block with opposite hand of partner's throwing punch hand WHILE squeezing a button on palm strap of your other hand.  There's some maneuvering to get used to.  But within 10 minutes, all sound/power went down, and we couldn't get it to recharge/work again.  It's supposed to recharge quickly so I don't know what the problem is.  Instructions say when nothing happens, change batteries...but 10 mins into game?   Hmmm.  Too frustrating for all the effort 
 but not to read! :-) Simply unbelievable that Matt Dalton would feel he could write anything about the Peterson case worth reading! It rates right up there with something that Falconer (original juror #5) might pen! Some of these reviews certainly remind me just how gullible peeps can be. I'm glad I wasted no money on this borrowed drivel - just wasted the time it took to read it! I rated it with 1 star simply because that's the lowest choice here. In reality it's less than zero 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 If David Simon's personal values and political orientation are crucial to your life, don't miss this book by any means.  If you aren't aware of what his personal values and politics are, just watch the editorial columns of your local newspaper for 3 or 4 days, focusing on the writers of whom you've never heard or cared.  If you don't want to spend even that much time, I'll mention that Simon appears fascinated by redistributionist cant and utopian (read as impractical and impossible) social democracy.  He doesn't care much for any of the national administrations in recent years, including that of the Clintons and seems to wish we'd have something along the lines of a French or German polity of the last half dozen years.  None of that is illegal, although I tend to think that the concepts are foolish and impractical.  What did offend me (more than my lost $15 or 20 purchase price) was the shameless appropriation of David Chase's and James Gandolfini's work to sell social and political ideas that are barely relevant to it, if at all.  If you don't know or care who David Simon is or what his personal critiques of America are (and he ain't Tocqueville by a long shot) save your money and effort and avoid this dime a dozen rant 
 This book was such garbage.  I was so disappointed because I was looking for a good ole horror, hair-on-the-back-of-my-neck-standing-up book - and this wasn't it.  I'm just glad I bought it in paperback.  I did read the whole thing, thinking that somewhere along the line it might redeem itself, but it didn't.  So when I finally turned the last page, I got up and to the confusion of my teen-aged daughter, I threw the book in the garbage and when she asked, "Why did you throw that book in the garbage?", I said, "because that's where it belongs".  
 This book should be taken out of print.  If you have worked as a professional painter for six months to a year you could write a better book than this.  Horrible pictures and almost everything is completely out of date including estimating data, product information, and design and color recommendations. You would be better off buying an up to date book on running a general contracting business and asking a very knowledgable paint rep. on what products to use for specific situations 
 I've been confused by Michael Medved's position on film ever sinse he posed a question in the wall Street Journal asking "What happened to the missing moviegoers?".  He was speaking about the end of the Production Code (censorship) in Hollywood, and how that coincided with a drop off in movie attendance.    Yes--movies seriously changed in the late 60s, as filmmakers were allowed to depict subject matter previously forbidden.  I'm not sure what he is trying to prove here.  Everyone stopped going to the movies because of this?  So, it had nothing to do with attendance dropping since the mid-50s, with Vietnam, with the death of urban movie palaces and the total change of the movie going experience, the public's boredom with overblown "roadshow attractions" , with television?    No, actually, because in Mr. Medved's world you can trace anything and everything to a lack of morals.  He points out that the "Sound of Music" won best Picture in 1965, and then "Midnight Cowboy" (about a male hustler) won Best picture in 1969, thereby proving the decline and fall of western civilization.    So, I guess nevermind how many "family" movies of this time period ("Hello Dolly," "Doctor Dolittle", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang," "Greatest Story Ever Told") were total and complete bombs at the box office.    He states that removal of the production code (remember, the decline and fall of western civilization) "hurt the bottom line." And apparently movies have just been utter "filth" ever since?  So, Christians would be hypocritical to own DVDs of the films that came out just after the removal of the Code, that could not have been made before it: "The Wild Bunch," "The Grauduate," "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," "The Producers," "Rosemary's Baby," "Midnight Cowboy," "Bonnie and Clyde."    All of those movies did great at the box office, by the way.  So I'm lost as to how the removal of the Production Code wrecked "the bottom line" in Hollywood.   Oh yes, one other thing:  Michael Medved did the glowing introduction to DeMille's "The Ten Commandments" at the Conservative Film Festival (or whatever its called) in 2004.    DeMille's 1932 film "The Sign of The Cross," jam-packed with violence, sexual perversion, [...]), helped contribute to the Catholic revolt against films, and the enforcement of the Code itself.  Some "scholar" you guys got here.  
 I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special.  
 I Purchased this product in Nov 2006. Reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product, the very best, editor reviews - not user - the product is to new I guess. I looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing, so I thought I would try it - Bummer. Acronis 10 installs fine, sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work, until you verify the images, all are corrupted. I have contacted Acronis several times, they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong.  Nothing has been resolved after 4 1/2 months. The tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware.  I have to keep using Ghost-2003 to do my images, it works fine. Acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem, but I now find references all over the Internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6 
 I found the video mediocre at best.  Much of the video is Dr. Romanov running the same sequence to the same bad music.  While I'm sure he's an excellent coach in person, the video did very little to improve my running.  In fact, because of using his technique, I'm now suffering plantar faciitis as his method stresses running on the balls of your feet (for distance) which stretchs the ligament.    I've looked far and wide for a good instructional running video and unfortunately, this cd is one of the very few in the game.  Buy if you'd like, but caveat emptor!  Using this technique may cause you injury 
 Sure, this book is about the rise of transnational corporations and the influence cultural icons such as Michael Jordan have on it.  However, LaFeber never gets into WHY this is the case.  He throws around the same three points throughout the 164 pages of text, leaving the reader wondering how he could possibly write so much when he realistically has nothing to say.  It is more filled with statistics and dates regarding Michael Jordan, the Bulls, and Nike, than what the title implies.  The book is a good read for fans of MJ and Nike, but if you're looking for a sociological perspective on globalization, look elsewhere 
 This is not a good Tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination. The worse thing about the film is the horrible, unconvincing special-effects! The scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking "It's coming closer!" is badly done and also Dan starting to fly out the window and his dad attaining super-human strength pulling him back into the vehicle is incredibly stupid and not dramatic in the slightest. I know, however, a guy named Mike and 2 robots who would probably have to endure this terrible B-grade movie (Actually F-grade) If you want a good, entertaining tornado movie that doesn't include bad acting, bad "Special" FX, bad script and dumb actors check out "Twister&quot 
 Based on other reviews, I went in with moderate-to-high hopes.  Oh, how mistaken I was.  Instead I was met with a plotless film, which would have been fine if the characters were developed more.  The only character with any color is Hugh Grant's Lord Byron, who plays the part with delicious cynicism and wit.  The rest of the cast is pretty flat--none of them show any of the intellect or personality their real-life counterparts were known to have.  The so-called metaphorical monster is less metaphor and more of a big guy who looks bored and speaks haltingly.  His presence in the film gave me hope that the plot would indeed show up, but alas no.  Apart from fodder for Hugh Grant gazing, the film does have an occasionally topless Elizabeth Hurley in a supporting role, though it took me a minute to recognize her due to her generous eyebrows (must have been filmed in her pre-Estee Lauder spokesmodel days) 
 I am familiar with many of these films and  they have largely fallen through the cracks of time for a good reason, namely THEY SUCK 
 Too much text, not enough drawing. I much prefer Perspective: space and design  by Louise Bowen Ballinger 
 If I ever run into Amy Sohn on the street I am going to ask for my money back.  Seriously.  This book was a feeble and weak attempt at writing.  I think that more than the money, I regret losing every minute of my time that was wasted reading this book. I am all for a thrilling read and witty and provacative fare, but Amy Sohn is nothing more than a boring, remedial, and thoroughly uninteresting exhibitionist.  Maybe Amy Sohn should keep the money - she has no career as a novelist.  I'm cancelling my New York Magazine subscription too 
 I so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book. I read it recently for a book club selection, and let me tell you, If I didn't have to read it, I would have put it down after the first twenty pages, and never picked it up again. I found it to be dark, depraved, disgusting, and depressing! An examination of love in all it forms? Hardly! These characters were just plain goofy. I finally figured it out towards the end of the book, these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually. They were looking to other humans to provide them with true love, and that is just barking up the wrong tree. I am giving it one star only for the rich use of language 
 The cover is by far the best art in this book...  There are some other good ones inside, but most are incredibly poorly drawn and not very erotic at all; why they bothered putting a hard cover on such an amateurish effort is beyond me.  Even the ones that are well drawn mostly just look like normal women with wings added as an afterthought.  Bottom line, I'll snip out a few pictures to keep as art reference and throw away the rest.  
 Worked great for about a week, then i seemed to get an average of 12 telemarketing calls a da 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event! 
 Lang Lang not only didn't know the meaning of tempi, but also the concept of those seemingly banging chords.  Tchaikovsky wrote the concerto when pianos were not as heavily-sounded as they mainly are today.   Peter Ilyich perhaps expected the glory and zest of a Liszt and the silky singing quality of a Chopin would co-exist in this concerto (or on a pianist?), therefore, there exist so many uncomfortable moments, so many "combating" moments, in which the pianist - with the assistance of the conductor and a knowing orchestra - transform the bitter into the glorious, not the boastfulness.  According to Lang Lang, music celebrities like Barenboim and Tirmirkanov coach him (via possible ways like through international phone calls, and etc.) This sounds magnificent, but after some careful humble thoughts you would know that the sense of profundity can hardly be transmitted by telepath.  Lang Lang might have single-handedly beaten many other pianists in the speed round with a twist of boyish charm, but his Tchaikovsky surely sounded VERY boyish while the delicately virtuoso Mendelssohn sounded virtuously boring.           Tut mir leid 
 I bought the book because I have a new Bernina emboidery machine, although this book has excellent photos, and step by step projects, it only shows designs and examples from most machine but Berninas. If you are trying to but a book as a reference for projects, this book is great. I will have to keep looking for something that shows at least one example on a Bernina machine, and more information on how to get designs from a computer, internet, and the use of the magic box 
 This dictionary is just another long-winded, pretentious, unreadable, high-brow attempt to legitimize anthropology. The authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology. If you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class, and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions, forget this book 
 With no index and no maps, it's hard to find information in this book.  Consequently, it's a waste of money 
 OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.  No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays 
 ...100% Guano.  To think a tree had to die for this crappola 
 Laura Shumar read my mind when she posted her review.    Bujold is by far my favorite writer, living or dead.  Hers is the only fiction, other than Shakespeare's, that I read with pencil in hand so that I can mark special passages.  I have read all of her books multiple times, with the exception of "Diplomatic Immunity."  "The Hallowed Hunt" will now join it on the far end of the shelf.    I will still buy her next book as soon as it is available, but with trepidation 
 What I liked about this book is that it makes use of documents and materials from both the West and the Communist World.  It is an interesting mix and a fair look at both sides of the Cold War.  But there is the  problem as well.  Too much of the book and the evidence from both the US  and USSR at times contradict each other, while at other times supports each  other.  In short, the chapters are confusing.  Who is right?  Who is wrong?   For example their Cuban Missile Crisis chapters where interesting, but  heck if I can draw a conclusion as to what really happened.  Also, the  title.  The title is wrong.  It is clear that the US and the West one the  cold war.  I think that is an undisputed fact.  So again, the book has good  information, but it is at times too much.  The book is ultimately too much  info and not enough conclusions 
 Yes, actually I do. To warn potential readers from reading the most crappy book in the face of the Earth. Gerald betraying his adored Ellen? Mammy betraying her most loved mistress? Ashley being gay? (Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?) Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie) Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?  It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.  Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.  If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature 
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Gosh, where to start?  The casting was so-so, the acting was dire, the sets were appalling...  Although Annette Bening did well and so did Colin Firth, you could not really see how evil they were - especially Colin Firth who just seemed like a bit of an oaf (did he wear false teeth for this movie?)  He had on this really idiotic smile half the time - rather than the scheming smile we should expect from Valmont.  Meg Tilly acted as if she was reading straight from an autocue.  And Danceny!  Eugh. For some reason, France was made to seem like a perpetual carnival as well.  What was it with the street scenes?    Just don't even bother.  If you want to see Dangerous Liaisons, go see the one with Malkovich and Close.  You can definitely feel the underlying current of emotions throughout the entire film 
 THE LORD OF THE RINGS   I was a teenager back in the mid and late 70s, and JRR Tolkien's popularity was inescapable. I started reading THE HOBBIT, which is a little prequel to this. I don't think I finished it, and I know I never tackled THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I found Tolkien hard to read. Imaginative, sure, and no doubt thematic, but it was like Margaret Mitchell. Unreadable. (Don't start -- I'm from the South.)   Later, I saw an animated version of the trilogy on TV which lasted somewhere between 90 and 120 minutes. Naturally it made no sense, because you can't compress all that into such a short time span.   Then, I gave up on Tolkien and played another game of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. I was addicted, folks. Role Playing Games are an author's playground. I didn't play as much as I wanted, because I was too much in demand as a Dungeon Master. Naturally.   But now, in this millennium, let's watch some movies! I live in China, where the trilogy cost me 20 yuan. For those keeping score at home, about US$2.50.   THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING   It was a bit slow getting started, presenting all the back story, but I was surprised later on when I needed it and remembered it so well. Okay, yep, Tolkien's got game. Given his popularity, one would sincerely hope so.   You absolutely have to love the look of Middle Earth. How are they able to adjust everybody's heights? Most of the special effects are impressive.   Most importantly, somehow I feel sure the filmmaker stayed true to Tolkien's vision. In fact, I read somewhere that he did.   I never found elves quite so annoying in my Dungeons & Dragons days as I do now. I bet they never sweat, do they? They talk in riddles and glow too much, but I guess that happens when you live too long.   The various species are quite distinguishable, aren't they? So are different members of the same species. This is masterful. It's a skill far too few modern authors possess. Either everybody in the book seems like the same person, or else each character seems to belong to a stereotype of some sort. Tolkien avoids both pitfalls while simultaneously acknowledging that, yes, sometimes it's reassuring to a person/character to have a stereotype to fall back upon for a sense of identity when circumstances require.   Once our fellowship finally goes into battle, we get some great sequences. Among many fine performances, those of Frodo and Gandalf stand out in my mind. Oh, and "never toss a dwarf," which I KNOW Tolkien didn't write. Anxiously awaiting part two.   THE TWO TOWERS   What's more boring than real world politics? Fictional politics! I don't believe Tolkien spent this much time on the war aspect. Well, I hope he didn't. Saruman makes a bunch of uber-Orcs and sics 'em on humanity. Fine. We don't need a cast of thousands to spend hours in mock battles. Nor do we need the lamest excuse for a "love story" in cinematic history.   But once we FINALLY get past all that, I believe we get back to the Tolkien vision. Here's hoping we stay there for part three.   (Two hours, two paragraphs. What's wrong with this picture?)   THE RETURN OF THE KING   A balanced attack. That's what THE TWO TOWERS lacks but THE RETURN OF THE KING has. By this, I mean that long sustained fight sequences are boring. That's not your "action," unless your name's Jackie Chan. Give us just enough fight to let us move from plot point to plot point, then switch over to the real conflict before we get bored and leave the theater.   {No hate mail from Jackie Chan fans, please. I love SHANGHAI NOON.}   The real drama comes in the interpersonal, and in Frodo versus that @#$%^* ring. Gollum is one freaky deaky, ain't he? Liv Tyler is still unwatchable, but fortunately her screen time was minimal.   We get very close to the end of this film before Hollywood excess creeps into the war scenes. Those very cool elephants, for example, seem unstoppable. I was quite impressed with Orlando Bloom's quietly effective performances, but I'll never believe his computer simulated double took down one of those big bad muthas. Those elephants are doomsday machines, and the heroes' strongholds were Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Meanwhile back at the ranch, perhaps we had one too many dramatic rescues that stretched credibility. Sam the Hobbit versus HOW MANY orcs? Um, lest we forget, he's only a freakin hobbit!   I don't know if it was the screenwriters who wrote themselves into a corner or perhaps Tolkien himself. But, well, somebody damn sure did. Let's floor the gas over those speedbumps and see what's on the other side.   Unlike some critics, I appreciated that this film didn't end at the "climax." We needed some more time to just hang out in Middle Earth, well over 9 hours after we entered the place, without all that pseudo-violent cast-of-thousands FX crap.   However, anyone who left on the elf ships is a geeberhead, and that includes the entire elven race. You can leave your Shire without leaving your world, Tolkien. I did. I've been in China since 1999.   THE VERDICT   I appreciate Tolkien's imagination, and I'm glad the film people made this. But I know it could be so much better with an editor. Yeah, I'm talking about changing what Tolkien wrote if required.   (There goes another subscriber...)   I read somewhere that so many people write in this genre because they don't think Tolkien wrote enough. I disagree. I think they write in this genre because they know they can do it better.   (And there goes another subscriber...)   Nothing about this movie changed my opinion. I was happy to watch it once, but I can't imagine anyone wading through it twice. I've swapped it for a copy of the GODFATHER trilogy, which I'll review in a future issue of WHO MOVED MY RICE?  
 This book was obviously not written from experience. Minnery pretends to be an expert, but falls way short and even shorter as an author. I've read non-fiction accounts that have far more useful information in a few  paragraphs than this whole book has. A real disappointment, don't waste  your money or time 
 I really don't care about whether the book has historical inaccuracies; that's why it's called "FICTION".  But what I could not stand was the plot's complete lack of plausibility.  The author is almost trying to mimic the formula of the success of the Da Vinci Code but fails miserably.  Da Vinci Code succeeded because it was able to interwove the historical facts and fictional aspects and made them BELIEVABLE and entertaining at the same time.  However, this book does neither.  Characters are very stiff and shallow, often you don't understand why and what they're doing, and the interaction between the main character and his ex wife is so cheesy that it's like reading conversations between two junior high kids.  Save yourself from wasting hours of your life by NOT reading this book.    
 I found this a very difficult book to keep motivated to keep reading.  It is written more for the person that deals with various brain studies 
 If you believe that all men are out to get you, if you believe that all men are potential rapists, or if you believe that sex is a weapon men use to opress women, then this is the book for you! I imagine you will read the book while looking tentatively over your shoulder, fearing some evil man may pass by.  I always weigh every book I read objectively, trying to find a balance and see both sides of the argument. However, Andrea Dworkin makes this an impossible task for any sensible and rational person.  Even a cursory inspection of this book will make it a glaring certainty that the themes here are paranoia, hate, and fear. If you believe the psychotic rantings of Andrea Dworkin, all men hate all women (this isn't a negotiable idea), and sex couldn't possibly be an act that a woman might consensually enjoy with a man. No, if you believe the ravings of this madwoman, all men are rapists that use sex to "keep women in their place". No woman ever "really" wants to have sex with a man. But, alas, women are forced to have sex with men. And if a man ever sees a woman experiencing happiness, he immediately devises a way to rob her of it. Give me a break.  If you enjoy or agree with these kind of theories, don't have a penis, or are lacking common sense, then you will love this book.  It's funny how Andrea Dworkin preaches (high and blind in her lunatic ivory tower) about the need for a woman to control her own life, yet goes on to tell women that they cannot be happy with a man or enjoy sex with one, which takes away the exact choice she rages about. One thing she professes, in no uncertain terms, is that if you're a woman that does not agree with her, then you are a detriment to all woman. In the real world, we call people like her dictators.  Even more irritating than her inane diatribes, is her complete and total lack of credible evidence or argument. There are no facts, only paranoid opinions. Andrea Dworkin truly believes that the whole of the male species is out to get her.  What's really disheartening about all this is that there are so many women fighting for true equality (and not the complete subjugation men). Unfortunately, paranoia is contagious, and a few other women have turned to this sort of radical feminism. Studies have shown, time and again, that the vast majority of these radical feminists have been either raped or molested at some point in their lives. So it's safe to say that these women are extremely biased, provide no evidence of any kind, and make up blatant lies to support their "cause". And yet they purport to speak for all women. It's clear that these women, just like Andrea Dworkin, are the real detriment to women everywhere.  But I'm not worried. Most women, like myself, still love men, and will continue to ignore the ravings of the lunatic fringe. And that makes the radicals madder than anything.  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life reading this ridiculous drivel 
 My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron.  I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge.  Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song.  I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time.  Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real  she still was upset for the rest of the night.  I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it.  I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it.  I know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well 
 Ehhh, well here goes... some of this is decent. I say that with a fair amount of self-consciousness since Staind isn't really taken that seriously these days - and rightfully so. But Dysfunction, for all its cliche nu metal-ness, has a unique gritty atmosphere and some decent tunes.  Early Staind is radio post-grunge crossed with a third rate Korn immitation, but it does have its charms. The guitarist borrows heavily from Korn's impressionistic chord-writing. Unlike a lot of radio bands these days, they didn't bury that strength (and the band's tone in general) under layers of sickeningly sweet production. In fact much of this record gets by on its sound rather than its songwriting. It seethes with frustration and the band have a good feel for each other.  I can't say Aaron Lewis's lyrics "seethe" with anything, unfortunately. They're mostly whiney mommy and daddy stories and his melodies aren't even that strong. This is another department in which Staind shamelessy robs their Korn forefathers blind. Lewis seems to have missed the point in Jonathan Davis's lyrics, seeing in his spit and bile an excuse to cry and moan. At the same time, the woe-is-me act does sort of add to the comedy of Staind in general.  It has some solid and catchy tunes, such as "Just Go", "Mudshovel" and "Home", and the rest is peppered with decent and occasionally inspired guitar riffs. The song structures are often haphazard and wander off track in uninteresting ways, but the vibe maintains throughout. It does what it does pretty well 
 In the introduction (pg.6) Ms. Hoppen notes, that after 11 September..."a perfect show house no longer mattered. Having a home that really was a home that really was a home did." So I wonder why all the really gorgeous photographs in this book really do not demostrate that people actually live in these homes. The rooms are devoid of individual personality and really do appear to be perfect show rooms. Personal artifacts are removed from the photographs, replaced with props and items that are fabricated for Ms. Hoppen and for sale on links on her web sites or by the vendors listed in the "Address Book" section of her book (read product placement). With that said there are a worthwhile morsels in this book and the photographs are wonderful, especially if you are looking for interesting and minimal examples of door and window trim, floral arrangement ideas, or you are designing a spiral staircase.  The text portion of the book is very useful for the design process of building a home and the photographs seem to be blue prints come to life, but without any sentimental indications of the lives of the people who might be moving into these homes. The window treatment section should be licenced by Smith and Noble and used in their catelog. 
 Using the Color Wonder Finger Paints is basically like dipping your hand in Vaseline.  It's greasy, hard to wash off, and stains.  I would never buy this again nor for anyone else.  I strongly urge against purchasing this product.  Crayola, shame on you 
 You may love your kids, the smell of a newborn baby, and finger paintings, but Bill Keane's trecherously unfunny and maudlin anthology is unbearable. While it is clear Family Circus contains neither razor-like wit nor social commentary, the offensively poor quality of Keane's humour will be come inevitably clear as you turn the second page. After 40+ years of writing this comic strip, surely Keane's capacity for humour is no longer what it once was. However, astonishingly, upon viewing Keane's first Family Circus comic in the 1960s, it became clear that there never was any humour in it. No 
 This is camp and camp... and more camp.... but Bruce wouldn't touch it.  Bad acting, racial stereotypes, and more bad acting.  On the up side the make-up wasn't that bad, and I bet they had fun making this thing.  Plot goes something like this; evil movie theatre traps people to turn them into demons to take over the world... or something like that.  Warning!!!! This movie will not scare you!!!  I give it 2 on the camp-o-meter, because this really is what camp is about (just not good camp)... not much for memorable lines however.  The Pimp steals the show 
 		Asking an alleged humourist to explain economics is similar, with all due apologies to Mark Twain, to asking a dog to dance on its hind legs;  it can be done, but it serves no useful purpose and merely annoys the dog.  	Granted, economics can be funny.  Stephen Leacock was an economist of the last century who wrote the classic 'Sunshine Sketches of a Small Town'.  In contrast to O'Rourke's nattering negative nonsense, Leacock's humour was "the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof."  There's no danger of O'Rourke's bitter bile becoming a classic or being remembered for its humour.  	"Humour" and "kindly" do go together.  If O'Rourke ever read Leacock, he didn't learn much.  This book is a 1950s-rant against the evils of socialism, completely ignoring that one of the most successful socialist societies was the Jesuit missions among the Guarani of Paraguay.  This decent, humane and prosperous society was crushed by free enterprise slavers who wanted quick profits by making slaves of the Guarani rather than teaching them harmony in hymns.  Likewise, the ongoing success of the Salt River Project in Arizona, according to one of its directors a few years ago, "is proof that socialism works."  	Socialism can work, but it requires people with the qualities of saints.  The difference between O'Rourke's rant and the reality of earthly socialism was aptly seen by Leacock, who explained "socialism won't work except in Heaven, where they don't need it, or in Hell, where they already have it."  In other words. O'Rourke needs to learn it's not funny to beat a dead horse.  	Smith wrote an eloquent explanation of what happens when people are allowed to follow their own interests.  This is the most basic right of all people, it is the essence of democracy.  O'Rourke doesn't seem to understand this;  instead, he thinks, "an examination of any democractically elected government leads to deep puzzlement about why democracy works."  	Oh?  My humble observation is that American democracy is an inspiration for the world.  In other words, it works.  Try and find a better system.          In O'Rourke's view, justice is merely a "cash register" to provide government revenues.  In Smith's view, "every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free . . . . ."  Smith justifies interference with the freedom of individuals when it is necessary to protect consumers;  O'Rourke seems to think of it as merely another form of tax.  Maybe he should drive with greater consideration for others, to cut down on his traffic tickets.  	In brief, O'Rourke doesn't understand Smith, the modern world or the incongruity of humour.  Or perhaps, in his defence and in terms of those who hate every success of America, O'Rourke understands everything all too well and wants to return to the perfect freedom of Rousseau's savages.  	Conspiracy theorists believe tragedy is the product of a diabolical axis-of-evil plot.  In contrast, O'Rourke is an omni-theorist who thinks everything is a conspiracy.  Perhaps his next book will explain how the Vatican, al Qaeda and Mickey Mouse are partners in a vast multi-wing conspiracy to inundate him with traffic tickets, or perhaps to make buttered toast land butter-side down when it falls from the table.  	With it, he might tap a source of humour.  Until then, he should think about why petty-minded zealots are never funny.   
 I did a little research after trying to install this product and found that Symantec is no longer rated very well for Anti Virus.  One site that states this is Consumer Reports (they are towards the bottom of the ratings).  It has become major bloatware and its stability isn't what it used to be.  Maybe this is why Peter Norton sold his interests and bailed out.  I am far from being a novice, but this thing gave me a fight the whole way.  So on with my saga.  First, this product was supposed to be for Windows XP and 2000 Pro.  Even the box says this.  But when I insert the CD in a W2K Pro machine all I got was an error box showing the error icon and the OK button.  Real informative.  Going through the back door I try to install without going through the CD autostart program.  Now I get a box that says it requires XP 32 bit.  So that leaves out 2 of the machines I bought this for.  So I go to a machine running XP.  First one loads OK, but it says it is incompatible with my firewall (ZoneAlarm) which I happen to trust a lot.  Then on the second machine it goes through the install (which takes 45 min) and then runs the autoupdate and hangs halfway through.  I finally had to abort it after it sat there an hour (I was hoping it was just another slow moment).  Rebooted and the program was no longer running.  Starting it up myself resulted in it failing to load.  Now I'm stuck, it won't allow me to uninstall nor reload it again.  Had to obtain a removal tool from their web site and it promptly removed every Symantec product on the machine.  Maybe this was the writing on the wall?  By now I'm a couple days into the drama.  Meanwhile, the first XP machine that loaded fine did another automatic update and guess what.  It locked up half way through.  Now it will not run and had to be removed the same way.  So I am now the proud owner of ZoneAlarm's Internet Suite.  It cost less than the NAV (both 5 user versions), and loaded much faster.  Ten minutes and I was done, where it was an hour into NAV when things worked and it loaded.  I am taking this up with Symantec and trying to get a refund.  They can keep it.  I've been less satisfied with every upgrade and this one finally broke the camel's back.  Maybe I'll try again someday if I come up with a new camel, but they don't grow well in Seattle.  ADDED 3-12-2007:   I have also noted that after removing NAV that things I could not explain before have been cured.  For instance, the web site [...] would not load many of it's pages correctly, they would show the text coding instead of html.  Now that I am NAV free, all of the pages on this site load with no problems.  Hmmmm.. 
 I give this one star only because the site won't let me give it zero.  After agonizing through the first hundred pages of this book just to see if it got any better (it didn't) I was so disgusted with his tiresome prose and graphic accounts of slave beatings that I literally threw the book in the trash.  Slavery was wrong, Mr. Davis, we get it, now get on with what we are to learn that we supposedly never did. My conscience got the best of me regarding tossing the book, though, since I have a certain reverence for books (even bad ones) so I fished it out of the trash and put it on the exchange table at work in case some masochist feels compelled to delve into it in its entirety.  I bought it at Goodwill for $1.50; I see why it got sent to Goodwill.  It's not one to keep in a collection.  In fact, if we were still using Sears & Roebuck catalogs in outhouses.... 
 I have enjoyed all the Cat Who Books . Have owned or borrowed or went to library to read them. Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have 
 This is required text for a graduate course I am taking, and I want to pull my hair out while being forced to read it. The political correctness in this book is overdone. One serious problem I had with this textbook was the way in which it seemed to start off on page 100 instead of page 1, because there is no introduction to Organizational Behavior. I don't know what to make of chapter 1...an HR manager's guide to political correctness on the job? The need to promote for diversity rather than for work performance? That is certainly what I got out of it. (Down with all white male CEOs!). It certainly doesn't introduce the diligent student to this subject. Sentences are long, drawn out, wordy. Concept paragraphs take a long time to come to the point.  I find myself daydreaming by the time I've read half a page and have to start over, and part of this problem is that every page includes at least one sidebar. On page 40 of this text, the author talks about Feng Shui and it's three C's of design: clean, clear, and comfort, followed by this question: "What about the chi in your work and personal spaces--are you taking best advantage of "good" chi?" I do not recommend this book either for personal growth or for use as a textbook 
 Can Quilleren and his cats figure out who is responsible for the fraud, where the president of the company is, and where all that money went? Qwilleran is a columnist in his local paper.  Everyone is in love with his column because he writes so well.  But when Floyd Trevelyan hosts a party train ride costing $500 a ticket, and says he will give the money to a charity for a college, but then things happen.  Someone calls an audit on him and he goes missing with the money.  When a dog is killed and a body is turned up suspicions rise.  Where is Floyd Trevelyan? Where is the money? Who killed the dog and the man? But then when clues pop up, and his cats Koko and Yum Yum since of mystery help, Qwilleran figures out that Floyd's new secretary killed Floyd and took the money, and the other deaths were from his son and another man in a feud.  At the end Qwilleran figures out that the secretary was really a man, and tells the cop they are looking for the wrong name. He then reads to his cats. I didn't really like this book.  There were way too many characters to keep track with.  The story line didn't go like a normal mystery.  Also, it didn't explain what happened afterwards.  In this book there were tons of characters.  So much that I couldn't even keep track of all of them.  You had to remember the whole Trevelyan family the dad, the mom, the son, and the sister.  You had to remember all of Quillerens friends, and also all his business partners and staff.  There were still many of other key people also.  Such as at the end of the book he started naming all these names that figured out the mystery and I didn't know who was who.  This book was not like a normal mystery, but not in a good way.  The whole book was like just a section of their life.  Nothing interesting happened.  There wasn't that made you wondering what was going on, or what was going to happen.  Sure there were little things you wondered about but nothing big.  This made it very boring to read this book.  It didn't even seem like a mystery until the last five pages.  Quilleren figures out the whole mystery, or at least turns the little one there was into a big one. But then after he figures it out, he basically does nothing about it.  This book left you on a cliffhanger.  It didn't explain what happened at the end.  It just stopped at Quilleran reading the book to his cat.  It didn't say if they fount the girl which was actually a man, it didn't tell what happened to all the people and if they found the body.  Also nothing ever happened between Quilleren and Patty.  It also never said where his friend went too.  So really you didn't learn anything at the end except for when he solved the mystery, but other than that, you were clueless.   This book sort of disappointed me.  There were some good things, but mostly bad things.  I wouldn't recommend it to other readers.  It didn't have bad writing, but the story was not well written.   
 This book is a REPRINT, so it was originaly written in a completely different fashion time. The fashion clothes and tips in this book were extremely outdated. Betty Halbreich is an elder so she really doesn't give fashion advice that would fit for someone that is under the age of 30 
 I was looking forward to listening to this CD because I really enjoy Patrick's work, and was let down big-time. I thought this CD was boring and lifeless - I liked only one track. And almost all of the tracks featured other instruments and hardly any keyboard. Huh?  If you like Patrick O'Hearn, listen to Beautiful World and some of his other CDs to get the real feel of his magic. Too bad. 
 The best part of this book was the title.    It's all downhill from there.   I was misled into believing that there would actually be some different and UNIQUE phrases in here.   Being one to write out a greeting card to family and friends at least once a month, I sometimes could use a fresh expression or two.   I bought this book with the assumption that I'd find all that inside.   Sorry to say, this book offers nothing by way of originality.  Do I really need someone to suggest writing these phrases in my greeting cards:  "Have a sensational birthday", "Have a wonderful birthday", "All the best to the best", "Just to keep you on your toes, I like to introduce you as my 1st husband..."   and more ridiculous wording such as that.     I see that it must have just taken money to find a publisher to put this book on the shelves.   Talent and an ability to offer something new was not part of the mix here.  I could find more appropriate wording in a grammar school English paper.  I hope I can at least sell my copy at a flea market for a buck 
 If you are a student, make less than $25K a year, and enjoy staying in rudown versions of Motel 6, then this book might be for you.  First, Argentina is no longer the bargain the authors claim it is. Outside of BA, you can get a decent meal on the cheap, but other than that, expect to pay $90 and up for a decent hotel. Many of the references in the book come from online entries and clearly have not been checked for quality, cleanliness, etc.  Second, per the review(s) below, many of the recommended restaurants have closed - in BA, you are better off going to Puerto Madero and picking a reataurant at random - they are all good.  Third, keep in mind that AR got hammered by the peso devaluation and many cities are still recovering. Cordoba and others can be less than an idyllic vacation spot.  Conclusion - if you are seeking a quality vacation, you are better off using a good travel agancy. You get what you pay for in AR, notwithstanding the claims of the authors 
 This book is great if you have one of the old machines that non one seels any more, but it's worthless forthe owner of a new TiVo. The author obviously knows what he's talking aboiut, but it doesn't matter any more. I sent this back and bought the Von Hagen book, which had the Series @ and tall of the old Series 1 info 
 This was a painful book to read.  There was actually very little about Leonardo in this book ... rather it was filled with the historical happenings.  I was sorely disappointed by the lack of valid material ... much of the book was the author surmising and assuming Leonardo's motives and thoughts.    I forced myself to finish this book - but it was extremely painful!  
 This was an instant library donation.  A few interesting bits but mostly tedious.  If you're a big, big Dylan fan/completist, look for it at your library 
 This album is nothing like Roni's last album: the beats and breaks here are completely repetitive.  Listen to one song and you've basically listened to the whole album.  No guest vocals either, nothing experimental or new.  Just a plain album.  A real let-down after his last album.  The album had potential, but didn't fulfill my expectations.  Get Aphrodite's last album instead.  Much better 
 Dont take me wrong I do love Mariah but this movie is not making any sense to me I mean Mariah doesnt seem very interest to "play" in this movie!!! This movie is all about music music music music music repeating over and over again nothing new nothing has been changed... come on!!! but then Mariah seem to be better in another movie called Wisegirls but again I honestly dont think that Mariah should be an actress herself I mean I think she is better off to be a singer instead of playing movies. Wisegirls she seem like she wanted to have the "attention" and "show-off" like saying in her mind: "Look at me I am in the movie!" I honestly deep in my heart she dont need to be playing in any movies unless she stands up and do her "work" with her actions in the movies not like this and Wisegirls movies. I feel bad for giving this movie a 1 star but I had to say what's my opinion about this movie anyways. Wisegirls was alittle better than this one! 
 Have you ever read a great book and then had been very disappointed with the sequel? That's exactly what will happen if you read Gary Paulsen's series of books starting out with Hatchet. All of his books are great until you read Brian's Return. Brian, the kid who was lost in the Northern Canadian Woods for the whole fall and winter,  is having trouble in high school. His life was chanced ever since his small plane crash into the woods. Now, he's confused because he doesn't understand why some people live the way they do. For example, his old friends always wanting to ride there bikes or play video games at the mall. He gets in a fight with another teenager in his school. The police make him get a little help from an old blind man that helps teenagers with there problems. Brian tells him why he got in a fight, and why he's so different. He thinks Brian should take a visit back to the woods. Of course, he does, but once he goes there isn't really an ending. I didn't like this book because when Brian goes back to the woods, there's no conflict or problem like there is in almost every story. Also, the story focuses on very stupid things like Brian loving tea and Shakespeare' s plays. This book will be disappointing if you read Gary Paulsen's other books, but boring and confusing if you don't read the other books. I wouldn't recommend reading this book for fun 
 After reading so many chick books, I was really expecting something really good out of Carole Matthews, unfortunately I didn't. I thought she put way too much detail into everything, which seemed to drag everything too much. I got bored of all the detail, ad it didn't seem like she was focused on the story. There were no twist to this story it was just plain. I wouldn't recommend this book, and not to mention the last page was the worst.. Bad ending, bad book, period 
 This book was so poorly written that it was hard to follow.  In addition, the story which could have been interesting instead was turned into a big circle which went nowhere.  The characters were meaningless.The author tried so hard to pile layer upon layer of deceit that he ended up piling layer upon layer of schlock instead.  There is a reason why you've never heard of this book. Basically, I think this book was an attempt by the author to show that he had been to Poland. I'm sure the Poles were happy to see him leave 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 Every English major has one writer who is responsible for their journey into the field.  I have two: Muriel Spark and Kurt Vonnegut.  I am not the kind of guy who walks around pretending to be a writer; I am no writer.  I  do, however, love to read about what makes writers tick, what inspires them  to write.  This is one of the reasons I picked up this tiny book--I hoped  it would give me some insight.  I didn't.       The conversations, at  times, are interesting.  But it wasn't worth the cash I shelled out for the  79 pages.  If this had of appeared in a magazine, I would have read it and  not whined.  If this had appeared in a magazine, I wouldn't have wasted  over 10 bucks 
 This book assumes that you know about makeup and is basically a self promoting book about the celebrities the author knows. The first 40 or so pages do discuss makeup tips, but it's overshadowed by the remaining 100+ pages of stories of his famous clientele. Not what I was looking for in a beauty book 
 PEST CONTROL was my first book by Mr. Fitzhugh and 30 pages into it I decided it will probably be my last.  The plot outline--ordinary Joe too fixated on his entomological obsession to notice he's been accidentally mistaken for an international assassin--is an ingeniously set stage ripe for grand comedy.  Alas, the curtain never rises above knee level.  The central events & conversations which must create the grand illusion on which the story hinges are unimaginative, unconvincing, and alas, not very funny.  The story goes from there into an adolescent action slapstick, full of too many hastily-created throwaway characters that mostly showcase the author's lack of descriptive power.  If ever a story cried out for an editor this it it.  His awful similes ("Their hearts were harder than trying to open an oyster with a wet bus ticket.") only look good compared to the juvenile imagination which chases the increasingly implausible plot into an oddly tedious crescendo of casual New York slaughter.  The final resolution tries to leap too many logical potholes to survive the crossing into epilogue intact.  The utter unreality of Fitzhugh's cartoonish world could have been a comedic asset if it were consistent, but it doesn't just migrate as the pages wear on, it gallops away, leaving this reader wondering by the end why he didn't quit on page 30 
 Public Budgeting Systems by Robert D. Lee, Philip G. Joyce, and Ronald Wayne Johnson is written more clearly... if you have a choice, buy this book.  The problem with Mikesell is that he has to write 200 pages (six chapters) to explain the concept of revenues in the budget process.  Too many trees were wasted in the development of this book.  Lee, Joyce, and Johnson can do this in 40 pages.  The greater majority of my Public Budgeting Systems class at George Mason University feels that the Mikesell book is written in a manner to lull oneself to sleep... the benefit is that one could read the book rather than using drugs to induce sleep.  However, if you are required to purchase the Mikesell book, you should go to the Amazon UK web site and complete your transaction there... you can save yourself about 70 to 80 dollars.    
 Another long-winded thesis. It lacks the ONE thing that documentation managers and writers need: the tool. There is not a single example of a project plan or documentation design doc. There is no CD with templates. What a disappointment. By the time I finish reading this, my project will be due 
 I can't believe the way Amazon packed these dishes. They were thrown in a box with virtually no padding. So of course several of the plates were cracked. They are cute. I have asked them to send me another set and hopefully they will ship them better.  One thing I did notice -- the description says dishwasher/microwave safe but the dishes don't have that stamped on the bottom. I am also hoping they abide by our laws regarding lead free but you never know now a days what comes from china. 
 Do not waste your money on this book unless you do not have clue about women.  The book has 12 chapters, only one of which actually addresses the subject matter.  I enjoy eating at the "Y" and love pleasing women while doing so.  I was expecting a "how to" book written from a woman's perspective but what I got was mostly useless feminist babble.  
 Him? Who?  Who's he? Him!  I don't know who he is.  It's him. Who's he!!!  HIM!!!  Alright, ENOUGH!  He is JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP!! He is HIM!! 
 I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.  Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language!  A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
 Having read several books on this subject matter, I expected THE FLIGHT to provide an in-depth insider's point of view of the events in question. I really didn't learn anything new here. And I agree with the other reviewer who said that this translation is terrible. There are several awkward translations of key terms, such as "final stop" for "punto final", the law prohibiting further legal action taken against the military leaders after a certain date. Try Feitlowitz's "A Lexicon of Terror" instead 
 Alice in Wonderland meets Stephen King. When a mysterious blue light enters the souls of a variety of people, good and bad, they receive powers and knowledge beyond this world--whatever gifts they have are made even stronger. But then...strange things start to happen.   The colorful characters, deep symbolism and surreal scenarios make this book a unique thriller with a conclusion that leaves you wondering where fantasy began and reality ended.   Some of the details were a little gory for me and generally overall it was disappointing--maybe because of his venture into Sci-Fi. The info on the back cover enticed me to read it, but alas, I really fought hard to get through this book and decide what I felt about it.   Overall his characters were thinly developed and the story ended abruptly--and I felt, with a bit more effort, could have improved the total results. Maybe I had different expectations because of who the author is--and his reputation with the mystery genre and his Easy Rawlins stories.   Armchair Interviews says: This writer changed genre, and seemed to miss the mark for many SciFi fans.     
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 If you get this used, you won't mind so much that it repeats itself too often and runs out of steam halfway.  I think I am much swayed by the photos, this is a coffee-table book, not a reference book.  I am boggled at the typography decisions, I suppose someone has been reading too much WIRED and thought it looked avant garde.  It does reek.   If you are much into the subject I'd say you will find something to enrich you here, esp if you can get a good deal on the book somewhere 
 i too have stacks of organic gardening and farming. i love to go back and visit Robert Rodale.  Too bad it has become a political bullypulpit. I would not subscribe again with out a major change 
 This scale was off by about 10 or 15 pounds. I went to the doctor a few days after getting this scale and I was so relieved to find out that I was not 10 pounds heavier than I feared. Don't waste your money on a scale that won't give you an accurate weight 
 An absolutely dreadful album, Eve is certainly an apt title--you'll feel as if you've been deceived after listening to this hodgepodge of early 80s FM-ready radio rock. Easily Parsons' worst album, there's really only one listenable song on the entire record. Stick with the far superior APP albums of the late 70s, I Robot, Pyramid, as well as their terrific mid-80s return to art-space rock, Eye in the Sky. It's too bad Eve can't be melted down--it deserves no less a fate 
 Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion.  Not much there.  Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection.  Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books.  I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works.  I don't own  much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place.  I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon 
 I WAS SOOO DISAPOINTED IN THIS BOOK.. I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF FINISH READING IT, AND I'M ONE OF HER BIGGEST FANS.. 
 I was disappointed in The Writers Guide to Everyday Life in Regency and Victorian England, but gave this one a try.  Unfortunately, I think the editors of these books are just lazy when it comes to information.  Both  books covered history with broad generalizations.  There are some useful  items in both, but both are poorly laid out and badly written 
 As a teacher of many years, I've seen a direct correlation between students who do their homework and succeed in life.  I have to wonder what racial background these authors come from--one way to keep the lower class down is to convince them they don't need what is good for them.  The key to successful homework is moderation--homework itself is necessary.  How else are we to prepare our students for the workloads of higher education?  If we do not prepare them, then we have truly done a disservice to them, they will drop out, and remain in the lower class.  Look around--people who are well-off are generally well-educated and have worked hard for some portion of their lives.  Homework is a way to build the kind of work ethic that will get lower class students out of the lower class.  This book maintains the same attitude of the slave owners 160 years ago--don't worry about the [crud] you'll put up with in this life, and don't try to get ahead, you'll be rewarded in the after life.  What a way to support the fatalism of the lower classes 
 in this set, which I gave to my daughter for Christmas, when she unwrapped it, the box was broken on two edges.  We are reading book #3 and the pages have begun falling out.  The quality of the set is the problem.  The stories are wonderful 
 Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, "Reptile," makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with "Backless," "Another Ticket," and "Money & Cigarrettes" all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans 
 I have two good points on these books: One, they're a quick read, and two, a friend lent me a couple, so I didn't waste any money. The first and second ones were kind of fun reads, but I would have enjoyed these more when I was 15, when I didn't have any mileage on me.  As for the mysteries,  the killers weren't totally obvious, but I can't say I'd give credit to Harris' ability to craft a mystery. For me, I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters; I just found them sort of disposable. The lead character, Sookie Stackhouse (yeah, she's got a big rack and vampires and other supernatural beasties, just like most mortal men, can't resist a good pair of melons), has a "disability," which is basically the ability to read minds -- not always a good thing, if you've got all that static to tune out and haven't developed a filter. Sookie isn't that well educated, as in going to college, because she was only good at homework, so she works as a bar maid and prides herself on being book learned and loves to use words from her word-a-day calendar. To her great relief she meets a vampire, Bill, whose mind she can't read, and they begin to date.  In her world, vampires are now legal, with clubs and "fang-bangers" who sleep with vampires, and the Japanese have developed a synthetic blood, making it unneccessary for vamps to feed on humans (not that it's totally stopped them).  But Sookie starts to date Bill, loses her virginity to him (setting up for sex scenes, a big part of the series, which probably are exciting for a virgin to read -- there's no titilation or intriguing detail or seduction here).  In the meantime, Sookie meets more vampires and other supernatural creatures, and ends up using her power to try and solve assorted murders and missing-beings cases. She also gets recruited by vampire Eric (someone who has more power than Bill, and who wants Sookie for more than her telepathy) to help solve various mysteries, and Sookie gets into scrapes along the way. This description, by the way is not plot specific to Book 2, or even Book 1, but that's kind of the pattern that's emerging in the series.  It's basically the misadventures of a busty telepath among the supernatural world. These books are the literary equivalent of potato chips: A couple taste good, but the whole bag isn't going to do much for you except give you fat and empty calories and a stomach ache. At best they are a guilty pleasure, though I give Harris credit for injecting a bit of humor in the books; there are a couple of good laughs (intended ones) 
 I'm in full agreement with Victoria Dew, who's review precedes my own. I was intrigued by the premise of the book but my interest quickly turned to disappointment. Although there are some interesting facts about New Zealand, they are overshadowed by Mr. Masson's thinly veiled sense of self import. Ironic, given the often-sited intolerance New Zealander's have for the tallest poppies (braggarts), of which Mr. Masson is a prime example, and given Mr. Masson's apparent admiration for native son Sir Edmund Hillary who stands in stark contrast as a model of humility.    Contrary to Mr. Masson's supposition that his book would result in a sudden influx of immigrants to New Zealand, I found my interest in the islands diminished by Mr. Masson's work.  What a bore 
 The description for this item is not accurate. I bought the freeze deied raspberries and stawberries from this same company and they are great. However, these are dehydrated which means 2 important things: - Texture: these are very hard and do not soften if left in milk or water. Don't think about adding these to cereal, only for trail mix or eating out of hand. - Saturated fat: the second ingredient is coconut oil! One 2oz. serving has 190 calories, 19 grams of fat and 16 grams of saturated fat. You're better off eating Cheetos.  These are extremely unhealthy and don't even taste that great. There is (unsurprisingly) and oily aftertaste. Buyer beware. Stick to purely freeze dried fruits - nothing is added and they are healthy 
 Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page.  That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from 
 Do not buy if you want to use with Palm OS! Spent two hours getting this book into my palm treo 600 only to have it not open. Transferred fine, just wont open. 
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 The book has no color at all, everything is in black and white; also the case files found in the book are briefed and are poor reflections from the orginal public documents.  I had to buy this book for a college class, it was cheaper here than in the school book store but I feel the book is only worth $20 
 Rising Sun was a terrible read.  Crichton uses one device throughout:  the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him.  It's tiring and monotonous.  Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures. 
 Well, what can one say when a band is this BAD!? Thank god I didn't buy their crap, just unfortunately heard it somewhere. Please, save your money for REAL music 
 Frabato (Bardon) battles the Evil Lodge on the eve of WWII.  This book is written in a "Flash Gordon Vs. The Cosmic Meanies" style, further fractured through the services of a bad translator.  If this is Bardon in action, then imagine a scratchy sound track, really evil bad guys in black suits and top hats, and the ultimate good guys being Koot Hoomie and His Ascended  Masters gliding to the rescue on flying carpets.  Bardon's secretary wrote this one and I really believe she was planning to farm this script out to Fritz Lang. At most, quaint, at worst, a disappointment to anyone seeking enlightenment on the Hermetic front. 
 I was so excited when a friend (knowing how much I'd loved "The Secret Life of Bees") sent me a copy of "The Mermaid Chair." That excitement was dampened a bit when I read the story synopsis-- as a Catholic, I'm heartily tired of stories involving monks, priests or nuns having illicit affairs. Deciding to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt, however, I plowed ahead and started reading.  My initial opinion of the writing was poor, and it remained as such throughout the tome. In "Bees," Kidd wrote magically-- her words were as almost as sweet as the honey she penned about. This mermaid tale, however, was a completely different animal-- the style was totally altered, almost as though it was written by another (and much less talented) author. Basically, it didn't flow; it moreorless limped from chapter to chapter.  I also found the main character very hard to like or root for. I didn't mind that she was having a midlife crisis-- some people have their most interesting experiences as a result of such inner conflict-- but her reaction to it was childish, petulant and ultimately harmful to her supposed loved ones. For example, instead of telling her husband what's on her mind (a husband who, incidentally, is described as nothing but genial and accommodating), she runs away and has an affair. I would've been much more inspired by this character if she'd channeled her passionate energies into something else, something bold and brave and true-- NOT avoiding her husband (as though he, not she, were the reason her artistic aspirations were frozen) and having sex with a monk.  And yes, my reservations about reading a story involving a religious having sex were not without merit. I was particularly disgusted when, during one of their romps together, she tasted "the wine" in his mouth left over from Mass. Catholics believe that during the course of Mass, the wine changes into Christ's blood, so you can understand why I found that passage really quite offensive and sacriligious. And maybe that's why, when I grimly finished the book shortly thereafter, I deposited it in the wastebasket rather than in a donation pile-- I would hate to pass such a story on.  All in all, I found nothing to praise in this book, nothing that inspired me as "Bees" did, nothing that made me nod and smile and feel enriched afterward. Instead, I was by turns bored, irritated and offended. I didn't expect a "Bees" copycat, but I did expect, when leafing through those pages, to feel the magic again. It just didn't happen 
 Jet Li as a contrac killer? Come on! The reason why this movie isn't that famous is because it pretty much sucks. It's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie. No realy kung fu here 
 I normally don't like to write bad reviews; however, I'm compelled to do so for the Linksys WCG200 version 2 due to the chronic instability of the device.  I'm truly sorry I bought this device and I'm frustrated at Linksys since they do not appear to be offering any firmware updates to fix the issues.  Both my wife and I work from home, so device outages are readily apparent.  We have a Comcast broadband connection that has proved reliable since we got it in 2001.  Until we bought the WCG200 , we were using separate devices for the cable modem, router, and wireless functions and decided to upgrade to the WCG200 since it has all three functions integrated.  Below is a list what I have observed in the last 4 months of using the WCG200.  I've found several Internet posts that detail similar issues for other folks.  There seems to be a correlation of these issues with Comcast users; however, that may not be conclusive since Comcast has such large market share.  1. Frequent crashing of the device when wireless users are connected.  The device will often stop responding and require a reboot.  When we're using its wireless capabilities this occurs several times per day.  If we don't use the wireless, the crashes still occur; however, they are markedly less frequent.  I've also noticed that changing the wireless security settings seems to change the frequency of crashes.  The device would crash hourly when using WPA or WPA2 security.  2. The administration pages stop responding after the device has been running for some time (usually about a day or two).  In this case, the unit will still process traffic; however, I must reboot it to get into the administration interface.  3. The administration pages (when working) sometimes stall for 30-60 seconds.  4. The modem log doesn't always work properly.  I've cleared the log and had old entries come back after a reboot.  To be fair, Linksys does make other devices that work better.  I've been a Linksys customer for several years...while I've seen quality issues before they usually come out with a firmware upgrade to address them. 
 Not very exciting...cake part actually tasted a bit stale.  They just didn't seem very special...sorta like commercial snake cakes.  At 50 cents a cake/bite, not worth it.  At least they were pretty 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 I only glanced through this book, yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied.  I can, however, write about one of the editors, Mike Shaw, who made no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence' when assessing us as parents.  He works as a Consultant Child Psychiatrist in London, England and seems to specialise in offering his services as an 'expert witness' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the Mental Health Act.   We had our children taken away on the grounds that they were "at risk of neglect". Mike Shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations. Yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched. Under cross examination, he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations.  Luckily for us, he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist.  I don't know about his co-editors, but if his work is anything to go by, the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced.  Here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court.  Judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously.  Evidence-gathering. "On 9.8.02, I interviewed Mr & Mrs Orman [2 hours] "On 21.8.02, I met the family at Trent Park where I spoke to Mrs Orman alone [40 mins], witnessed contact [1 hour] and spoke to the children without their parents [20 mins] [and] I interviewed the foster carer [2 hours].  Observations. "Mr & Mrs Orman were friendly and co-operative throughout.[...] Mr Orman showed insight [... but] wasn't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children. The couple were very robust in refuting the [welfare's] account, which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation.  "Contact took place in the park[...]The parents and children seemed happy to see each other; they chatted in animated style. [...] I wasn't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children's presence   "[Interviewing the children] The children seemed attentive [...] but answered "don't know", fell silent and looked at each other when I asked them questions [...] Erin related [a Simpsons episode where] Homer [...] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside. I found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about Mr Orman's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed. [Note. This is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document!]  Conclusions & Recommendations "[...] I observed Mrs Orman as shy and anxious while Mr Orman was very pleasant but forceful. [...]  "Mr and Mrs Orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children. So it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact. [...] I think there is some insecurity in the children's attachment to their parents. [Note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park.]  "Were Mr Orman to be caring for the children on his own, I would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs. [...] Asked whether he had any regrets, Mr Orman didn't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care. [...] Erin [who was 8 at the time] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper, and support and advise socially. I suspect Mr Orman would find this difficult.  "My concern about Mrs Orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness. [...] I wonder whether Mrs Orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [sic] children.   "[...]The children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact I observed [sic] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home.  "[...] returning home is likely to further retard the children's social and emotional development. [...]  "These children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse. [...] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause. I also find very plausible Ms [Charlotte] Curran's suggestion (... [in] her [written] statement) that Mr Orman dominates his wife.  "The children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me, but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible. [..] I believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers. [...] contact should be gradually reduced."  Mike Shaw's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities, but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation. Yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed, so that the children could lead a normal and happy life. He could not comment on government statistics that show that 70% of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents.  Our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt; and the case was eventually closed.  So much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions 
 I have read several books in the Dummies series and found them all excellent, so when it was time to learn SQL for a programming project I got this one immediately.  Unfortunately, SQL for Dummies, turned out to be that absolute worst technical book I have ever laid eyes on.  It jumps from topic to topic without ever really explaining anything.  It uses examples that are unecessarily complex -- I get the feeling his examples just come from years of working with databases, rather than a desire to illustrate any particular thing -- and the examples are never explained.  Over and over, there will be a snippet of SQL code used as an example, and I will wonder, "what does this or that part of the statement do?"  But he never explains anything.  He just throws it out there and then moves on.  Dummies books always have a conversational tone, but the tone in this book is overly hokey and just reads like meaningless filler; all the more frustrating because there isn't really any content that it's filling in between.  All I wanted was the basics of database design and interaction, an enumeration of the commands used for creating and interacting with databases and why some actions are useful and for what, and examples throughout of how one would do typical things.  Instead I got an intolerable and incoherent ramble 
 I was excited to begin reading this book because the author has good credentials and I find the subject matter fascinating.  Imagine my disappointment after I began reading it and discovered that it seemed to be written in a style that was designed to challenge a reader to get through the material.  The sub title of this book should have been "or why you hated your history textbooks in high school".  Surely there must be a way to take this interesting material and write it in a way that makes it a good read.  If you want to make your high school age child hate to study American history force them to read this book next time they deserve to be punished.  In all fairness the picture on the dust jacket of the book was pleasant.  Apparently this author has won some impressive prizes for his other books.  It is no surprise that he didn't win for this one.  It almost makes a reader surmise that it was edited with the intent to bury interesting material in a sea of boring writing style.  Could the writing have been worse?  Probably yes.  Was it really edited with the intent to make it unpleasant to read?  Probably not.  Should you buy this book?  Only if you have to write a paper on The Founders and you can't find any other resource material (even then I'd suggest you either buy it used or try and find it at the library because you will be disappointed to have spent good money on this poorly written book.)  Was it a book you'd be glad to read?  Hardly.  Does it contain interesting information?  Yes.  But is it readable?  Barely 
 This product does work and produces great tasting water--for a while.  I thought maybe we'd done something to make it leak, but a guest said his did the same thing in about the same amount of time (approx 8 months).    There's a part of the filter assembly that becomes loose and leaks, and then eventually squirts water all over the place.  There is no way to fix it.    We won't be buying this brand again.  
 Again we have some Christians trying to escape biblical and moral requirements.  We have a problem with religion today in that many want to be a Catholic for example but can not comply with the rules.  Each religion does have a moral path or rules of engagement.   According to Lev. 18 it is a blasphemy for a man to lay with another man.  Jesus himself does not directly say that homosexuality is wrong but he does not attack most sin.  He does however make it clear to "keep my fathers laws".  There are 613 LAWS from G_d (the father) and Lev 18 is of course is part of them.   Christians seem to be occupied with homosexuality though there are many sins just as bad under the eyes of G_D.   Christians have historically denied the commandment of Jesus to keep his fathers laws  and those two in Mark 12 28-32 and thus by history or culture refuse most of them. Examples of this are: Exodus 20 4th comm. SABBATH, Kosher food laws and many more.  Its as though Christianity was allowed (so it would seem) to pick and choose what G_d wanted.    Jews look at this issue like this:  The laws were given to the "chosen" and therefore Gentiles must only follow the 7 laws of Noah in Genesis 9. The laws for the Gentiles (NOAH was the first GOYEM-Gentile)  These by the way are paraphrased in Mathew.  So, to a JEW its fine for a Christian to be gay as the laws of NOAH do not state homosexuality as a sin.  Now, there are Catholics and other denominations of Christianity who over the course of history have made sure that certain sins are still treated as such.  This is partly the influence of Paul and the Nicean Council.  If one is a Catholic and is also a homosexual then by the doctrine of this faith you must either repent or leave the faith.  I dont understand why so many try to justify loop holes.  If ones son for example is gay and they are Catholic or for that matter Orthodox Jew then they must be forgiven but...they can not be of that faith.  Rules of engagment.   I am a adult male and can not join the girl scouts becuase of my age and gender. Religions have rules too and if you are unable to follow them by the "book" then try one you can.  Its very simple.  Besides, why belong to a faith or any group that goes against your lifestyle?  Its like a JEW wanting to be a member of the KKK  or a gay man wanting to be Catholic. Rules are rules.   
 I wish that when I purchased this subscription I would have read all of the reviews.  Unlike the description included on the Amazon website, the subsription does NOT include the CD-ROM, which costs an additional $1/issue.  And, if you want to purchase the CD-ROMs for past issues, they cost $4/disk.  Sometimes a bargain isn't really a bargain.  Buyer beware 
 I am a huge Tananarive Due fan---My Soul to Keep is one of my favorite books and The Living Blood is not far behind.  So it pains me to say just how disappointed I was with Joplin's Ghost.  It is clear that Ms. Due has given up her true voice to keep up with urban drivel that has, for some unknown reason, become so popular as of late.  Joplin's is an easy read--which is not a good thing, as it lacks the dimension and coplexity of her previous works.  The Joplin piece was interesting but the rest of the story tries to be hip and falls way short of the mark. I hope that Ms. Due finds her way back to her voice. 
 Pros: - Mechs are a bigger part of the games (you actually have to use them), - The graphics of the cutscreens are great, and the graphics overall are better     than before, - A couple of the characters look better, - Much harder than Episode I, - More optional bosses,  Cons: - New battle system is a load of mouse spunk (can I say spunk?), - Most characters look worse (especially Kos-Mos), and Jin travels    throughout space with no pants on, - Almost all of the sidequests are terrible, - Very short, - The story is much weaker, - The dictionary is gone; and so are Shion's glasses, - No shops. Why are there no shops? - Too much more to list.  Just bad.  The movie "Howard the Duck" is better than    this 
 Does D.S. know any other law schools besides, Harvard and Yale for her characters to have attended. I am so tired of her books...this is it for me.  Its the usual suspects for her...rich and white....quite boring.  I used to love her and would read anything from her, but those days are over.....Maybe she should retire 
 Just when it seemed dispensationalism was losing steam, along came Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins to breathe new life into the movement with the apocalyptic novel Left Behind. That book and the remainder of the series is based upon the dispensationalist system of eschatology developed in the 19th century and made the standard for fundamentalism in the 20th. That there is little scriptural or historical support does not seem to phase its adherents in the least. They merely read their own meanings into passages by imposing a systematic superstructure upon the prophetic verses of Scripture and map their imagined meanings onto the texts. This artificial system is made to fit - often in a forced manner - no matter how square the pegs and how round the holes.  Yet before LaHaye came up with the idea for Left Behind, he also wrote books detailing the system he supported in a more conventional manner. One of the more important to gain an understanding of LaHaye's eschatological views is his commentary on the Book of Revelation, Revelation Unveiled. Here we see the system that guides his novels without the ability to hide behind claims of literary license. What emerges is a parochial, nationalistic, and bigoted vision in which God seems to save the most vital outpourings of the Holy Spirit for White Anglo-Saxon Protestants living in the southern United States.   Needless to say, LaHaye would take issue with that claim but this is primarily because he fails to recognize the flaws and biases of the ingrained assumptions that are intrinsic to the fundamentalist subculture that has formed the backdrop of his theological upbringing. Part of this is a virulent anti-Catholicism that manifests itself in opposition to much of what is historic Christianity in favor of an individualistic and uniquely Ameican distortion of the faith. He time and again peddles views that are part of the American ethos as essential to Christianity and holds what happens to his subculture and their ancestors as determining the health of the Church.  This parochialism is seen early in his interpretation of the seven churches as outlining periods of Church history with the most negative saved for the medieval and contemporary church and the most positive saved for his idealized period of Evangelicalism. Besides the obvious fact that there is no justification in the text or history for such an interpretation, there is the clear problem that he sees everything from the eyes of a modernist American. The so-called "Dark Ages" were a completely Western phenomenon and even then it recovered when peace was restored. In the Eastern half of the Roman Empire, the Byzantines carried on the great patristic tradition and in the lands east of the old empire, the Church of the East would engage in one of the most remarkable evangelistic outreaches in history. In the ideal Evangelical age of LaHaye's imagination, Christianity was in almost complete decline as the views of secularism took hold of Europe and much of America. In the contemporary era when things are supposed to be collapsing, Asia and Africa are seeing conversions to the faith that dwarf any evangelistic outreach in history. It is quite obvious LaHaye judges the success of the Church by the success of that part of the Church through which he can trace his lineage.   Things do not get much better in later chapters as LaHaye uses all manner of logical gymnastics to attempt to make the Scriptural passages fit into the dispensationalist system. All he seems to do is perform verbal sleight-of-hand and, when he cannot overcome the obvious difficulties, resort to ad hominem attacks on his opponents. Again and again he constructs artificial and completely shallow arguments for the rapture but never explains why there is no passage in Scripture that states Christ will come back twice. It is merely the system that imposes the idea and the necessity of the system that divides passages into "rapture" and "second coming" classes. Amid the charts and graphs is the undeniable fact that this system is a modern construction that would not have been recognized by any Christian living in the first millennia and a half of the Church's existence.  Not that this is an issue for most dispensationalists. There is a great irony that these alleged rebels against modernism are thoroughly modernistic in their approach to Holy Scripture. History means nothing to them as they revel in their "new discoveries" that could not have been known "until now." Just as all the Christians throughout history must step aside to their superior understanding, even the world itself must end because they have arrived to usher in the last days. They have taken the modernist idea of progress and internalized it as a facet of the Christian faith. The belief that modern Evangelicals will unite with Jews to usher in the end of all things (of course, the Evangelicals get whisked away while the Jews are left behind to face slaughter) becomes an apocalyptic version of the American ideal of manifest destiny. Nineteenth century modernism lies at the heart of twenty-first century fundamentalism.  The crudeness of LaHaye's anti-Catholicism is not as subtly displayed as in his fictional Left Behind series. Here he makes overt attacks and draws heavily upon Lorraine Boettner's Roman Catholicism as a source for his views. Boettner's work has long been recognized as horribly biased and inaccurate and has been a sourcebook for anti-Catholic bigots for decades.   His crude biases apply no less to those with non-dispensationalist views than to those from other ecclesial traditions. He constantly harps on the fact that dispensationalists take a "literal" reading but this is clearly not the case. In a book laden with symbolism, the symbolic interpretation is the literal reading. In fact, LaHaye gets it all backwards! In his interpreation of the first three chapters that are not part of John's vison and are clearly messages to seven churches in first century Asia Minor, he reads them as symbolic of Church history. But in the later chapters that are part of John's apocalyptic vision and obviously drenched in symbolism, he complains because others seek to understand the symbols in their proper context. Here, LaHaye and other dispensationalists go wild trying in bizzarre attempts to match these symbols to "literal" modern weaponry. It never occurs to them that such prophetic visions in the Holy Scriptures are never analagous to a video playback but are given in symbols that need interpreting.  A glance at the bibliography given in the book is evidence enough of his insulation within the fundamentalist mindset. The books cited are largely from his own fundamentalist camp and reinforce his own biases. He makes no attempt to understand those with different views in their own words but merely parrots attacks from other authors who share the views of his subculture. Even the few that do not fall into this category are outdated works that do not reflect contemporary standards of scholarship.   Revelation Unveiled is a textbook case that exposes the truly unsavory backdrop that underlies the worldview of fundamentalism. It takes much of the worldview of 19th century Anglo-Americanism and seeks to apply it as a foundation for the Christian faith. Dispensationalism is thus merely an outgrowth of that view applied to escahtology. If there were any doubt, LaHaye unwittingly asserts just how culturally biased that view has become. Even among dispensationalist commentaries on the Book of Revelation, it attempts new lows. It is the "ugly American" of eschatological commentaries and should give pause to any reader of the Left Behind series who does not share its underlying biases. 
 Has anyone noticed how Chopin has copied Michael Nyman's score for The Piano in his Piano Sonata No.3 in B minor, Op.58, Largo? Someone had better tell Nyman 
 In 1983/1984 Quiet Riot's Metal Health was the first "metal" album to hit #1 on the billboard charts. So in the 1980's this album was huge "Cum on Feel the Noize"(a Slade cover)was the big single, as well as "Metal Health". Those two songs are pretty good as well as "Don't Wanna Let You Go" but after that Metal Health pretty much is a downhill slide, it gets worse the longer it plays. These days Quiet Riot has a greatest hits album so there is really no reason for anyone who doesn't have this album to buy it, believe me with the greatest hits you're getting all the good songs from the album 
 Nothing new here.  Same ideas presented in a very uninteresting fashion.  This book neither motivated me, nor did it teach me a thing about fat loss.   Jim should read some of the other books that have been published since.  The "3 Hour-Diet" by Jorge Cruise and "Five Factor Fitness" by Harley Pasternak are significantly better 
 One word to summarize the whole production: pathetic. The script, the action, the actors are laughable. On top of that it is historically incorrect, just like other movies recently. The duels and fighting scenes are ridiculous. Surprised by Angus Macfadyen taking part in this clown show (he must be broke).  Do yourself a favor and skip it 
 The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand 
 A lot of repeat shots, half shots and bad angle shots. Would have like to see more full frontal shots. Found it uninteresting and dull 
 Somebody call Queens of the Stone Age and tell them that Death From Above stole their equipment ... and their licks. Is there room for another QOTSA? Probably. What I'm wondering is why this isn't found all over cheeseball commercial radio stations. But then, this isn't quite the adolescent, swoon-inducing caterwaul of, say, sickly sweet dollboys Fall Out Boy or the faux-heavy attention-spanless swill of mascara-dowsed cherubs Hawthorne Heights. Death From Above, while not at all mind-expanding, truly is heavy and heavy is not light, and light is bright and bright light breeds happy thoughts and happy thoughts are a preteen girl's wet dream. So, while it's a perfect match for formaldehyde-smoking jocks and tuba-sized bong-owning dropouts, it doesn't quite fly with the doll-collecting crowd. And who knows, I haven't seen what the band members look like; maybe they all have buckteeth, receding hairlines and crossed eyes and that's why they didn't get a TRL invite. 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 Typical O'Rourke drivel. Heres how it goes.  PJ gets Rolling Stone to pay to send him to Lebanon, Panama (circa Noriega) and some other places where they have lots of guns and bad manners and little of anything else, in the hopes that he will get drunk enough to wander out from the hotel bar, see some "bad stuff" and come up with something funny to say about it. His humor is pointed and well placed at times. Most of the time though he, merely, uses the humor to set up some libertarian screed. Heavy reliance on Cato institute,intern-toadies(who fact check, research and do the academic heavy lifting) at times gives O'Rourke the appearance of knowing his arse from a hole in the ground....do not be fooled. PJ is a Hunter Thompson wannabe, but who lacks HT'S gonads. SKIP IT 
 To echo one of the other reviewers, exact placement of the wrist rest is near impossible.  Two days after I thought I had done it perfectly, a bubble appeared.  I tried pressing it out, but within a matter of hours the bubble back.  So, I decided to remove the wrist rest. To my disgust, the adhesive had (in the space of a few days!) begin to cling tighter to my laptop than the pad.  It took me about hour to get the last of the gummy adhesive off.  Avoid the wrist rest 
 Terrible results. Scan line interference. Looked like steady stream of waves 
 Ok, I had really high expectations for this film, thinking it was going to document the Kubh Mela, but it doesn't really.  This film does give a over view of the festival but it really documents a few westerners being lead around by a painfully goofy "swami".  The makers of this film really stuck to alot of the over the top antics that can be found on the surface of such a gathering.  Again, if this was a in debth documentry of the festival it would have been much better.   The true high lights of this film are H.H. The Dalai Lama as well as the bonus interviews with the featured teachers that are minutely woven through out this film.  If you buy this (or rent it) don't miss the bonus stuff at the end, its basic dharma stuff which could have been much better if the interviewer knew what they were doing but  a few of the interviews are really wonderful if just to see the love and open hearts of a few great teachers 
 Don't bother buying 'the wonder of girls,borrow it from a friend cause it will only make a turn around the office with many a snicker.I couldn't think of a girl I grew up with including myself who needed constant reassurance or had more  trouble with math than boys.I agree with the other review about we grow our own brains and make connections.Infact,research  shows if you give any child a chance at spatial tasks,the child improves.Girls often are given dolls .,so how can a girl  develope spatial ability playing with a doll? Go fig!Gurian  doesn't tell the reader anything about experience and environment ~ instead he is vocal about fixed brain function which of course leaves a child in a narrow subgroup.Girls are all lumped into one.I wouldn't let your daughter read this book,'it might give her a bad case of low self~esteem and leave her wondering about herself as a woman.Gurian wants women in  second place at best.Teach your daughter to believe in herself not some pop psychology from a questionable author bent on messing with her success 
 If you are a 14 year old raver this cd is great and I highly recommend it. If not, dont waste your money, or time looking for that "one good track", because its not there 
 I bought this CD during a visit to J-town in San Francisco last year and I was shocked at how un-listenable  the CD was, I think I only liked two of the tracks. The mix overall is very uneven, I wouldn't consider this as a fair sampling of available jpop,  this is an unfortunate rubbish tip packaged for quick sale to the poor soul looking to explore a rich and fun musical vein 
 As the reviewer below mentioned, this device neither shaves nor removes the hair around the bikini area, but instead seems to trim it down to a small point. This is ok if all you want is to not have long hairs creeping around, but I was expecting a much smoother result, and this thing doesn't cut it! I have very dark hair, and it was still visible after trimming, plus it hardly seemed to touch thicker hairs! Where this does work quite well is on my upper thighs, where the hair is lighter and finer, but I have other things to remove hair there! All-in-all, I'm disappointed by this device and wouldn't recommend it in place of waxing, epilating, or just plain shaving 
 I have read all of J. Kellerman's books and always found them fascinating..this one is just confusing.  Too many characters with way too much "conversation" with each.  One gets confused as to which one is which and why they are a concern to the case of the confession.  By the time you are half way through, you don't really care who died, you just want the story to get finished. Alex seems to be sort of the "outside looking in" and observing all this.  Thank goodness Milo is still Milo.  The Robin character is in need of some sort of mental therapy help herself and it seems peculiar that Alex would bother with her. 
 If the demented 13-year-old offspring of the unholy union between David Lynch and William S. Burroughs were given pen and paper and told to write a trippy story splattered (and I don't choose that word lightly) with blood, gore, zombies and sex, Baby Jesus Butt Plug is what you'd get.  Unfortunately the outcome will still suffer from the story telling of a hormone laden 13-year-old boy.  To illustrate, imagine a depraved pre-pube making up a wild sex-fi story on the fly, while his wide-eyed buddies eat up his every absurd word.  It's stream-of-consciousness story telling with all manner of shock and awe thrown in for effect.  On the other hand, the beginning and end of the story contain flashes of satirical brilliance, biting humor and quirky sci-fi-esque fun to offset the crude writing and story line.  One passage that I found particularly clever and amusing is when the narrator talks of getting a free Baby Jesus Butt Plug from a couple who just want to make sure the BJBP goes to a good home.  He says, "And when they said `a good home' all they really meant was they didn't want to give them to anyone who would stick them in their butts".  I wish Mellick had pursued the socio-religious angle of owning a BJBP that began to take form in the first third of the book.  Or he could have explored the conundrum of losing oneself physically and mentally in a sea of one's own clones.  Either way would have made for a much more powerful and coherent statement.  As it stands, the story begins to provoke and stimulate but quickly deteriorates into a menage-a-bizarre story of teen male angst, desire and fear.  I've read other Mellick works and know that in a lengthier format he can make you blush, throw-up and ponder in the matter of one short paragraph.  So I am comfortable in saying that this is not his best.  However, if you want a unique insight into the stuff of which adolescent boys wet dreams are made, then Baby Jesus Butt Plug will take you there. 
 I just had to put this one down!  This was one useless book in my opinion.  I purchase it for its alleged value to the business person.  I just didn't get how the content was applicable to selling to the aging or where the  author came up with some of his ideas.  I would be inclined to agree with  the readers from California.  This was one dry and pointless piece of  fiction 
 I bought this book in preparation for my first trip to Thailand.  I was hoping for a readable overview of Thailand's history to enhance my stay.  Unfortunately, I came away less than satisfied with Wyatt's book.  It was long and tedious.  His writing style is pedantic and dull.  The author clearly knows his subject well, but his treatment of Thai history was long on details, presented chronologically, but short on interpretation.  Surprisingly, there was little in the book about how Buddhism affected the course of historical events.  After finishing the book as the plane touched down in Bangkok, I had assimilated a number of important facts about Thailand, but I didn't feel that the book gave me the chance to understand the sweep of Thai history.  Yet, my research did not find any other book in English which covers the subject.  Until one comes along, hopefully a better one, I guess this is it 
 This book has some interesting stuff in it but the style is terrible. There are loads of unbelievably bad metaphors and plenty of trashy sensationalism. Still, if you want to find out about a bit more about one  of the greatest bands around then give it a try 
 After seening and reviewing Fahrenhyte 9/11, I chanced upon this film and watched it.  It is deceiving and insubstantial.  As the #1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction, including most of the important books about national security, 9/11, oil, and terrorism, I have to state there are exactly TWO points of truth in this shallow stupid little film:   1) the photo of Bush reading a book upside down was a fabrication, Bush was actually listening.  2) Clinton blew it.  Correct. Madeline Albright will go down in history for refusing to let her staff report terrorism honestly, and Tony Lake will go down in history for failing to get it right.  It bears mention that then Commandant of the Marine Corps Al Gray did get it right, in his article "Global Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's" published in the fall of 1988, but no one wanted to listen.  I am impressed by the teacher of color who was in charge of the classroom that day, recounting how she felt Bush was truly presidential, and wise not to add to the panic by rushing out of the room.  Absolutely.  Good point.  The rest of this extreme rightist propaganda tract is totally disconnected from reality and the truth.  The movie claims that Gore lost because of Nader, and completely ignores the hard documented proof that the Florida leeadership acted to disenfranchise over 35,000 people of color, one reason that the Bush family was so confident, in advance, of victory in  Florida.  This trashy film fails to address the many angry Representatives and the inert Senate, including Gore, who failed to use the power of Congress to redress the impeachable wrong done to America in 2000 (and again, this time in Ohio, in 2004).  Anything that features snap-shots of Ann Coulter is very likely to be loosely related to the truth, reality, or the public interest.  I am glad I watched this film, because it reconfirms my gravest fears--the extreme right in America now has a propaganda machine more powerful that Hitler's, and a brainwashed following more lethal than the Hilter Youth.  This is seriously troubing stuff.  I gave Moore four stars, one star down for being too glib by half.  That's an honest assessment.  This shallow little movie gets two stars, and both of those are for reflecting what is in the small minds of the nutty right 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way. 
 If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one 
 this is the scariest movie ever made I got so freaked out. the ring was boring not scary. i hate real scary. 1' 2' 3 '4' 5 '6 what happins when you count to 6 to defeat the boogeyman you don't fear him! I thought it was scary when his dad gets killed by the boogeyman.  this movie is about fear and fearing the boogeyman 
 If you have read "Reunion" or "Einstein's Dreams", you'll be quite upset with this novel.    It seems rather limited in its scope, and is lacking metaphor like Lightman's other works.  He has developed as a writer since this book, however.  Don't let this one discourage you from exploring his other wonderful novels.  
 My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO.  I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it. 
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 I loved the movie; I hate the CD. Sadly, the music without the movie just doesn't cut it. Some of the songs don't even sound the same and there are some extra songs added in. I have wanted to order this CD forever and finally got around to doing it recently. I just lisetened to it for the first and last time. It will go out at my next garage sale. What a waste of money.  
 The book was supposed to be a translation, but the author has ended up publishing her biases in the garb of presenting it in narrative form. A quick search on the author reveals that she is a controversial character and that Encarta removed her contribution after investigating her scholarship.   As someone interested in learning about Hinduism, I was looking for someone who could just give me the facts instead of a polemicist. The book was a huge disappointment. I wish I had known about Encarta yanking her piece on the grounds of poor scholarship before I embarked on reading her "translation. 
 I read this book beacuse of all the good reviews. But I ended up being very disappointed. As a Filipina, I feel that this book gives a very negative portrayal of the people in the Philippines. I don't recommend this book at all. 
 We were so disappointed with this book that we returned it.  For the price, it's a very thin book -  only 30 pages.  For preparing a child for a trip to Italy, the illustrations were especially disppointing.  Only a few offered images of what might be seen in Italy.  Most of the others were generic illustrations that  could have been  set anywhere, such as a child and his stuffed bear eating a pizza, the circle of a flashlight beam on the pavement 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 The features on this toy are cute, just not planned out very well.  My boys love the music and bubbles, but the micky and goofy that go up and down on the sides broke off after a couple days.  The voice recorder is very hard to work because of a short cord. For a ride on my boyslike the radiio flyer retro rocket more.  Overall, in our house this is a bubble machine.  
 I had the exact same experience as Stan, another reviewer. I bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off, I could not get it started again. Like Stan, I thought it was a fluke and bought another. Same problem, two days after buying the pad. I have looked in four stores in the Seattle area and cannot find another brand of heating pad. This one should not be on the market. I am sending both pads back to the manufacturer 
 After several hours of telephone support conversation, Belkin told me that there was simply too much interference in my apartment to allow for a connection between my Belkin Router my Belkin wireless notebook card. Mind you, I live in a one-bedroom apartment in Queens, and the distance between the router and the notebook is no more than 40 feet. On top of that, I don't have any cordless phone. So there I went and bought a range extender to place between the router and my laptop. Since then, I have spent several hours of technical support ON A WEEKLY BASIS, because the way they tell me to configure the connections and the wireless bridge just doesn't work! Oh, how I wish I had just bought a very long internet cord instead... 
 HART'S WAR had potential. The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI's crammed into an overcrowded POW compound.  If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.    Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER'S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.    In the story Colin Farrell's character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator's defense during the subsequent courts martial.    If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.  Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart's unexplained behavior, an mass tunnel escape plot, sabotage and the German Commandant's attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage.  HART'S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic, no doubt to cut costs.   A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office.  Still, if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection 
 I played this CD and was not happy.  I had to return the item becasue it skipped really bad on almost every song 
 I have heard many speak highly of the book, but I just don't get it. There is passion in his style and his delivery encouraging teachers to maintain integrity, to stay true to themselves, and so forth. I guess that I lose interest due to the verbose language used. There are many aspects to teaching, and it is a lot of work; I am not equating this aspect to success or failure for connection with the students. As I said, many that I have spoken to enjoy it... I don't 
 Zone 5 is not cold climate gardening! Book is a waste for those who truly live in cold climates 
 This book has contents that speculate with the bible concept of money, and has subliminal christian messages for teens.Is a teen brainwasher, intercalating financial advise with christian believes.This is a religious book 
 Buyer beware: this program will critically impair your system!  Internet loading will be drastically crippled.  Expect frequent system choppiness due to automatic downloading and background processes.  There is NO WAY to close McAfee to get around these drawbacks other than to uninstall.  I am going to return this first thing next week.  I gave them a few weeks to improve performance with patches and upgrades, but nothing has changed.  If only I had read the reviews ahead of time.   Bottomline: if you don't mind these side-effects, by all means purchase this program;  McAfee has solid protection.  But there are easier ways to get that protection 
 I am interested in quick, easy salads, but these were too complicated for a novice cook such as myself.  And after a long day at work in the emergency room of a major city hospital, I don't have time for the exacting  and time consuming prep work.  I cook to relieve stress, not add to my own.   Even the dull quality of the photographs, didn't enhance my desire to make  any of the salads.  I have the chef's cookie AND chocolate book and were  were PLEASED with those, thats why I purchased the salad book,  unfortuneatly, I was very disappointed. Maybe I'm just a baker at heart.    I guess I'll stick to chocolate as a major food group 
 This text is horable, there is info that is wrong. I am ST student . I would buy Alexdars it's the best book around 
 If you've read her Amanda Quick novels, this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel, "Scandal".  Heroine proposes to hero, who has a hidden agenda. Of course he's rich and he has almost the same history as "Scandal", whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w/ the debt, and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father's friends/business associates want paid right away.  Of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up. But his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path.  The book is so similar that a couple of times I caught myself looking at the cover to make sure I had the right book. The only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time 
 Unless you are a first timer to the area this book will tell you very little.  While the information regarding the area (complete with maps) can be helpful the information on new restaurants and hotels is non existant.  (I notice they didn't list many resorts including the well known Palace properties).  This can help you with local things but use some other source for where to stay/eat. I also found the web had more information then this book did.  The only difference I can see with this book was that they added "great websites".  Which really consist of about five very generalized sites.  If you want an overall view it is fine.  If you want detailed info (where to eat, where to stay) I would suggest another publication 
 Pace was ploddingly slow through the first 14 chapters. Characters weren't engaging enough to warrant finishing this book 
 Yeah, so Blanchett's character plants a bomb to kill a drug dealer. Where would an English teacher get a bomb in Italy, in a Boms-R-Us store? And why did not she simply unleash a Godzila on that bad guy? Then she faints and falls in love with a guy who has as much appeal as my supersonic toothbrush. And that's Cate Blanchett for you guys. Rejoice already. Then they shave their heads - a masterful plan to blend with Italian peasantry crowds. Great. Now what do you do when your shaving heads plan thing does not work? Jump on a helicopter and end the movie. I don't know... Sounds kind of stupid. Is it me or the movie 
 It was very much anticipated after the success of "Westworld" that this movie would be just as good as the original.  Sorry to say that it doesn't do any good!  Yul Brenner is only in this movie for about 2 minutes, and that's in a dream sequence!!  Don't waste your time on purchasing or watching this retread!  It's a waste of time and money! 
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 This would have to be the worst book I have ever read. I bought it based on the brilliant reviews it had received on Amazon, however it was a very disappointing read. The characters were poorly developed and quite one dimensional. The main character and her outlook on the world was pathetic. It was so bad that I couldn't bear reading the last few chapters and instead threw the book in the bin.  I am an avid reader of chicklit and especially love authors like Sophie Kinsella and Maggie Alderson. These books are cleaverly writen and keep you turning the pages. Unfortunately this book couldn't even keep my interest to the end.  A total waste of time, let a lone make up 
 The material is fine. They cover most of the basics. However, I found the book to be extremely repetitious. They would often say the same thing over and over, page after page. It was comical really. The book could easily have been edited down to half its size.  The construction of the book lacked any organization at all. I got the feeling that the many topics in it were written at different times and slapped together when it was time to put it together for publishing. You could just as easily read it from back to front because there really is no flow to the book.  I also had a problem with this Abraham thing. It was kind of a turnoff really. I understand it's a nice marketing angle, but enough already. I hope no one out there really believes that this info came from some supernatural entity. It's too bad, really; the writers seem knowledgable enough to have written on this subject without the need for a gimmick. 
 The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes 
 Attached to 21" widescreen LCD and liked it at first glance.  Really like the components and feel of hardware, feels very sturdy.      However, after using for a couple days, I have found several flaws:   - Lag bolts are not strong.   I had to move from my original location and one of two lag heads stripped. - Screen not level in all positions.   Weight of LCD caused the screen to fall out of level when moved to the right and slightly when moved to the left.  This could be corrected by a rotate hing, but none exists. - Locks on arm don't provide appropriate locking tension.  The leveling issue is the most impacting and really makes this monitor arm useless in some positions.  I am returning this arm and ordering a similar product (premier AM2) and will compare features. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 I doubt if this random presentation of tones and sounds has any technical basis behind it.  It certainly did nothing for me.  Wasted money as far as I am concerned.  
 When purchasing this book it implied it was the actually text.  There was no picture of the book, so I ordered it.  This is a supplement to the text titled CRAM 101.  It has blank areas for notes and definitions.  It is not even a true study guide.  
 I had never seen Queen of the Damned until last night, when I had just finished Anne Rice's novel Queen of the Damned.  Knowing I would soon be done with the novel, I was curious to see the movie so I went out to MovieStop and picked up a cheap, used dvd copy, despite hearing that this movie was very bad.  Turns out, the word bad is an understatement.  Let me get to the point, there were several changes in the story, and I understand that some of this needs to be done in the movies for screen time reasons, etc.  But I found that after reading the novel, while the basic premise of the story is the same as in the novel, pretty much everything that gave the novel's plotline it's depth and intrigue was removed from the story in the film adaptation, and this movie simply falls flat.  I was shaking my head by the end of the movie with such disappointment that so much of the story was hacked away.  The vampires in this movie are not portrayed with the amount of love & feeling that is intended by Anne Rice, Akasha included.  Maharet, perhaps the foremost character in the novel, basically doesn't show up until the end of the movie simply to take part in a disappointing final showdown.  Again, all of the backstory that should have been present here was missing.  I won't spoil it for any of those who still plan to read the novel, but Akasha's motives for what she was planning to do were actually logical (in her own evil and misguided way), but there was a reason for it that she saw as legitemate, where as in the movie it was simply "everybody must die!".  Period.  That's your motive for everything that the movie was building up to.  I can't stress this enough - the depth of the book is GONE in the movie.  Like I said, I understand that things need to be trimmed/skipped for the sake of screen time, etc., but this movie was barely over 1 1/2 hours long, and so much of the plot development could still have been included here to give this movie the depth that it lacked.  What's wrong with adding even another 30-45 minutes of screen time to fill in the story and make it a 120 or 135 minute film?  Heck, I sat in the theatres for all three Lord of the Rings movies which all ran over 3 hours.  Or was this movie directed at punk kids with 10 minute attention spans, rather than the fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles?  Such a shame, because this movie really had the potential to equal, if not better, the adaptation of Interview With the Vampire.  I could go on and on about the other things that were done in this movie that I thought were just stupid, silly, etc. etc.  Kind of like how the other vampires were pissed at Lestat for revealing himself to the world as a vampire and giving away vampiric secrets, yet they decide to fly up on stage during the middle of the concert, in front of tens of thousands of people and start fighting, in essence "revealing" themselves as well, which is totally inconsistent with why these vampires were angry in the first place.  I won't go into all of the details, because it would take too much writing to tell you everything that bugged me.  Bottom line, I guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks with a Korn, etc. movie score, then you may still see some value here, but Anne Rice diehards will most certainly find this movie a waste of their time.  But don't let this movie scare you out of reading the novel, because the book is much much MUCH better than this movie 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money. 
 I picked up this book thinking I was going to get great inside dope on the secret service and a compelling plot. While Costello certainly includes some great nuggets here and there, overall he's more concerned about trivial, everyday occurances that don't advance the story. By the end of the book, I was left with a big "is that it?" feeling. Skip it or borrow it 
 Why of course the Chinese government was entirely to blame for the opium imported by the Scotsmen Jardine and Matheson!  It just like when Americans have a cocaine problem, it is the US government, and not the drug smugglers and dealers, that has the responsibility.  And if the Chinese folks got addicted to this narcotic, well, it's for their own good you know.  At least that's Herman's view.  Also, the Scots who thus created Hong Kong for the opium trade did not do all this hard work for money or for themselves.  Yes, they did make a little money but that's not why they were in China.  They imported opium in order to create Hong Kong so that one day it will become a "premier" commercial city of the Orient, with the ultimate goal of teaching China western financial and economic techniques.  If it were not for Jardine and Matheson, how could China have become a great power today, or a candidate superpower tomorrow?  No, these two far-sighted Scots had this noble, lofty goal in mind when they came to China, nothing lesss.  When historians condemn these two for their "crime" (drug-dealing, that is) they forget that they are actually heroes, as Herman sees so clearly and correctly.  And so it is completely unjust that a brilliant people like the Scots don't even have a country they can call their own while the "barbaric" and "decadent" Chinese do 
 I never received the large bowls. The small cereal bowls were sent twice (quickly but wrong size both times) and I returned both orders. I was sent an e-mail stating something significant was wrong with the system and I would not be receiving the larger bowls. Then I got an e-mail saying I was being billed for them to which I replied what I received was NOT what I ordered and had been returned twice. I have all the paperwork on both orders. The plates I ordered were never received at all. I have NO idea what is going on now. It makes sense that I be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that isn't happening eithe 
 I approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions. I did my best to like it, to find some secret meaning, some redeeming quality within, to no avail. Actually finishing the book was an accomplishment, in my opinion. Ultimately I found the book aimless, soulless, and the promoter of everything negative about the human species. I know this sounds harsh, but time after time I felt let down by On the Road.  No, I don't "dig" it, Dean 
 In his book, The Rebirth of Nature: The Greening of Science and God, Rupert Sheldrake proposes some ideas about nature, the planet earth and the universe which at first look, sound interesting, but upon closer examination may seem somewhat far fetched. Many of his ideas are rooted in spiritual concepts, yet he also discusses science, its characteristics and its history.  Sheldrake attempts to link scientific concepts to his ideas, while at the same time showing disdain for the scientific way of thinking, which he terms "close minded." His ideas of "morphic fields" and "formative causation" are presented without  convincing evidence. At best he offers anecdotes to support his claims, which include: the idea that animals can communicate telepathically across time and space, and that crystals  influence each other through "morphic resonance." Reasonable people who have some knowledge of science will likely see there are less magical explanations for the phenomenon he discusses.  At the same time Sheldrake scolds the reader as "mystery intolerant" if unwilling to accept the author's assertions.  Sheldrake has purposely tried to blend science, which works through well thought out experiments to lead to the development of theories, and mysticism, which allows for leaps of faith to reach beliefs.  Some may find this combination refreshing, while others might view the juxtaposition of these two methods of understanding, as intrinsically incompatible.  Sheldrake's end goal seems to be to convince the reader of the great value of planet earth, and the importance of living in harmony with our environment.  Indeed, this concept is crucial to the future of humanity and all life.  Yet many will not need Sheldrake's extraordinary theories to lead to the recognition of this great truth 
 First, an observation.  This book starts out explaining what a screwdriver is, and proceeds to attempt to explain complex repairs such as servicing the distributor.  If you really don't know what a screwdriver is, this book can't help you.  And if you attempt to service the ignition system because you read this book, you will need real help, and possibly hospitalization.  The book explains in great detail outmoded automotive technology.  Anybody driving a car with drum breaks and carburetor needs a job, not a how-to book.    The book is liberally infested with cut-away line drawings of various car systems.  Most are confusing, none are explained well.  The book is chock full of esoteric details, but lacks coherent explanation.  This is the way engineers generally write (I speak from experience here).  As it turns out, the author has zero technical credentials, yet she claims sole authorship.  Could be.  All in all, one of the worst books it has ever been my misfortune to purchase. 
 This had to be the dryest, dullest novel that I have ever read.  The characters are very unrealistic and difficult to relate to.  Although the idea of the civil rights movement is important, this novel portrays this subject in the dry manner.  For anyone looking to be bored out of their minds this summer, pick up this book.  For anyone who wants a good read, select any other title at random--it has to be better that this one 
 Tsukiyama knows hwo to write beautifully, BUT her metaphors and poeticisms feel too contrived. This novel is for lonely, flighty housewives. If you enjoy daytime soaps and/or exoticized perversions of the Asian culture, you'll love Dreaming Water 
 This is a warning.  This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator.  The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted.   There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it.   I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation.  It is a wonderful play, but this edition should be taken off the market 
     Earth,Wind & Fire's first greatest hits album is so musically well constructed it's almost worth those who own the albums already to have it.The same isn't true with this one-tune's like "Love's Holiday","Serpentine Fire","Mighty Mighty" and "Boogie Wonderland" are classics but the overall album doesn't flow together half as well as the first.The juxtaposition of era's is jarring too-the production and style of some of the songs have too much of a range and makes it seem well....dated in parts.Better to purchase the chronological and extensive 'Eternal Dance' box set-it has ALL the hits in the proper order and is frankly better mastered 
 I highly admire the work of Dr. Paul Lam through Tai Chi, but was extremely disappointed that the review says you CAN listen to a sample, yet no samples are available.   Would you be able to correct this error, please 
 Bruce Bawer, Daniel Pipes, Ibn Warraq, and others, have covered the important points with much greater skill and clarity.  And yes, there are important points: the threat of Islamist imperialism is real; the traditional Left's failure to grasp this has had catastrophic results; Eurotrash anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments are irrational and hypocritical; etc.  Beyond this, Berlinski is so pickled in Republican broth that she cannot stop undermining her own positions.  1. She complains of the urban sprawl and degraded environment of Europe, but wishes Europeans would breed faster. 2. She enjoys the freedom that European secularism gives her (as a secularist of Jewish parentage) but whines that more 'old tyme religion' is needed to counter Islamism. 3. She attributes Marseilles' (relative) freedom from Muslim mob violence to the inclusion of religious councils in city government. But must report the selection of a archetypal fundamentalist imam by the Marseille ummah.  The book appears to have been padded out to its current length, several later chapters are seriously below standard.  For one toothachingly tedious chapter, Berlinski appears to have skimmed Norman Cohn's great work The Pursuit of the Millennium. She manages to miss Cohn's central point--that Medieval Millennialist uprisings were specific to their time and do not support comparisons with Lenin, Luther etc.--and mines the book for examples of anti-clerical/anti-feudal revolutionaries so that she may compare them to a contemporary anti-globalization/anti-American French demagogue.  In addition, we must slog through an entire chapter on the German heavy-metal band Rammstein, so that Berlinski can point out that ... ya know ... Germans are, like ... different. 
 The useful information in this book takes up about ten pages.  The book depicts women as unable to be happy or whole without a man to validate their very existence 
 If anyone can tell me where i can get the UNCUT versions of these films please email taylor5821@hotmail.com   Cheers   Mick  
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 The author spends nearly half the book with criticsm of performance measurement, a technique currently practiced by the vast majority of fortune 500 companies. He then sets up a "model" for assessing performance measurement techniques and uses this to "prove" that such techniques must fail, are totally useless and have adverse impacts on any organization deploying them. He then indicates that he alone knows what's best (apparently the rest of us are fools). Having poured scorn on his competition, he then puts forward the technique of Catalytic Coaching but of course fails to subject it to the same model that he used in his diatribe against performance measurement. The truth, as any management professional well knows, is that if you don't measure it, you can't manage it! Avoiding the issue does not resolve it. This book is unscientific nonsense dressed up in the language of science in order to deceive the reader.  
 Although not nearly as heinous as Richard Avedon's "In the American West", Stephen Shore's "Uncommon Places" earns an honored place in the annals of overrated art. Its sole interest is its time-capsule appeal.  Imagine if you will, taking a camera across America and shooting ugly buildings, roads, humble homes, and desolate scenery with nary a concern of cohesiveness or narrative. Make no attempt to include a theme, other than perhaps a New Yorker's condescension much like the lyrics in the Talking Heads song "The Big Country." You then have this book.   Perhaps 15-20 of these photgraphs hold some genuine magic. The rest are totally ridiculous. Much better is Eggleston's "Los Alamos."   Even the title is grating 
 A rather toothless attempt at rewriting Strunk and White, or Chicago into "fun." Reference books shouldn't waste this much space on casual conversation. Get to the point--get Elements of Style, Elements of Grammar, and Chicago rather than this handbook 
 After being an amature photographer via print film, I decided to try a digital camera - though I've been leary about printing quality.  I knew I couldn't afford a digital SLR, so I opted for a "snap shot" camera that I thought would have enough features to satisfy me.  However, after having and using this camera for a year now, I am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout.  After being used to print and picture quality in my film SLR (Cannon, I might add), I was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, I wish I would have just saved my money for a digital SLR.  
 This book was published in 1996, however, the information seems like it comes from 1986.  It is full of stereotypes and hacker rumors that any REAL hacker would laugh at.  It might be good if you want the info on search warrants, but computer hardware and software has changed so much that most of this book is irrelevant today 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 This is but a short "add-on" to Timothy Kearney's excellent review of this book.  I found The Writer's Guide to Character Traits merely another textbook formula for creating wooden people.  Stereotypical.  Gives you nothing that would enable you to maximize these traits--qualify them for  inclusive fitness into your story.  At best, this book is good for (occasional) checklist purposes only.  Far and away, in my opinion, the most USEFUL book on characterization is Karen Hood's Creating Character Emotions.  #####  Before buying this book I would recommend reading Timothy Kearney's review. Re-read it. Then read it again.       
 I did not find this book particularly good. I did read the entire books, but that at almost 400 pages it was far too long and slow without any benefit from its length. The central characters were somewhat intriguing.   What ruined the book for me were too many inclusions of 20th century slang  terms. Words like "creep" and "the Mob." were used  freely, but back then they would not have been part of the everyday world  view. I also had the mystery solved in the first few pages. I think if the  book was 200 pages and the mystery was less obvious, it would have been  easier to overlook the inclusion of slang.  I think Lynda S. Robinson does  a better job of writing historical mysteries. Her characters are  interesting to the modern reader without being imports from the modern  world 
 I was very excited to see another Valentine horror movie coming out; the last one I remember was My Bloody Valentine about some Cole Minor named Harry Nabob or something like that, very bad film.  But Valentine looked like it would be good and it was actually until the ending.   The pretty boy being the killer again is just played out.  Scream was good everything else is just redundant.  Imagine if the geeky boy who was attacked by the bullies actually got burned or his face was horribly deformed in a fall or something like that.  He goes to the mental institution and years later he escapes or is released into society, but escaped is much better.  This masked figure then chases down the mean kids and kills them one by one, then the climax when we see his face it shows the reason he is so angry and deranged.   I give it 2 stars because it could have been so good and I can always pretend the ending was good 
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 As the past reviewer I did not arrive to the page with THE END printed on it, and I really hate to be unable to finish a book. Anecdote aside, I am aware that my review lacks proper grounds, but since there is so much to  read and too little time, I strongly suggest you to look for other works of  this author. During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama  was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops  and all the events seem to be going nowhere. Besides the construction of  the language is boring and confusing. It feels like the author worked in  this novel for a while, then left it during some years locked in a closet  and one fine day decided to complete it, but without being at ease doing  so 
 As a fan of Acorn Media and a viewer of anything BBC that I can get my hands on, I have to say that I was disappointed by this production. Lovelace was far too villainous (every villain needs a redeeming quality). And the presentation of the "fake fire" followed by his complete recklessness seemed straight off the set of a high-school play.  I regret being this harsh, as I'm always rooting these programs to be first rate. But the performance turned up no redeeming characters for me -- save for Hermione Norris (whom I have worshipped ever since seeing Berkeley Square). Saskia Wickham's performance as Clarissa is without nuance, never truly tempted and predictably snappish throughout.   I walked away from the screen wishing Andrew Davies had writ the script 
 Many, many recipes in this book call for eggs, nuts, peanuts and milk.  My son is allergic to all these but CAN actually eat wheat just fine.  I thought this book would have lots of ideas on things I could feed my son.  But really it is a gluten-free cookbook which calls for his allergens and then says, "for egg allergies omit eggs", "for nut allergy omit nuts."  I could have just bought a gluten-free cookbook and omited eggs and nuts.  There would be no difference except that I wouldn't feel frustrated every time I read "omit nuts" and "use soy milk instead of milk" or whatever.    I think the title of this book should have been 'More than 150 recipes for the Celiac and wheat-allergic child which are low in sugar.'    The author has *NO* idea what it is to have a child with nut, egg and dairy allergies.  Also, many of the suggestions she gives and resources she listed are *NOT* OK for children with nut, egg and dairy allergies either.  Frustrating book!    However, I do think that it is probably an *excellent* cookbook if your child has Celiac or a wheat/barley/rye allergy so she gets 2 starts intead of just 1 
 Upon opening this book you find that it is not really a book but a giant catalog of drawings of archealogical pieces many of which have nothing to do with arms or armour.  Each has a brief description and if you wish to  see the line drawing of the item described you must continually flip to the  back of the book.  Besides these short descriptions, actual text amounts to  probably only 15 pages throughout the book. Not very informative overall 
 What I wanted was book that would help us figure out how to split up amicably and without a lot of stress. Instead, I got a lot of "go see a divorce lawyer." Someone in an earlier review said lawyer's love this book, I think that person's right. Guess tht's why so many lawyers review this book positively 
 The only thing exciting about the book is the title.  I could not wait to get the book and read it.  I can't remember being this disappointed in a book - ever.  There is nothing of any value in this - just warmed over hyperbole.  I am so po'd that I wasted money on this rip off 
       Mirowski's(M)book correctly points out that Samuelson's attempt to model economics "as if" it was the physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs fails to incorporate the  20th century physics of Einstein(the special theory of relativity(1904) and the general theory of relativity(1915)).However,if Samuelson had discovered the special nature of neoclassical economics,then he,and not John Maynard Keynes,would have been the greatest economist of the 20th century.Mirowski generally is correct that the economics profession has been too engrossed in the advanced Newtonian physics of the 1870-1900 time period.Of course,it is this type of physics that Samuelson was taught in his engineering physics courses when he was a student in the early 1930's(the same conclusion holds for this reviewer in the early 1970's).Unfortunately,Mirowski,instead of correctly pointing out that,despite Samuelson's great technical skills and ingenuity,such an approach could only yield special conclusions(Samuelson did point out that neoclassical theory is strictly limited to an analysis of points lying on the boundary of the static and dynamic production possibilities curves in his principles textbook),appears to come very close to claiming that Samuelson is a scientific fraud .Mirowski's claims are simply false. The second major problem with this book is in its assessment of Keynes's General Theory(GT;1936).Every statement about Keynes and the General Theory in this book is either an error of omission or an error of commission.Mirowski's knowledge of Keynes's mathematical modeling approach in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT is nonexistent.Mirowski's reliance on the error filled commentaries of the mathematically  and economically illiterate,inept,and innumerant accountant,Hugh Townshend,whom Mirowski describes as"...a spectacularly perceptive critic..."(Mirowski,p.411)means that he has absolutely no idea of what Keynes is doing.On pp.261-262 of the GT,Keynes gives,not once but twice,the sufficient macroscopic optimality condition required for there to be no involuntary unemployment.It is that the marginal propensity to spend must equal 1.Unless this condition is met,no amount of wage and price flexibility ,even if instantaneous and simultaneous in all markets,will have any effect.Formally ,the mpc must equal 1.If the capital stock is not at an optimal level,then the mpc+mpi=1=mpc+mps condition is required,where mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,mpi is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods,and mps is the marginal propensity to save.In chapters 20 and 21,Keynes derives this condition from the ground up,using a microfoundations of firms/industries operating under conditions of pure competition.This condition,which any competent mathematician can derive,is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where mpl is the aggregated marginal product of labor.If mpc+mpi<1,involuntary unemployment will automatically exist.Keynes demonstrated that the capitalist system is ,in fact, a system of multiple,stable equilibria.Due to the ignorance of Mirowski, concerning Keynes's Einsteinian revolution in economics,his explicit unsupported attack on P. Samuelson,and his implicit attack ,again unsupported,on John Maynard Keynes,I can't recommend the purchase of this book unless it undergoes a complete revision,concentrating on the deficiencies of modeling economics on late 19th century Newtonian physics only.Mirowski could have written a 5-star book.Instead,he mixs his correct assessment of the misguided attempts of the economics profession to model economics as if it were physics with a series of unsupported attacks on Samuelson and Keynes 
 A pharmaceutical representative recommended this book to me as I'm pursuing a job in this industry.  The author indicates that she worked first as a representative and later as a recruiter.  Her writing maintains the condescending attitude so prevalant among the people that work for these companies. Ms. Kerzic actually suggests that I should buy a good pair of shoes and a nice suit to interview in.  Is she kidding? In my industry you either wear the best suit and shoes that you can afford or you'll quickly be out of a job. Does she honestly believe a reader would show up wearing shorts and a tanktop? Other useful tidbits include phrases like, "don't waste my time". Sorry Ms. Kerzic, but if I decide to show up for an interview, apply for a job, or send you a resume',  it is OUR time.  Mine is just as important as yours.  She throws in a few hints on resume' building, but I've found much better formats that have resulted in interviews by consulting my local library. On the other hand, I will utilize some of her advice in writing my review of her book.  If you're considering buying this book, don't waste your time OR your money 
 My apologies to all the Hemingway fans, but I didn't really care for this book. I had a hard time understand what was going on throughout the book. One bright spot was when they were in the mountains fishing and it is always nice to read of another country that is not yours. The characters did not appeal to me, I wouldn't want to party with any of them. They seemed lost and spoiled. Grabbing a quick peek at the Cliff Notes in a book store for this book; I found some of my conclusions were valid. But unfortunately it just wasn't for me. If you try this book I wish you luck 
 1997-2003, the era of music we'd all like to forget. Limp Bizkit was adored by kids everywhere (and hated by more), Metallica went from Alternica to NUtallica and completely desecrated their 80's image with St.Anger, Emo begins polluting airwaves (my chemical romance, fall-out-boy). Now, we got this joke, ''Hitz''.     Limp Bizkit is a poser band and they cant and will never touch the likes of any 80's thrash heard on albums like: Kill Em' All, Master Of Puppets, Ride The Lightning (Metallica), The Dark (Metal Church), Bonded By Blood (Exodus), Beneath The Remains, Schizophrenia, ARISE (Sepultura)..and countless other classic thrash releases. Please, just avoid this turd. Forget this band or genre of music ever existed. 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 I was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review. It's lightweight but sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble, and very adjustable. I used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted, like a short tripod, and it was wonderful. It's also nicely finished, and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs, it stays together and doesn't flop around while you're toting it.   Unfortunately, that evening I had trouble docking our new Sony camcorder, and when I looked at the bottom of the camcorder, I saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera! To my great relief, I was able to pull out the pin with no trouble, but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes. I was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod, so this is not "consumer error." (I can't keep the quick-release plate permanently attached because then I can't dock the camcorder... bad on Sony there...but still.)   Your mileage may vary, but this tripod is going back to Amazon, and I'll be shopping for another brand. 
 Although the book may contain some very good information, the poor editing makes it hard for me to read. As a magazine editor, I probably notice these problems more than others, but I find them very distracting. I may change my rating once I've made it through the entire book, but as it is, I'm having trouble reading more than 2-3 pages at a time without putting the book down in annoyance 
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 After reading all the 5 star reviews for this book, I guess I was expecting more than what was delivered.  Most of what the author brings to light is not new.  There have been dozens if not hundreds of books describing out-of-body experiences, the Hall of Records, auras, the Astral plane, etc. This book does offer a slightly different perspective though, in that we experience these things through the eyes of a young girl.  Yet, when someone says that they have met with Jesus, it sets off my "b.s." meter.  What did Jesus have to say to the author?  Well, here again, nothing new.  He quoted from the Bible and He said things like "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness..".  And how does the 7 year old respond?  Like no 7 year old I have ever met. She kisses the feet of Jesus, at which time she hears "the angels singing about the blood of the lamb". Huh? How does the blood of the lamb fit in with astral travel? The author seems torn between her Baptist upbringing and her more unorthodox spiritual experiences.  The result is a confusing mix of beliefs that may leave readers scratching their heads 
 This Book was horrible!  I heard really great things about it and so i figured i should read it.  The main character is really boring and shallow and i didn't like her at all.  And for her to allow a boy to just take over her life even though she knows he doesn't love her is simply ridiculous!  I don't know i thought that this book was kind of boring and i just didn't like it that much.   
 Let me say right off that my 2-star review is for the series, not for this book alone.  This book, and the second book in the series, are both 5-star books.  They're tightly plotted, intricate, fast-moving, and impossible to put down.  Books 3 to 5, however, are one good book stretched out to fill three covers.  In each, I read on while wondering when something relevant was going to happen.  Meaningless subplots and irrelevant characters take over, and we are given hints of excitement to come before being bogged down in more subplots.  I must admit that I skimmed 300 pages of the fifth book, finding nothing relevant in them.  But the worst was yet to come.  Having built expectation for five books toward the ultimate confrontation between the main protagonist and the main antagonist, the authors betray their readers by denying them that confrontation in order to provide a reason for writing future books.  We are expected to be satisfied with the pair trading a few weak phrases before the series ends with a whimper.  I've rarely seen a series start with such promise, only to end in such disappointment 
 i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels.  it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it.  this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book.  it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle.  but the result is a less satisfying book.  it skims rather than digs deep 
 As others have mentioned, the alleged discrepancies between standard BB cosmology's predictions and astronomical observation are rather out of date. For exampled, since this book's publication, high resolution CMB data has revealed the predicted fluctuations.  Other reviewers complain that BB cosmology is no longer conceptually simple, and hold this as a great flaw. One even appealed to Occam's Razor! Perhaps an analogy will clarify this: the Copernican, heliocentric model was quite conceptually simple. It's only failing was a lack of predictive power -- in other words, it's predictions failed to match observation. Kepler and Newton came along later and made more accurate predictions about the orbits of the planets -- with a more complicated model. In the 20th century, Einstein's general theory of relativity (a *very* complicated way of looking at the world, compared to Newtonian mechanics) provided even more precise predictions that correctly accounted for the previously unexplainable "anomaly" of Mercury's orbit.  William of Occam laid forth the idea that when choosing between two theories *that give equally accurate predictions*, one generally prefers the simplest. The choice between Copernicus' theory and Kepler's Laws is not such a case -- Kepler's Laws made better predictions. The choice between Newtonian and Relativistic mechanics is not such a case -- Einstein's theory is more precise.  Just because a theory is complicated, doesn't mean it's wrong 
 Well, if you want to read the experience from academia, go right ahead. For a better insight, see Michael Beschloss or Ike's own biographer, Stephen Ambrose. This book was a hit in the scholastic arena but never  caught on in mainstrea 
 I am a big Percy Blakeney/Scarlet Pimpernel fan and have read Orczy's book at least 3 times.  Based on the strength of a customer review on this webpage, I purchased the boxed DVD edition, featuring Richard E. Grant & Elizabeth McGovern.  The scripts were written by Richard Carpenter.    I was VERY DISAPPOINTED by this screen version of the story.  I do NOT recommend it to any true Percy fan.  I have viewed 3 movie versions of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and this one is by far the worst.  Perhaps screen-writer Carpenter never read the book; perhaps he simply decided to take ENORMOUS LICENSE with the characters.  In either event, the script eliminated much of what was delightful about Orczy's Percy and turned Marguerite into a mild-mannered wimp without the wit or resources to save herself from her own stupid decisions.  Even worse, Marguerite was constantly in need of being rescued by her husband or, ironically, her former lover/the series villain, Chauvelin.  Here are some reasons for my conclusions:    Percy Blakeney, whom Orczy described in her book as the "master of disguise" never ONCE dons a disguise in this movie series (unless you consider wrapping a black scarf around the lower face a disguise).  And **HELLO!!** wouldn't the French be a tad bit suspicious of 3 black-cloaked, black-masked figures strutting around the streets of Paris in broad daylight?  (The French certainly arrested other characters for less!)  These scenes were so contrived, they were painful.  And yes, while it was certainly clever to have Percy escape ala James-Bond gadgetry -- this contrivance negated Orczy's portrayal of Percy as a man whose WIT was his first and primary weapon for defense and escape.  In fact, I found Percy (in this DVD collection) to be more fond of slicing and dicing enemies, than of using his unmatched cunning to save himself and his compatriots.  This twist on Percy was truly, truly disappointing -- the author must be turning in her grave.  As for the romance in Orczy's story...  Neither the actor nor the screen-writer were EVER able to convince me that Percy was the kind of man whom a woman (or a nation) could adore.  Richard E. Grant portrayed Percy as cold & verbally abusive to Marguerite.  Percy ridicules her publically several times -- and Marguerite's dialogue is written so that she never quite "gives" as good as she gets.    But Marguerite's dialogue is not the point.  THE POINT is that Percy, in the book, was a tormented man who loved a wife whome he feared he could not trust.  Never once did Grant's acting convey such breadth; his verbal sniping (as written and acted) was cruel and self-aggrandizing.  Even when Percy is supposed to be "play-acting" this ridicule of Marguerite in DVD #3 to set up a plot element later in the story, the contempt in the dialogue, as delivered by Grant, felt very REAL.  Screen-writer Carpenter's rendition of the so-called "romance" in this movie version touches the very uncomfortable theme of emotional abuse, especially through Grant's interpretation of the dialogue.  Rather than delivering his lines with subtlety (a nod to his hidden feelings of affection for his wife), Grant's Percy most often comes across as a high-handed male autocrat who expects Marguerite to submit meekly to his rule.  While this type of husband/wife relationship may have been historically accurate in 18th Century Britain, I do not believe that the Percy of Orczy's book would have handled himself in this way.  Indeed, Percy was supposed to be the consummate gentleman underneath all the frippery.  And he was supposed to be genuinely in love with his wife.  One of the rare, potentially romantic moments in DVD #1 was completely bungled by both leading actors.  Grant's one-liner about Marguerite being his "life" is delivered with such unbelievable dispassion that it borders on mockery.  (And please:  Marguerite's dimwitted mutterings about unrequited love at this crucial point in the plot -- when Percy is accusing her of complicity in a French family's murder -- was INSULTING to every woman of intelligence in the audience! I just wanted to throttle actress McGovern AND the screenwriter.)  Yes, yes, the original book hinged on this ongoing misunderstanding in the Blakeneys' marriage, but the dialogue could have been written and acted much better.  But if you don't consider the lack of plausible romantic elements a good reason to avoid this series, read on.  The problems with this verison of Orczy's Pimpernel go far beyond the love story.  For starters, Percy is often unsympathetic as a human being:  in addition to sniping at his wife and behaving in court like a smart-alecky prig, he shows a dearth of compassion at the death of his loyal lieutenant, Lord Anthony Dewhurst.  When Dewhurst is murdered by Chauvelin (in cold blood, I might add), Grant (and the scriptwriter) devote exactly 3 seconds to grief in DVD #1.  Grant cavalierly delivers the following dialogue: "Well, Tony knew the risks."  (And this Pimpernel is supposed to be a hero whom a nation adores?  Whom 20+ young British hotbloods would give up their LIVES for?! Sorry.  Didn't buy it.)  If Percy's casting was bad, Marguerite's was even worse.  In the book, Orczy's Marguerite was a flamboyant French actress, full of life and passion & hopelessly in love with a husband who, she believes in despair, no longer loves her.    In this DVD collection, Elizabeth McGovern most often appears as a frumpy hausfrau rather than a sparkling coquette.  McGovern played Marguerite without wit or common sense, & Carpenter's script didn't help.  For example:  Marguerite (a bourgeois who should have known better) tries to pass herself off at the gates of Paris as a seamstress.  Five seconds later, her lily-white, uncallused hands are inspected by the captain of the guard, and she is hauled off to prison.  Carpenter didn't even let Marguerite's character -- the consummate actress -- PROTEST this treatment, much less run, struggle, or attempt to bluff her way out of her predicament.  Marguerite simply walks off between her guards!!  (::groan::)  In DVD #2, she sits meekly in a convent, waiting for Madame Guillotine's troops to discover her and drag her away.  In DVD #3, she spies on 2 characters, learning the double-identity of the villain.  The villain leaves, but the sidekick remains; several minutes later, Marguerite returns from a chat with Percy to rummage through the villain's belongings.  At this point, neither the actress nor the screenwriter allow Marguerite the common sense to first SEARCH THE AREA FOR THE SIDEKICK to make sure that her snooping goes unobserved.  Naturally, this plot contrivance leads to Marguerite's capture later.  ::double groan::  I could go on and on about the characterization of Marguerite as a stupid female, but I'm sure you get the point.  And now you're probably wondering if there is ANYTHING to commend you to this series.  Well, yes, to be fair, there is:  Martin Shaw, who was cast as Chauvelin.    Shaw portrayed Chauvelin as a real human being with passions, prejudices, longings and yes, moments of real malice.  He also had occasional moments of nobility.  He gave the only consistent performance of real depth in this series.  Even in the scenes where Percy completely humiliated Chauvelin, either by word or by sword, Chauvelin somehow remained sympathetic, which, by contrast, left Percy either looking over-the-top arrogant or a tad bit cruel.  In general, the worst storyline of this series is on DVD #2.  MADAME GUILLOTINE has enough plot contrivances to gag an ox.  The 3rd DVD, THE KIDNAPPED KING, is by far the best of the series -- but, sadly, that isn't saying much.    If you're a glutton for punishment and you really MUST purchase this series, I recommend that you amuse yourself by watching the REALLY BAD ACTING of the extras in the crowd scenes (especially on DVD #1).  However, if you want to watch a REALLY GOOD version of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one that is faithful to Orczy's novel, view the 1980s version that stars Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour.  Andrews is comical AND heroic -- a man to fall in love with.  Seymour is a spunky, resourceful heroine that will make audiences cheer.  You might also enjoy the Leslie Howard version, with beautiful Merle Oberon as Marguerite, which was released in 1935.  Both actors do a credible job with Orczy's characters, and the script is faithful to her book.    Happy viewing 
 OS 10.4 seeks to be all things to all men, thus it contains many MB of no possible use to most users. It needs to include a purging program to remove trash. Fonts in foreign languages, translations (how many people in the US want to convert classical Chinese to simplified Chinesw), printer drivers for printers that the user doesn't have consume a great deal of space. This book needs to be far more aggressive.  
 I have seen Julia Ormond in some good movies and she is a great actress. This is not one of them. Senseless subject. The audio is bad, or the language is not what I am used with, so I understood only half of what they said in the movie. Stay away from this one 
 The movie begins with a short opening pre-credits action set piece which had nothing to do with the actual film in any way followed by one very short but well staged aikido fight very early on within the first hour and that's about all the action there is until the last 20 minutes which is full on action when we get another aikido fight similar to the end of The Glimmer Man and a long sword fight battle as Seagal takes down the Yakuza gang. For an hour of Into The Sun we watch Seagal drive around Tokyo talking to various people he has known over the years and that's really all there is to this until the last 20 minutes. Seagal again has a hand in writing this and the script is just bad and really takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie. What is with Seagal bedding very very! young Asian girls in all his movies lately.  He is doubled in about 80 percent of all external shots of his character walking to locations and entering buildings.  I don't mind Seagal doing movies that are more thrillers than action movies now that he is getting on in years and I'd even welcome the change if they were written with believability, simple plots and good production values and some well staged action set pieces, be it gun play or martial arts. I'm more disappointed  with Into The Sun because I really wanted to enjoy it and thought it looked like the one to help Seagal get back to mainstream directors who know what they are doing behind a camera. I bought this without renting it first based on reviews posted here obviously by blinded fanatical fans of Seagal who can not seem to be objective regarding the quality of Seagals movie releases. I will not make the same mistake again as I also did with Ticker. Rent before you buy........  
 After receiving the item I installed it in my Explorer and gave it a test run while out Christmas shopping. The picture quality on the main unit was outstanding, however the other monitor had distortion and what looked to be signal problems. I returned the item and received another from Amazon, Kudos to Amazon for being so fast with the replacement. I installed the second item, and had the same problems. Needless to say we returned that one too and went with a different DVD player 
 it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. jo 
 I have several other pieces in this collection which I absolutely love. When I was able to find the salad server set at Amazon.com for a cheaper price, I couldn't wait to order it. When it came, I was more than disappointed. The set looked like it had either been 100 years old and was all tarnished (which it is not supposed to ever do), or someone had bought it, tried to clean it with a polish (again, something that is not supposed to be done) and it wore away the finish. I also bought the medium size bowl to go with the salad server set, and when that came, it was all scratched! Needless to say, I returned both for a full refund immediately. Obviously, the cheaper price meant cheaper quality in this case...and it wasn't dirt cheap to begin with, I still had paid $75.00 for it, compared to $150.00 that it is sold in stores for 
 This book had lots of beautiful quilts but not much in the way of how to information.  Not worth the money 
 This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data--such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.  On pp. 33-35, the author looks at success factors, and compares to the role of luck on pp. 82-85, which he downplays in favor of discipline. While he touches on the importance of having the right connections (and the genetic contributions to intelligence), on p. 85 he asks "what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school? What does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice? Very little, according to these physicians." But what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood, let alone be able to attend a medical school? Quite a bit.  Unlike its predecessor, which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) vs. under-accumulators of wealth (UAWs), this book focuses on millionaires (PAWs) and decamillionaires (a tiny subset of PAWs, those with net worth $10M or greater). The lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book's value.  A misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp. 76ff makes the point. Stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth. But this comparison is misleading because he's only looking at the millionaire-plus sample; he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers. The average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers. If he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers, for example, the problem is more obvious--by excluding all those who aren't worth $1M or more up front, you exclude the vast majority, and pull up the average. With stockbrokers, on the other hand, a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy.  On p. 110, after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising "Never lie. Never tell one lie." (p. 55), he passes right over his example, Mr. Warren, lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job, without comment, and without noticing the hypocrisy.  On pp. 173-174, the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress, despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray. (He repeats this again on p. 370, saying "nearly one-half of the millionaires (47 percent) engaged in prayer. ... for a significant percentage of millionaires, their religious faith is a major force in their lives.")  In trying to emphasize the point (p. 174), he splits his sample into "religious millionaires" (RM) and "other millionaires" (OM), observes that 75% of RM engage in prayer while only 8% of OM do, and points out that this is "a ratio of more than nine to one." This is a meaningless comparison, however--RM make up only 37% of his total population of millionaires, so his "more than nine to one" ratio is really nothing more than saying, of those millionaires who are religious, three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer (and 8% of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway). Since the OM population is much larger than the RM population, in absolute numbers that's not a nine-to-one ratio--his numbers show that about 28% of his total sample are RM who pray, while 5% of his total sample are OM who pray--closer to a six-to-one ratio.  But more importantly, the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious, even a quarter of those who are don't engage in regular prayer! Given that the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world, the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause, but for Stanley, religion and prayer are an important foundation of the "millionaire mind," and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population.  In a later table in the book on p. 366, he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days. The table includes 52% attending religious services, 47% praying, 37% attending religious events, 22% Bible/devotional reading. These numbers don't quite match up with the RM/OM data from pp. 173-174, which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity, but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population--and weekly church attendance is notoriously over-reported in surveys. Work by Mark Chaves, C. Kirk Hardaway, and P.L. Marler in the 1990s found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show. This actually could mean that millionaires attend more often, if Stanley's survey results don't have similar over-reporting.  The author's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she, despite not being a church attendee, search for a mate by joining a church group (p. 268) because she "believed in marriage and the traditional family concept." He writes that "I believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars. Of course, there are no guarantees, but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the Good Book." But why is he just guessing on this? Hasn't he asked his population of millionaires--the ones who are 63% non-religious--how they met their mates? He did this, very usefully, regarding how millionaires purchase their homes (pp. 315-326)--yet isn't picking a partner even more important?      This book has some interesting data, and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations (e.g., the house-purchasing characteristics of economically productive millionaires vs. non-economically productive millionaires in chapter 7). But it doesn't stand up well in comparison to The Millionaire Next Door, which is a much better book 
 This Book is not about the making of Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs. At page 115 (!) The Dominoes goes in the studio. Before that you get the story about how pretty Pattie Boyd was (and still is). There are some interesting stories in this book, but none of them are about the making of Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs. Why Does This Book Got To Be So Bad? The answer is: Jan Reid is not focused on the music. 
 Linda Ashcroft crafted a well-written book of fiction. The dates she claims to have been with Morrison have been publicly proven as inaccurate. She was sued by the Morrison family when the book was first published in Europe and she lost the case, 3/4ths of her advance money and the book was pulled from the shelves. When the book was edited and published in the US, it was proven she did not know Jim and she again lost her advance money and her publishing company canceled her book tour and refused to do any promotion. It would be a great book if she just published it for what it is...fiction. 
 Eugene O'Neill may have been the father of American theatre, but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in Long Day's Journey into Night. O'Neill's characters were shallow, pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.The father-son relationship between James Tyrone and his son, Jamie, is meanspirited, and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems. Tyrone regularly refers to Jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn Jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, Edmund. Tyrone says such things as "You'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!"(p.32) and comments to Edmund that, "If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it."(p.131). The characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. The only seemingly normal relationship is between Edmund and Jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. The relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. It is as if they entire family is bipolar.  Long Day's Journey into Night was based on the life of O'Neill himself, with the character of Edmund as O'Neill. The mother of O'Neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between O'Neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted O'Neill for who he was. These sad beginnings continued throughout the life of O'Neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. If the characters in Long Day's Journey into Night are closely based on his family members then O'Neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine 
 Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, "Enderverse".  I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.  I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.  It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics.  Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years.  I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics 
 . .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the "experiment", providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while "researching" his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the "Larry King Live" program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his "without a trace" cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the "Triangle"), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to "disappear without a trace", and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for "entertainment purposes only" 
 I used to think this film was okay but it's really lame. He's going home only cause he wants a car, shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas. They only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season 
  It sound like a 5year old mischievious girl fooling with violin for pure curiosity! it make no sense to serious classical music but probabily still sounds 3stars if you take it for a vivaldi-pop 
 Compared to the wit and flair I had expected, I found this volume boring and dull. It is largely a compilation (with Suskin providing brief notes) of theatrical reviews. Approach this with care if, as I did, you searched on a star's name and found a mention in this book - it may be only one line.   I had expected great humour, inside knowledge, entertaining stories of the backstage. Frankly, I wish I had kept the receipt - I would have returned it the next day 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 This book tries to cover everything and succeeds at very little.  It covers everything from how to build a smoker from a used refrigerator to recipes.  But.. none of these topics are covered extensively or very well.    The illustrations are weak; the recipes are very weak; and, the general process discussions are haphazardly organized.    I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews, but am very disappointed 
 The book was only $10 so I'll chalk it up as a learning experience, I guess.  The recipes are very "1970's-Use-A-Can-of-Campbell's Mushroom Soup-in-Everything" for me.  Or Velveeta.  Or some other 'processed' food item.  I cook fresh for the most part.  There has to be a way to avoid high sodium, processed, fake food and freeze well...right 
 This is a good book for people who want to learn more about the great  Italian luthier, but it definitely has its flaws. The book was written  around the turn of the 20th century and its style is very stilted and  convuluted. I often had the feeling the authors could have conveyed the  information they give us in two pages in one paragraph. Also, their worship  of anything related to Stradivari gets to be a bit much after awhile.  Still, this is the book to turn to for information on this great violin  maker 
 I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich!  I quickly read all of them and wanted more!  Then I found the "Full" series, including this volume, "Full Bloom".  I was really disappointed to find that this is just an average romance, not very well-written.  The humor, which just flows in the Plum novels, is very strained.  A better choice for Stephanie Plum fans who are waiting for the next installment might be "Bubbles in Trouble" or any of the "Bubbles" books.  
 Ads for this sweeper are very misleading.  I've used it 3 times and each time it has only picked up some dog hair and nothing else.  It will never pick up: Tiny pieces of thread, paper, leaves, dirt, etc and these were all very tiny pieces.  You can roll the thing back and forth over these items 20 times and all it does is move them an inch or two, never pick up. The amount of time it takes to use the tiny comb they provide to clean the roller brush takes longer than getting out the vacuum to do the job over.  The handle comes in several pieces and even when assembled as instructed the handle will not stay together. It constantly falls apart and has to be put back together.  You can get around this at least by using duct tape.  Unless you have a very low pile carpet or berber, and the ONLY thing you ever have to pick up is pet hair, this Bissell product is a total waste of mone 
 Blah, blah, and more blah.  That is the summary of George H. Smith's "Atheism".  There are some fine paragraphs and some interesting ideas, but much of the book is stuff like "the epistomology of reason gives metaphysical analysis pause to consider theological corrolaries".  I'm sure a philosopher really enjoys seeing "epistomology" and "metaphysics" in every paragraph of the book, but I think it just obscures a straightforward discussion.  If Smith were direct, he would say that believing in a god is like believing in "unies"--no reliable person can describe that word in terms we can understand; no one has seen a unie; and those who believe in unies are no better off than those who don't.  Therefore, god is a concept that doesn't make any sense and doesn't warrant our attention.  He gets carried away at the end (and therefore the reading is more interesting) bashing Jesus' teachings as unoriginal and likely to cause believers "emotional suicide".  This is not an enjoyable or interesting book, for the most part, and I wouldn't recommend it to others 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 While I tend to always take the horror movie genre with a grain of salt, this movie kind of irked me. I mean I read how the director/writer of this film is an editor at Cinescape, so I had hoped that the movie would not fall into some of the pitfalls that   most of the recent horror films have fallen into. This is not true, there are pitfalls a plenty in this. There was SO much potential at least I thought, but the movie falls flat rather quick. The pace of the film is very off setting and to be honest I was watching it on Scifi (my local video store doesn't have it), but yet I was kind of losing track of who is who and what they were doing in the haunted aslyum in the first place (example Meg and her brother. I also think the  BIGGEST AAGGGHH moment was when the  friend and the blonde hero girl (see can't remember names cause it was truly eh characters and characterization) were sitting on the lobby and talking, and the girl sees a shadow while the guy is looking at her, and she asks: "Did you see that?". NO HE WAS LOOKING AT YOU! I just honestly thought it could of had been better, although the maggot clown scene was pretty good, it just needed a better film around it 
 There is nothing new in this disappointing book.  If one had never read a book on New Age topics it is a good book but if you are looking for something new you won't find it here 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 When I paid somewhere between $20-$30 a couple of months ago for the OptiFix Pro Kit, I made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners I've owned before.  The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home.  After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods.  In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair!  What's more frustrating - two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable.  I hope fellow CD collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular Memorex product 
 i was inexperienced enough to waste my pocket money on this dam book. i went into the bookstore and the only thing attractive about this book is its cover. i automatically bought this book and made one of my biggest mistakes this year.   the book is slow, and all, ALL, the ONLY thing the book talked about is who married who and had kids, and four uncles married and three of them divorced, married again, some romance that i bet many people find depressing.   my mom made me read this last night, and i just could not keep up, i have seen many reviews, whether positive or negative, cannot hide the fact that the book is hard-to-keep-up, complicated, and confusing. Mrs. Quidlen is a newspaper reporter, and she definitely need to cut out a load of useless scenes and details when writing a novel.  I anounce to every reviewers of this book, to the people who read this book only cuz their school made them to, to not lie and betray your inner feelings about this book, to the boys i suggest they let out their inner anger and frustration inside when writing a report and not let some sexy paragraphs in the book make you feel that the book is "good." To the girls, i dont know what to say to the girls, i have many reviews of this book, and the girls had always gave the book a high score. maybe girls enjoyed flat family and friends relationships more than guys do. and i accept that.  here is this basic profile of this book i have made up, i tried to make them as truthful as to anybody any sex as possible.    |plot- no plot, confusing  |humor- very rare, about 20 pages any funny moments appear.  |age- teen to adult  |dialog/narration- huge continous chunks of narration that sometimes seemed never-ending, then huge chunks of continous dialogs.  |mood- sad, with occasional depressive humor.  |sex- definitely a girl's book.  |details- many useless details such as a scar on someone's body without the description of where the scar is or how did he get that scar, with no details that moves the story forward such as the setting, the main character's age, and personalities, the reader has to figure out the personality of each character by reading their dialogs.  |style- Anna Quidlen's own unique and strange style.    i will end my review here by stressing the fact that future readers must express their real, deep feeling about this book, regardless of the author's other books, and other people's feelings. write only about what YOU feel and what you feel ONLY.  
 I have to say that "Rock of Gibraltar" and "She Passed by My Window" are definitely two of the worst songs Mr.Cave has ever written. No wonder Blixa left. The only song that keeps this album from drowning is "Right Out of Your Hand", a sublime country-ballad that's way up there with "The Ship Song", "Slowly Goes the Night", and "Love Letter". Thank God Mr. Cave's muse came back after this disappointment. 
 If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect:  a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs.  In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality.  Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly.  By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending.  DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods 
 For the times this movie was made, the acting is good. I would love to see this same story done in more modern times where I believe the acting would be less in the dramatic style and seem more real to life. If you've read the book, this movie cuts out so much of what I loved in the book. I wish not only that it would be done in modern times but I can see it being done in a trilogy style to capture all the interaction of characters and the essence of the story would be more complete. If you have to choose between the book and the movie, choose the book 
 The book covers only basic grammar;quite boring; doesn't make much sense. I would not recommand this book 
 This is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old NOT 8-11 as it states. Talk about a waste of money. I returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the Christmas tree this year. It was a shame the description wasn't more accurate, because I was not refunded my expedited shipping costs I paid for this "TOY" Thumbs Dow 
 I read the author's first novel many years ago and picked this one up, thinking it would evoke some of the same wit and originality of the first. Sadly, this was not the case. Unfortunately, Mr. Weir's second novel is convoluted and more than a little boring. Before you buy it, flip through a copy at your local bookstore. That should suffice. 
 Many, many years ago I read Catherine Coulter, read her avidly, eagerly looking forward to her next book. Well, this is the first one of hers that I have read in about a decade and WHAT HAPPENED? Three times I set this book down in disgust, only to come back to it out of sheer stubbornness.  There is not enough room to write about just how bad this book was. From generally poor writing (Mary Lisa said, Jack said, Lou Lou said... until you want to yell "I KNOW who is involved in this conversation!), silly plot, unneccessary side stepping.   WHO CARES that the hero digs a chunky chip into guacamole? OH WOW, we get to know the different flavors of potato chips being devoured by three woman while they talk about the big case. WHEN have any of us heard of investigating cops asking "why is she wearing those pajamas when you are wearing those"? YEAH sure, an agent involved in a case is going to let endangered person call the shots in even the tiniest part of the investigation. And the names! Mary Lisa? Lou Lou? Puker? Gimme a freaking break! Aaaarrrrggggg!!!   Ms. Coulter, I used to love your books. PLEASE get back to what you used to do so well. If you cannot write the "FBI style" books that are so popular now, then don't. STOP feeding the bestseller beast anything less than your best. Cease. Desist. Please go back to what you are great at 
 Irvine Welsh has been a lot of things to a lot of different people- some say he's the best thing to happen to British writing in a decade, some say he's just a flash-in-the-pan with uncouth sensibilities who writes thoughtless, violent stories about amoral scumbags. Say what you will about Welsh as a writer- be it that he's talented, sick, brilliant, strange or just plain nuts- but he is, and has never been, boring. Until now. "Marabou Stork Nightmares" is a colossal letdown after the one-two punch of "Trainspotting" and "The Acid House", a jumbled, convoluted tale about a repugnant [man] trawling his last moments away in a life that most closely resembles a bedridden hell. This is not the first first-person account of a psychopath that Welsh has written- see later, his aptly-titled "Filth"- but even at his worst, D.S. Bruce Robertson had a sort of perverse wit to him, while this story lacks anything short of coherence, wit, humor or even plot.  The protagonist of this brutish tale is Roy Strang, a bedridden criminal pissing the last moments of his sad life away in a bed, ready to die. As he slowly slips in and out of consciousness, Roy reflects on the family upbringing- that entailed rape, sexual molestation and the vicious abuse of his right-wing Uncle- that led him to this state. We see later in his life, as Roy attempts to straighten himself out, get a job and "choose life", as it were, but we continue to see that he cannot escape the sins of his past. All the while, he hunts the formidable African Predator the Marabou Stork- a personification of all the misery, evil, hatred, pain and badness in Roy himself- on a wild Safari in Africa, that ostensibly all takes place in Roy's morphine-and-depravity-addled brain.  The novel proves that Welsh can still pull plenty of tricks out of his proverbial hat when it comes to language- some of his bawdy, boy's-night-out Scottish dialogue still provokes a chuckle or two, while the disgusting gangrape scene towards the book's denouement is one of the more haunting I have read in recent memory. And yet, for all its mild pleasures, this book still sees Welsh falling majorly short of the mark, sinking into the endless mire of Roy Strang's egomaniacal fever dream. Consider this one a real "Nightmare" 
 On the plus side: It is good to have an advocate for the role of emotions and feelings in rational thought. There can be no doubt that both emotions and feelings have a crucial role to play in learning, discovery, persuasion, belief and insight; the challenge, which Dammassio is not equipped or inclined to meet, is to define the boundaries of the proper role of emotions in rational thought. It is not clear to me how Dammassio would advise members of a jury to weigh the evidence before them 'dispassionately'. Or perhaps he would advise that they shouldn't? Despite the eccentricity of ascribing 'emotions' to single cell organisms, I appreciate Dammassio's distinction between emotions - dispositions organisms adopt, more or less automatically, in response to stimuli which serve to promote restoration of homeostasis, and feelings - dispositions of the mind in which perceptions of emotions expressed in the body, in turn modify those same emotions, and for which mental events can also act as stimuli. This sets up the suggestive and useful idea of the 'brain-body loop', including the 'as-if brain-body loop' where the stimulus is mental. This conception allows Dammassio to explain how the whole body participates in thinking, by mediating processes in the brain. A feeling causes a change in the body (e.g. a tightening of the stomach in response to some cause of anxiety) which in turn produces the sensation of that same emotion (e.g., you feel your stomach tighten, alerting you to your anxiety). This is a very useful idea, and needs in fact the body is able to play this mediating role in brain activity of all kinds, not just feelings and emotions. Dammassio provides a strong argument for understanding the whole person as the appropriate unit for understanding thinking, not just the brain. On the minus side: What is it with this mixture of positivistic, almost Lockean, exposition of human biology, based on 'the latest discoveries of science', in the tradition of Comte, social Darwinism, Ernst Haeckel, Konrad Lorenz, Desmond Morris, Robert Ardrey and company, with, on the other hand, semi-biographical eulogies over the seventeenth century rationalist philosopher Spinoza? It's like the song-and-dance routines put on for pre-match and half-time entertainment at the football. I suspect that Dammassio is relying on a weakness of Spinoza to which he makes a passing reference, namely, that by simply saying that thought and extension are two attributes of the one substance, the difficulty of explaining how thought arises from the activity of material beings is simply by-passed. For this is just what Dammassio does. Like any number of positivists before him, Dammassio finds that 'the latest discoveries of science' have at last given us an understanding of how mental images are formed ... all except for just that last step unfortunately, but that last link in the chain will doubtless be discovered within the next decade or two. Dammassio has the same problem as John Locke: if you see thought as simply the product of one material system interacting with other material systems, then you can push the boundary back further and further (either by speculation or by scientific investigation) but sooner or later you get to that point, and you either insert the homunculus to watch the "movie-in-the-brain" (as Dammassio calls it) or you just hope that that last step will be explained by new discoveries of modern science, just around the corner. Dammassio is sophisticated enough to avoid highlighting the contradiction with any reference to a homunculus, or a yet-to-be-discovered 'control centre' somewhere in the brain, so his ruse seems to be to insert a eulogy to Spinoza in lieu of an explanation. And these 'mirror neurons', introduced to explain empathy, are complete fiction. This is not a claim that needs to be argued, the idea is pure fantasy and the claim to have found the location where they to be found is outrageous. No-one in the field believes it. 'Mirror neurons' are a disturbing step from biological explanation of biological phenomena to biological explanations of social phenomena, and with that, the incipient justification for medical intervention and social engineering as the cure for social problems. All this could be harmless enough. If the object is to improve understanding of the working of the nervous system for the purpose of curing psychiatric illness or brain injury, it is a very worthwhile exercise. But the 'mirror neurons' alert us to the inevitable wider agenda.  For Dammassio, all social institutions  are "mechanisms for exerting homeostasis at the level of the social group", and in fact all social, political and ethical phenomena are "extensions" of these processes within the organism, and have their "forerunners" in the social behaviour of wolves, birds and so on. In other words, puerile social Darwinism of the worst order.  Faced with self-serving naïvité of this breathtaking order, and with obvious fictions like the 'mirror neurons' making their appearance in what is presented as hard neuroscientific fact, one is then somewhat hesitant about accepting as good coin the rather appealing ideas about the role of body maps and emotions in the mediation of thought. Dammassio also cleverly plays with the idea that all the phenomena of culture and human society are somehow less real than the facts of biology, self-aggrandizing illusions of animals who kid themselves that they have become something more. Thus consciousness and mind are "what we call mind and consciousness," (this phrase 'what we call' is used several times). Dammassio is clever enough not, like say Desmond Morris, to be explicit in this ploy, he just suggests to the reader without spelling it out.  
 This book is written by an annoying, weak man.  The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors.  This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating.  I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying.  Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere.  There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here 
 "Tourists are learning that the image of the terrible Turk is false, created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors. Turks are quick to remind visitors that, surrounded by Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, and Greece, they're not living in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood."  This is a direct quote.  It sounds like they're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of Turkey. Which is amusing, since he listed both Greece and Armenia there, which were both targeted by Turkey. Either this writing staff has no idea what they're writing and is just happy to sell books, thinking no one will double check the info, or they're Racist and opinionated. Either way, I wouldn't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go. 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 Reads like an 880-page Disney press release.  Who cares?  Obviously, in a transparent effort to get the toothpaste back into the tube, the Disney Co. hopes to erase a decade or so worth of damaging publicity by hand-picking a stenographer to re-establish the Disney myth.  The agenda is clear, and the result is an amatuerish, bloated, over-written and overwrought cover job.  Not serious journalism and not worth your time 
 Unfortunately the author did not get the basic premise correct. Ukraine does not mean borderland. The oldest use of the word found in written text is in the 10th century chronicle of Slava o Polke Ihoria. The term Ukraine is used as meaning within the kingdom, at the heart of the kingdom. The opposite of what the author writes. Borderland would mean Okraina, this is the difference between in and out. She also missed that Ukraine has the oldest calendar on the planet now dating to 7039. Another significant fact.  Maybe the next book could be an new history based on  archives from Lutsk and Kyiv that the author did not read. Missing such a basic premise clouds the rest of the book 
 There are too many years included in this book. There are hundreds of minor (and not so minor) differences in makes of jeeps over the years. Every year is different and the technology has changed. I could not even find some of the simplest things I needed to know when looking under the hood of my '02 Wrangler Sport. What an incredibly frustrating experience (you car fixers know what I mean!!!) What a waste of my time. What a waste of my money.  I am going to try to get my hands on a dealer/mechanics book 
 Horrible, Horrible, Horrible..better than Democracy in America but still why make us poor college students suffer so much. haven't we paid our debt to society already 
 I was diasppointed that this is a rather basic book for people who are not aware of ageing and nutrional issues.   
 Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of "My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."  I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.   I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  Now, if your "thing" is cows....  Get this book!

 Pretty graphics, no art.  Looks nice but playability sucks.  Terrible keyboard controls, requires multiple clicks from scrolling lists to do simple things like cast a spell.  Quests confusing, sometimes screen pixel hunt and click required.  Very limited, laughable, quick key assignment.  Can't even bring up the area map with a single click/key!!!  No personal journaling or marking maps on this huge game area.  Wait for it on the $9.99 rack, or maybe user content will make something of it.  Seems like a great graphics engine with little RPG behind it.  Seems very much designed by committee with features removed when anyone didn't like it.  Get NeverWinter Nights 1 instead.  Update after about 50 hours into it:  The inside caves, it seems, are made of a very limited tile set.  There is a narrow tunnel, an open cave, and open cave with upper shelves on each side, or a cave with an above cross-over.  Textures are cut stone, some are rough stone, but the shapes are the same.  Very boring, you now know where to look for the monsters.  Guess console players are less demanding.  Too much money went into the cut scenes, not enough into the RPG engine 
      For those of you who have sincerely been seeking the truth about the Holocaust, who have done your homework and read a variety of sources and opinions, this book may well push you completely over into the revisionist ("deniers") camp, as it did me.         Deborah Lipstadt is an Emory University professor of Jewish Religion, NOT history.  She was evidently supported by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in writing this book; they hold the copyright, not her.  Denying the Holocaust is an attempt to respond to Arthur Butz and others who have raised major factual objections to the usual "6 million Jews killed in gas chambers" version of WW II.         Arthur Butz gathered a wealth of research material in his book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century.  Ms Lipstadt responds to his scholarship with things such as name calling, twisted logic, half truths, appeals to emotions, failure to produce evidence, failure to define terms, omitting things, assigning bad motives, answering a question with another question, using big words, etc.  That is why I call her book, Denying the Holocaust, a Holocaust Liar's Handbook.  I value my copy as a wonderful exercise book for seeing through sophistocated lies.        
 I really don't know how this book got a five star rating.  Nersesian's friends must have stuffed the ballots because this book has no redeeming quality what so ever. All the reviews state "this can only happen in New York" and the character Joey, "embodies the perfect paranoia found only in Manhattan".  I have lived in NYC all my life, and if I acted like this idiot, I would have been shot. People, please save your money...you'll thank me for this advice.. 
 This is the second Accu-Gauge tire pressure gauge I have purchased.  The first had very good accuracy and lasted about 3 years.  This one, when compared to three other digital gauges, always shows about 3-4 lbs. less pressure.  
 Reviewer Alianore's opinion "Rather too indulgent of its subject" is a very accurate portrayal of Weir's work. I will try to add something to that near perfect review. (Note: I listened to the unabridged audiobook of "Queen Isabella", 22 hrs on 18 CDs).  The first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. The last third is the worst: Weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of Queen Isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed Just Queen of England.  This book is really "subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization". I do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. It is rhetoric because of the endless "weasel words" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: "Some say", "It has been said", "Many believe", "Therefore we may assume", "It can be inferred" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. These expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with Wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved Isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons.  Equally irksome is Weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. She is always 'declaring' for us the contents of Isabella's thoughts. Remarkable gift she has for this. Many times Weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. But then moments later she will portray Isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how Isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. This isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda.  I don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. The narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. But this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (Other egregious examples of such hagiography include Edmund Morris' "Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and "Theodore Rex". I could not complete either of those since Morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. Yuck. Really.)  If prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. And much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. The only way I could enjoy "Isabella" by Weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with "several pounds of salt" as the above referenced reviewer advises.  2.5/5 
 Speaking as someone with a degreee in math, plus some graduate work, I found this book frustrating and disappointing.  I wanted to fill in some historical perspective to all the math I had learned, but I was little  illuminated by this book.  While the author clearly knows a lot about math,  his writing is vague, poorly organized, and unfocused.  He answered few of  my questions and does not present a coherent picture of his topic.  Rather  than this book, I recommend Morris Kline "Mathematical Thought from  Ancient to Modern Times", which is infinitely better 
 Turn of the Century is so boring and slow moving that it's not worth reading. In the first half of the book, literally close to nothing happens. Added to which, Anderson makes the book so convoluted it's like a badly executed Altman ensemble drama. It's impossible to keep track of all of these characters and formulate a good idea of what they're actually like. Added to which, the highly trumpeted 'Tom Wolfe' style satire in the book is so blunt and obvious that one wonders how many made the connection between Anderson and the esteemed writer of 'Bonfire of the Vanities'. Bottom line: boring, dull and pretty stupid really 
 This is another product placement by Gary Null Inc. repackaged with a new title and cover. Gary Null is a God and knows everything about everything. Gary knows what you should eat and how you should think. Ignore the fact that he owns a private multi-million dollar media, supplement and gadget company that sells nearly all what he advises to consume. No conflict there at all? Gary is a brilliant marketer and here are his tactics:  1)Create documenteries, radio shows, movies, lectures, books that strike fear into your audience so that they are in a constant buying mode. Make them fear to breath the air, to  drink the water and make them fear their enviornment in total. Claim that you are the authority and others are cranks aimed at harming you and your audience. Evoke fear, conspiracy theories at every turn, and taint the competition (mainstream medicine) as immoral, money grubbing and intentionally harm promoting.   2)Provide a catalog of products to calm the fear evoked. Have them buy costly air filtration and water systems, expensive magnetic products, costly vitamins and supplements, and provide media so that you can reinforce the fear and buying behaviour. Advocate a costly and restrictive diet that few could follow for long so that they will fall back on your food replacement and food concentrates as well as vitamins. Above all promise you base that if they follow your advice and buy the products  they will look young and live forever. Promise the suckers that they will avoid sickness and will be the chosen ones.   3) Claim you make little or no money and that the profits go into making public service movies even though you charge to view them, and even though the profit markup on vits and supplements run in the hundreds percent range. Claim that you have advanced degrees and are a scienctific authourity even though you went to nontraditional schools and could not get a degree from a legit University. Should anyone challenge you claim that they are part of a conspiracy to silence you even though that if false- it increases the your profile among followers.   
 A story that fails to engage the reader and leaves Dan Lenson stranded in the desert, with no water in sight. Not up to the earlier efforts 
 OK, so where the heck is Vince Young, Matt Leinart, and Reggie Bush in this version?  You see Reggie Bush on the cover, so you think you're going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner, pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart, and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl.  But none of these players are to be found.  In fact, Ohio State is listed as the #1 team.  Am I behind the times?  Or is this how EA Sports does their football games?  Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime?  I was hoping to be able to play them with updated "abilities" that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005.  Any ideas out there?  Is this a code or a "cheat" I need to unlock?  HELP!! 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 I come from a swimming background, and I am focusing my training on the improvement of my biking and running skills.  I still like to spend about half of my weekly exercise time in the pool.  If you enjoy swimming, avoid this book.  It is for the pool-fearing 
 This book on tape was published early 2001 just in time for listeners to lose a ton in the 2001-2002 stock bust. Almost every investor lost money on stocks then, but a listener following the advice in this book on tape would have lost much more, with some tech stocks never recovering (because of bankruptcy).  Some of the advice is quite good, but about 25% is downright wrong and dangerous. If you know enough to know which advice is good and which is bad, then you don't need this book.  Perhaps something went wrong when abridging the longer written text to produce these audio tapes. In any event, if you still want to give it a shot, or if you just love the Motley Fool, then look for something by the Gardner brothers that's newer and/or not so abridged 
 Lee follows a stream of conciousness/dilettante approach to literary criticism that fails, time and time again, to get to the key issues. 
 To borrow from a previous reviewer:  A movie to kill an evening with if you have one that really needs murdering.  
 It is certainly a beautiful book, with its illustrations, thick and smooth pages, some tips from famous writers. However, as for the ideas-for-writing part, it is certainly not what I've expected.  The content is pretty much the same thing the author has on her web page. I felt like I paid for something that I had already read online. The ideas are fine if you are going to teach a beginners writing workshop and need some ideas for exercises, but nothing else.  It's probably better as a gift than as a tool for a writer. I guess the lesson here is: nobody, but your own brain and experience, can provide you with ideas. Inspiration does not exist and you are your own muse 
 I have to admit that I did like the book, in terms of the writing style.  However, the ending was so abrupt and unbelievable.  I wanted to know what happened with their relationship after those first five minutes back together.  Also, I think Matt should have ended up with Holly, since he spent more time with her than the heroine of the book!  Are we really supposed to believe that he's in love with Josie after everything he did with Holly?!?!  You can probably tell that I was annoyed by this book A LOT, but it was funny 
 If on the one hand, Schmitt's book does contain some brilliant insights - especially in its last pages, where it criticizes liberalism as an inconsistent form of political doctrine - on the other, it seems to me, when all is said and done, the meditation fails its main purpose, which is to show something about the essence of politics.  Because the essence of the political is indeed present in the Freund/Feind situations, but these are only two extreme possibilities of political alterity, which, however, do not exhaust the political field. A profounder and more challenging approach to the notion of the political is that of Max Weber in "Politik als Beruf/The Vocation and Profession of Politics" (1921) and Hans Morgenthau in Scientific Man vs. Power Politics (1946) / Politics among Nations (1948). Their depth resides in their approach via the notion of power. The exercise of power over fellow beings is the true rub of politics. How well did the North-American founding fathers grasp it too!  Schmitt's extreme polarity, to me, is Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan with new garb. And I was quite glad to see evidences in favor of this guess: in the original version of Der Begriff des Politischen, published in 1927 at the Archiv Journal, Schmitt states that Hobbes is the -only- truly systematic political thinker. This compliment was diluted for the text's final version, published in 1932, in which Hobbes appears as "a truly systematic thinker".  Schmitt and Hobbes stand together in their view of man as a power-seeking creature by nature, a hostage of passions and egotism. So far, as the basic generalization, no problem. But then Schmitt goes on to repeat the same faux pas of Hobbes' Leviathan in regard to the solution identified for this condition. Hobbes fell in the trap of proposing the symbolic figure of the pact, by which individuals sacrifice their aspirations in the name of the king, who, in exchange, shall protect them against hostilities from abroad and promote well-being. This, of course, for a political context quite different from the XXth century. In any case, Hobbes' politico-theological thought has little or no room for internal dissent. At the end, in his view, human `reason' and the Scriptures converge; Schmitt agrees with him.  Here are the two implicit errors I see in Hobbes' view of the `Pact'. Firstly, the implicit expectation that humans will be able to sacrifice their passions and ambitions with a view to order and peace, as if they were free. And they are not. Whatever the political system, their desire for power will make itself felt and seek satisfaction. The second implicit error is the expectation that the king will be neutral and can be trusted - once more, the Founding Fathers are called to the scene, the Federalist 51 being their top gem. What guarantees do we have about the king? Is he not a human being just like the others, power-seeking, a hostage to his passions?  The flaw of Hobbes' `philosophy', then, is that its solution does not solve the problem it identifies. What Hobbes does is merely to raise - suspend - project - in a word: procrastinate - the state of nature onto the international arena, without changing its supposed essence. One would then have - if premises were truly followed - communities under pact from within, and without inner dissent, at war against all the others. Thus the logical extension - and here is Schmitt's insight, perhaps unconsciously: within the body politic, in the case the state, there could then only be friends and foes to the will of this body's head. And among the other bodies politic, as they interact, there could also be only friends/allies and foes.  
 The author presented quite a rosy picture on China. On privatization, this book praised the successful gradual approach of the government. On institutional reform and liberalization, the market forces and foreign investors seem to be transforming China into a "rational" and democratic system.  Although the author distances himself from the neoliberals on the issue about privatization, his logic on institutional transition and modernization nevertheless make him more of a neoliberal than otherwise. This book described the policy reforms and changes of social control mechanism nicely, but not the social problems and challenges resulted from the reform.  Optimism is fine, but downplaying the uncertainties and social ills associated with globalization is not. The excessive optimism of the book make it like an English version of a Chinese official textbook 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 I was not satisfied with this book after having read Paul Benzequin's book about the same subject.  More time is spent on the court trial of the owners than necesary.  Very little time is spent on the treatment and identification of the victims.  What about Dotty Myles, Shirley Freeman and Jacob Slate to name three of the victims that were treated in hospitals?  What about the index card system that volunteers set up to help identify victims that were mentioned in Mr. Benzequins book?  If someone wants to choose between Mr. Benequin's book about the fire and this book they should read Mr. Benzequin's book! 
 Grammatical structure in this book is not addressed properly. Asking students to memorize numerous verb conjugations is difficult and tedious. It would be far more effective to have students learn the rule for verb conjugation. That way they can apply it to any verb. This book takes this approach to most other grammatical technicalities, making it difficult for a student to learn Japanese effectively 
 One of them arrived damaged on the printer head so did not even print one page.  The other one did not print as many pages as I'd expected.  Besides the color fades away too fast. Contacted the company without any reply.  You'd better go for the genuine HP product. 
 After reading this you'll want to nail somebody to something to.  What type of spirit in the word spiritual did the writer of these musings mean.  After this man is departed they will have to add another circle to hell.  This is just sacarine coated nausious rubbish.  I despair at some publishers sometimes. 
 There is simply no way anyone could like this safe.  1) The drawer cannot take *ANY* weight. Forget about even putting a few coins it it because once you do, it won't open!  2) It eats batteries like a 500lb man eats hamburgers.  Literally a full pack of AA batteries every few weeks!  The reason is, this thing flashes lights even when nobody is near it or it is not in use.  3) Cheap construction, this thing is engineered to FAIL. Half the time the drawer fails to open, the keypad fails to work, and it flakes out the other half of the time.  Avoid this junk at all costs 
 This book was written to give the reader a sense of what life was like in the Middle Ages and it did, however, the author tried to use the life of Cecilia Penifader as an example-bad choice. There is very little information about this woman (especially to write a book over)and it was a guessing game at what she did or did not do. Without Cecila and her family information this book probably would have been 10 pages shorter and still given the reader a look into life in a medeival town 
 Nobody is a bigger fan of Macca than myself, but this album is not one of his best.  It sounds more like a sound test than an inspired homage to his childhood musical influences.  I don't hear enthusiasm in his voice, and the music sounds too polished.  It really lacks soul if nothing else.  Run Devil Run, a similar effort, is everything this album is not: raw, full of energy, and clearly a labor of love.  To me RDR is far superior to this collection 
 I really didn't enjoy this book. The writing was somewhat confusing, and there were pages missing. A better job of proofreading should have been done 
 i have never written a review of anything in my entire life, but feel it is my duty to warn you that if you are not extremely experienced in pilates , have incredibly strong abdominal muscles during pregancy and have no issues with balance...then do NOT do this workout.  I am truly horrified. There are absolutely no instructions or modifications given depending on what trimester you are in. The abdominal workout is downright scary at least for someone in their 3rd trimester. The side leg workout is rigorous but good, however there are stretches shown lying flat on your back..an absolute no no for anyone over 20 wks and there are standing stretches on one leg that are NOT even shown using a chair...very dangerous...and by the way, pre pregnancy i was a 5mile a day runner who was very adept and pilates and yoga...all i can say is in my humble opinion, this workout is nowhere near the vicinity of being safe..buyer beware 
 Santayana has a flowing style and is a master of rhetoric.  Do not read  this work if you are looking for a well argued thesis.  He lets points  stand on sweeping generalizations that will only be accepted by those  already in agreement.  Santayana's critiques of religion rest upon  sociology rather than philosophy, and his appreciation of religion is  limited and patronizing 
 If you find another source for this movie, pursue it! I liked the movie very much, and saw it first produced on Showtime Entertainment.  This copy appears to be burn made from someone's TV set.  Good movie for cheesy fun films, poor quality recording. 
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 Eric Davin is a left wing nut case. Any thing he writes is really bad. I dont like the book. You would have to pay me to read it twice. I think he might still be upset that the USSR went capitalist. Poor Baby 
 Too large - they obscure tabs beneath. They are so wide they make 4 rows instead of 2. 
 I first read about Jack Parsons in the L.A. Times and it got me intrigued.  When I bought the book I thought it was going to be filled with nothing but his eccentricities and that's wanted I wanted to read.  But it got real technical.  Pages of his U.S patents which I did not find interesting.  The author did his homework as far as the smallest details of Parson's life.  Going so far as to tell you where Parsons lived (and dates of residency) and he moved quite a bit.  I did enjoy reading about the relationship he had with Alister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard which portrays him (Hubbard) as a con man he is.  Basically, it's a technical book that I feel didn't quite hit the mark.  
 What is put forth as "a middle course" and "(presenting)...main lines of evidence" repeatedly degrades into a manifesto of personal agenda. What sporadic critical thought is found in these pages amounts to a mere couple chapters in competing books in this genre. The manner in which the authors completely ignore or gloss over both significant relevant issues and glaring holes in their personal favorite theories, which they put forth on nearly every topic, continually presenting opinion as scientific fact, is frustratingly irritating.  Of particular note, the authors' somewhat whiney complaining about what they view as undeserved popularity garnered by Fingerprints of the Gods is a CONSTANT theme and is unpleasantly reminiscent of Howard Cosells infantile rants about retired professionals being allowed to commentate on the sports they mastered. While Fingerprints was clearly submitted as something of a thought experiment by a journalist, this book was presented as an unbiased scholarly appraoch (yet this books authors spend so much type complaining that it comes of as an obsessive negative review of Hancocks book). The authors' near disgust that anyone could actually find Hancocks book entertaining is omnipresent. Fingerprints was put forth by a journalist who made no qualms about clearly expressing interpretation and opinion as such and tried to lead the reader through a journey of layman investigation of entertaining questions. This book, however fails miserably at being the scholarly contemplative effort it claims to be. Indeed, it clearly does not even attempt to be that, but merely declared that it would in the course of CONTINUAL fallacies which permeate the book (I am a mathematician and I wouldn't care to count the times the authors commit "poisoning of the well" alone).  Time and again the authors speak of convential science views as if they are necessarily what they present them as, which they often are not, and are gospel. The repetitive diatribe in which they constantly preach orthodoxy is severely abrasive to anyone who reads the book for an unbiased viewpoint. Despite the promise to present facts and let the reader decide, they continually slap the reader in the face with their personal opinions; ending nearly every idea with a declaration of their favored perspective as fact or at least portraying it as if it is the only possible sensible interpretation, despite a theme of absense of fact in the ideas they clearly attempt to send to the "head of the class".   The tiresome theme of bashing Hancocks book is so continuous that it becomes nauseating; I wouldn't keep bringing this up, but I realized it would be completely necessary to do so in any truthful review around page 230....when the authors were STILL harping about Hancocks book. This book was NOT advertised as being an editorial reply to that book and I was frankly quite irritated to see it was exactly that.  Theories which are contrary to their desires are dismissed, much as a child unreasoningly repeats the mantra of "I don' wanna!".   They mention, in one perfectly characteristic instance, 6 facts about the Minoan Atlantis hypothesis which supposedly debunk it absolutely:             1) They mention that the volcanic explosion of Thera is inconsistent with tidal wave and earthquake effects, which is actually a poor estimate of the destructive powers of a tremendous volcanic explosion on a nearby island (a hallmark of the inadaquacies of scholarship of the authors work in this book is their riding the fence on Plato; they use his writings to supposedly "prove" their favored ideas, and selectively attribute many other of his writings to fantasy). Thier portrayal of the explosion of Thera is so completely uninformed that one can only wonder how someone could defend them in presenting it.             2 & 3) They mention 2 things which are actually archaelogically verified and speak for the Minoan Hypothesis, but say these facts are insignificant because they each occurred in some other locations as well.             4) The authors make one of their characteristically incredulous remarks in proposing that Platos account lacking bull-leaping games, one of the many sports of Minos, somehow goes towards providing an incongruity!             5) They out-of-hand dismiss ALL other possible parallels without addressing or even presenting them; calling them collectively "too weak to merit discussion" (despite that being what the authors FALSELY put forth as this books purpose)!             6) Lastly, they attempt to say that the Minoan theory "completely collapses" when you consider that it's 'factor of 10' lemma can't be applied universally, despite the fact that it was explicitly not to be used for those (mostly indirect) applications. The authors then go on to completely omit ALL size and chronology information from their hard-sell of their pet viewpoint (except, inexplicably, a couple dates that they haven't contemplated enough to realize CANNOT be made to fit the model of Plato that they pick and choose from so freely; like an unruly child they leave the portions which are unsavory to them)!   Thus throughout thier entire argument, there is not one valid point speaking against the minoan hypothesis and a number of things which speak for it. Thus, there is no justification for thier conclusions. Yet, as is typical for them, they go on to put forth thier favored theory as fact, speaking down to any reader who has noticed that there is no support for thier conclusions in thier writings. Their free exchange of distict mythological entities in this article is typical: the par for their course being at once particularly irresponsible, humorous and frustrating.   I feel that the Minoan Atlantis hypothesis, and indeed all specific Atlantis hypotheses, are without any abundance of substance; but given the authors declared subject matter for this book (which indeed is a false declaration), the scholastic irresponsibility and selective ignorance of fact, used to promote personal opinion throughout, are sophomoric and reprehensible.  While I rarely put pen to a bad review, I felt compelled to warn readers that this book is poor remedial journalism in scholarly clothing. A journalistic approach is perfectly viable when presented as such, to put forth something seething with bias as impartial academic investigation is pick-pocketing. The aggresive hard-sell agenda grates strongly on the impartial reader. The childish arguments used, including calling anyone who questions certain of thier ideas "racists" out-of-hand (! I do not know anyone can defend a book which does this and portrays itself as scholarly !) and continual use of logical fallacies, are enough to insult the intelligence of any reader who tries to approach the topics of discussion without walking in step with the bias of the authors.  Pass on this one, there are plenty of books written on these topics, some legitimately scholarly, some more open-minded, which deal with the ancient mysteries herein without treating the reader to a manifesto of slant.  -true__ibnFrey  :)   *** edit: elucidation forced by above reviews ***  Reviews are supposed to address the product, not make failed flailing attempts to attack another reviewer while avoiding the fact that thier comments are unbiased and truthful. My comments centered on the lack of scholarship in the book, so saying I feel like the book is "blasphemy" only shows that you either did not read my review or did not understand it. What I said is fact and someone attacking me for taking exception at an author calling anyone who doesn't agree with them: "racists" does not retroactively remove that comment from thier book. Niether does it remove the method of presenting thier favored ideas as fact from nearly every topic. Nor does it, though some mystical convection, convey consistency upon the fallacious arguments used throughout the book.  It has been 3 years and there is not one point I made that anyone can contend with. The authors arguments do not hold up under any scrutiny whatsoever. Please examine what I wrote above about thier supposed dubunking of the Minoan hypothesis (one which I do not particularly subscribe to myself, though most scholars who do try to place an Atlantis do so in the Minoan empire); not one point they made holds up under any scrutiny. They continually write on a topic as if what they are saying is the only legitimate way to look at it, despite thier stated goal of pursuing a "middle course". Once one sees that thier argument on a topic contains no merit, it becomes a waxing task to continue to the next topic, which is simply more of the same from these authors.   This book is not scholarly and isn't even legitimately journalistic. It is a hard-sell of particular ideas of the authors, which is exactly what it was advertised as not being. I understand many people are used to just going along with what someone makes "sound good", but thier "arguments" fall apart exactly as thier "argument" against the Minoan Atlantis hypothesis did (see above); indeed they are not attempts at legitimate argument but attempts to to use compositional content to sway and when necessary berate the reader into the authors favored views (views they say they won't put into the book but are nonetheless omnipresent).   There are a lot of books in this genre and this one simply does not measure up. To get what most people are looking for when they look at this book (i.e. an impartial scholarly approach), and not a bunch of fallacious arguments which will fall apart and make you look like a fool in front of anyone who's read anything scholarly on the topic, try "THE SEVENTY GREAT MYSTERIES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD" Fagan, et al. For a cursory examination of ancient civilizations, albiet not centered on mysteries exclusively, try BBCs "Civilizations: Ten Thousand Years of Ancient History" Macintosh & Twist. For particular mysteries, try scholarly works such as "Noah's Flood" Ryan & Pittman, but save yourself time, money and face by avoiding this pulp promotion of the precept "Sapientia, delenda est!" (Ceterum censeo Sapientia esse delendam. -- James/Thorpe)    I don' wanna say "I told ya so", but that's the point I'd like to make ;)  GL HFA :D -true__ibnFre 
 I remember when this came out and as a guitar player myself, I was highly intrigued with the names involved on this project. My initial impression of April Lawton was to hang up my guitar and forget the whole thing (she is/was a damn good guitar player). Afterwords I realized that this album is quite an embarrasment. Their next release, the more acoustic In April Came the Dawning of the Red Suns is a MUCH better effort. 
 I bought this case together with Nikin 5900 digcam. The case looks good and compact. But the main problem is with the pockets. There are two pockets for SD cards in the main pocket and one outer pocket for the battery. The problem is that when you open the case to take the camera, all the pockets are also open and stuff can fall from there. Specially when its on your belt.  I won't use this case 
 So we have this book in our house because my fiance is a veterinarian, and so everyone gives us dog and cat books.  I picked this book up for the first time during a late-night power outage, and I've got to say, the pictures in this book had me laughing and smiling, but the text had me pulling my hair out.  Sure, all dog owners put words into their dogs mouths, but most of Mr. Blount's are painfully irritating.  First off, if dogs are going to be poets (which I don't really get), they ought to at least rhyme, not just ALMOST rhyme.  Furball and terrible?  Blount too often struggles to to be poignant (though the bulldog with the stick is right on) and ends up missing the mark.  Valerie Shaff has captured the essence of what makes dogs special in her pictures, but the messages conveyed by these wonderful images are cheapened by Blount's poor poetry.  I've got "I am puppy, hear me yap" on the shelf, and I'll bring it out during the next power outage.  Hopefully Blount spent more than 10 minutes on the text for this book.. 
 Spiders are still hanging out in my garage happily and I don't have a big garage, either 
 (2 1/2 stars) The thing I hate the most about soundtracks, is the soundtracks that don't have all the songs used in the movie. And this has everyone wondering what this and that song was and where they can buy it since it's not on the soundtrack. This process really sucks. As far as the Vanilla Sky Soundtrack goes it has some good songs on it, but it contains less than half of the songs in the movie.   I suggest that you listen to clips of all the songs on this album and make sure that the songs you want and like from the movie are on it BEFORE you buy it 
 This book is filled with incorrect misleading information on ways to manipulate the human voice to achieve sounds (ie. belting) that are scientifically proven to be damaging. Many of the techniques described in  this book require the physical manipulation of the vocal apparatus, a  process which can lead to undue strain on the vocal folds and surrounding  musculature. Though this books does occassionally contain accurate  information on the process of healthy singing, there is far too much that  is incorrect and poses permanent damage to the voice. The author frequently  contradicts herself  as she explains her process of vocal  "training."  The techniques of this book ask the reader to embark  on an unhealthy and permanently damaging course of vocal study. I recommend  this book only to those wishing to know how NOT to sing 
 I hate to say this since Philosophy is one of my favorite brands, but this is probably the worst mascara I have ever used. It clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove. It does not simply wash off, it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink. About half of them remain attached to your lashes, and I've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara. Everything else I've ever tried from Philosophy was fantastic, but the best mascara out there, hands down, is from Lancome 
 Don't even bother.    I can't think of a single redeeming characteristic here.  I mean, bringing back Jason Todd in those other trades was a bit gimmicky, but at least they're (somewhat) pulling it off.  But this?  Puh-leeze.  I find better plots on cereal boxes.  First of all, the Joker is no crime kingpin.  Never has been.  He's not some connected mafia goon that can get someone like the Riddler sprung from prison "just like that."  He is NOT obsessed with "running Gotham" a la say, Black Mask.  Second of all, the Joker's characterization in the last oh, TWENTY YEARS is such that he is basically an insane, inhuman monster (uhm, killed Jason Todd at the end of the 80s, right?) - not some heartsick fop pining over a dead wife and kid.  Which brings me to the third point: ahem, we DON'T KNOW that the wife-and-kid thing ARE Joker's background; he's CRAZY, remember?  It has never been part of ANY conclusive pantheon.  "Killing Joke" doesn't COUNT as canon, since it's the recollection of a madman who prefers his history as "multiple choice."  Fourth and finally, Hush is a total waste in this story.  His complete APPEAL isn't that he knows Bruce so well, or that he's a great surgeon, or that he can run around so well in all those lame bandages.  NO.  His appeal came (1) you don't know WHO he is (calling him "Tommy" is just plain dumb), since he was NEVER REVEALED at the end of the first "Hush" storyline; (2) he was calm, collected, a chess-player villain who had thought dozens of moves ahead and planned everything meticulously.    Therefore, making him another Two-Face / Killer Croc meets Phantom of the Opera madman flapping about in a lame trench coat and bandages making threats and slugging it out with people just BASTARDIZES the ENTIRE POINT of this guy!  Having him fight the Joker for "control of Gotham" is just lame, lame, LAME.  Neither of them NEVER had interest in this before, so why now?    Besides, Hush was getting the villains to COOPERATE with him AGAINST Batman by tapping their personal foibles / interests / obsessions.  Making him another thug vying for top dog means he's just as dumb as the others!  Gee.  Guess I had a lot to say.  I just hate the fact that such an awesome storyline and character has been so utterly, totally RUINED by some lame marketing department trying to cash in for a buck today that robs them of several thousand they could have made tomorrow with a decent writer 
 The book, "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" is a gross misnomer.  At best, the book should be entitled "A Good Personal Finance Guide".  If a person bought the book, as I did, for expert stock market investment guidance, he/she may likely be highly disappointed.  The book contains very good personal finance guidance, that's all.  Way overstated with the title! 
 I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!  My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!  
 There's plenty of raw energy here, and this would have made a good 50-100 page novella.  Alas, it's 350 pages long! The astonishingly randy protagonists make love three or four times a day, and we hear about it every time, along with what they have for breakfast, how they get dressed (and undressed), etc., etc., etc. The style can be most charitably described as pedestrian.  Sample sentence: "They quickly put the dishes in the dishwasher and zoomed to the theater in Scott's vehicle". And the book (self-published) is full of errors of grammar and spelling.  Annoyingly, this is really just the first half of a book: several themes are introduced (coming out to family and classmates, the homophobic Joe) which apparently get resolved in the so-called sequel, which is really the second half of this book. Maybe I'm just an old grouch.... late teen readers may enjoy this book (and quite a few did, judging from the reviews), but you can do better elsewhere 
 I WAS GIVEN A COPY OF THIS SHOW ,AND WAS HURT TO SEE THE SHOW PUT IN A BACK YARD SETTING,WHICH IS HOW SOME FESTIVALS ARE DONE. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING WITH THESE CATS A FEW TIMES,ON PERCUSSIONS,AND VOCALS. I HAVE TO SAY THIS DVD DOES THEM NO GOOD! I WOULD ALMOST BELIEVE THEY DO NOT KNOW THIS PRODUCT OF THEM IS OUT. I REALLY BELIEVE THIS.IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THEM IN PERSON,DO SO.THERE ARE  DIFFERENT MUSICIANS ,WHICH IF YOU PLAY,KNOW COULD MAKE ,OR BREAK YOU,IN THIS CASE IT BROKE!SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS 
 This brand is just awful!  It's made of cheap, flimsy particle board.  It dents and dings very easily.  Most inportantly, the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out.  Not only is it horribly made, but it's dangerous!  DO NOT BUY! 
 I truly disliked this biography, I thought it was poorly written & researched, melodramatic and frankly dull, given its subject matter.  I struggled to finish it.  Better books for insight into Alexandra are:  "Purple Secret" by John Rohl, et al. for its chapter on Alexandra's complex medical history; Robert Massie's "Nicholas & Alexandra" for its sympathetic understanding of Alix's traumatic childhood loss of her mother, and what it's like to be the parent of a hemophaelic (& despite Massie's inaccuracies, such as stating that Queen Victoria was strongly in favor of the marriage of Nicky & Alix & that she tried to talk Alix into it, when in fact she dreaded it), and, oddly enough, a biography of Alix's mother, "Princess Alice" by Gerard Noel, which gives excellent insight into Alix's parents and German background.  Also, "Advice to My Granddaughter" a collection of letters between Queen Victoria and Alix's oldest sister, Princess Victoria of Battenberg.  There is also "A Lifelong Passion", a collection of letters & diaries of Nicholas & Alexandra and the people around them. Any one of these has more value than Erickson's book.  I have not read Greg King's biography of Alexandra so cannot comment on it.  I've enjoyed Erickson's Tudor biographies, so I'm trying to be fair, but this one didn't cut it 
 I ordered this book at the same time I ordered Win the War Within, by Frank Chilton.  The book by Frank Chilton was much more informative, in depth, and helped us to understand the nutritional information behind our inflammation.  
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 I don't know what's up with all of these 4-5 star reviews. This movie was awful. There was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag. Not even the guest appearances by Afrika Bambataa, Melle Mel, and the Rock Steady Crew could save it. I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The "graffiti" throughout the movie was absolutely awful. Ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair. Guy Davis was fine back then, but not anymore. Rae Dawn Chong was just annoying. This is one movie I never want to see again 
 	Sally Denton's Faith and Betrayal is a disappointing book. It promised all the elements of an exceptionally dramatic (and true) story: love and loss, wealth and poverty, dedication and disillusionment, an epic journey, a peculiar religion, polygamy, theocracy, a massacre, and perhaps betrayal. But Denton's account is so replete with inaccuracies and confusion of facts that it destroys all credibility. Listing her errors would take nearly as many pages as the book itself. In addition she failed to use the richest repository of primary sources of Mormon history-the LDS Church Historical Department Archives. Presumably this is because she assumed she would not be welcome, she believed the records there had been selectively censored, or she thought they would have little relevance.  	As a non-Mormon historian working on the stories of disillusioned converts in the same period of the mid-nineteenth century, I can assure her that for the past decade I have never been refused generous help in the Church Archives and have found the records there amazingly rich, especially the correspondence of Brigham Young and the diaries of contemporaries of those who left the church.  	Denton makes Jean Rio's piano a pivotal issue, which she says was brought to Utah in 1851, though Jean Rio never mentions it in her trip diary nor does the captain of the company she traveled with in his (which is in the Church Archives). Denton fails to give a source for her account of it. It is quite possible Jean Rio ordered the piano later after her arrival in Salt Lake and had it shipped from the East. As for the tar-covered crate (p. 165), if that is in a museum in California, could not have Denton done the research to find where it is?  	Was Jean Rio's piano taken by the church leaders through "consecration"-a rule of stewardship (pp. xvii, 129)? Did Denton bother to inquire in the Church Archives what the consecration records show? Not all records survived, but many did. It is unlikely the church purged them of information about the piano. Likewise, did Denton ever ask the staff at the Museum of Church History and Art about the provenance of the piano? One Jean Rio descendent believes it was gifted to the museum by a Mormon descendant. Here again Denton confuses her facts: She states (p. 130) that the piano is in the "Church Temple Museum"; there is no such institution.  	Denton claims the piano ended up in the "Amelia Palace, the home of Young's favorite wife, a beautiful Englishwoman named Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning..." (p. 129). Here Denton has all too typically confused Young's so-called "favorite" wife Harriet Amelia Folsom with a later wife, Ann Eliza. Neither were English. The Gardo House, the so-called "Amelia's Palace," was not finished until after Brigham Young's death; Amelia lived in it a short period to establish her claim in Young's will, while Ann Eliza never lived there.  	Denton quotes from one of my papers (pp. 153-54), and although the quote is correct, she misinterprets my account, stating "The flow of Mormon defectors had become the largest emigration to that point, far surpassing even the California gold rush." No records can support that idea. Likewise, she claims that "U.S. Army escorts oversaw a burgeoning traffic of disaffected Mormons fleeing Zion." There was only one such escort from Salt Lake of approximately forty families.  	Although a beautifully produced little book, publisher Alfred A. Knopf should be embarrassed at having accepted and published such a consistently unreliable "history." I'm sorry to advise potential readers not to waste their money 
 There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one 
 ....into buying a book that talks about my baby learning to "manipulate me" if I nurse s/he to sleep or hold s/he "too much."  The authors in this book are also obviously not fans of nursing past 12 months OR allowing children to sleep with their parents-two key elements when discussing "attachment Parenting" which, according to Dr. William Sears, sets the ground stage for a happy toddlerhood.  Most of the gentle discipline techniques in this book are worth being reminded of, however, are truly common sense when dealing with a toddler and if are not already part of your daily parenting routine, basic parenting classes should DEFINATELY be a priority. Of course, no book can emphasize enough that hitting/slapping/spanking is inappropriate discipline (and this book does a great job of that), but I feel if you are reading this book you probably already know that and are looking for better answers.  I recommend "Kids are Worth It" by Barbara Coloroso instead. Most of the gentle discipline techniqes parallel each other in a reading environment that gives more confidence in parental lifestyle choice. Also, "The Discipline Book" by the Sears' is a definite keeper 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 As an enthusiast of the Hilliard Ensemble, I was greatly disappointed by this early music / jazz "cross-over" album. Jan Garbarek's feeble sax noodling does nothing to illuminate the Ensemble's choral polyphony, which fades into the background of this badly mixed recording. If you are interested in exploring the sacred music of the Middle Ages or Renaissance, don't start here... check out the Hilliard Ensemble's "Codex Specialnik" album 
 The movie?  Awesome.  The DVD?  Another Disney rip-off.  Touted as a two-disc special edition all the way through the packaging of the Cinderella two-disc special edition, Disney silently changed its mind and charged an outrageous price for a single disc.  Even the coupon inside the Cinderella DVD said that this would be a two-disc.  Why did Disney change its mind last minute?  No official word (and no apology when I complained), but you can bet the answer starts with a dollar sign 
 In response to the reviewer below that is alleging people were being "abusive" to Fisher, I think he didnt read the book.  I did and honestly I think these reviwers were being rather kind.  If anything, given what we know some six years later since the publication of the book now and in light of greater advances in brain imaging and neuroscience, where it is not speculation as Fisher was gambling on, but rather real data and science, women are not the "holistic" or "integrative" or whatever synonymous term you can think to describe "multitasking."  This idea that women are inherently superior in "multitasking" has been around for a while and I think lots of women really buy into it.  Sure there are some women that can multitask but most suck at it and even those that can do it, you notice a marked depreciation of the quality of the output.    There is more than very strong evidence to support that men have a superior ability of integrating disparate information and focus more clearly for a longer time on a complex tasks.  This is one of the reasons why men out perform women in math and science.  As for multitasking, look at the most successful women out there today.  From being CEOs to running home spun businesses, while still feminine and women, these women's winning attributes are those more traditionally held and accredited to men.  Consider for exmaple the self-made millionaire, author and personal-finance guro Suze Ozman.  In the January 16, 2006 issue of Time magazine (page 76), she writes: "I, more than anyone else I've met, do not believe in multitasking."  She continues to say: "I believe it is the ruination of the perfection of a project."  As for this idea being so ingrained into the minds of many women that many think they can yap like twits on their cell phones while driving and rounding a bend, never noticing she just went through a red light and then coming to a screching halt when she suddenly encounters a pedestrian who had the audacity to be in the princess's precious path.  I've seen this exact thing and similar incidents for it to be coincidental, and in fact the premiums for insurance has steadily gone up for women, as they have also steadily accounted for more and more accents.  So much for Fisher's claim of women's "superioer" multitasking abilities.  All the main themes of Fisher's book, central being that women are naturally inclined to be multitasking and it is an advantage in the information age, is deeply flawed, as women cannot multitask better than men nor is it really an advantage since work quality and attention declines.  People often have to repeat or go back to remind themselves what they've done.  Productivity goes greatly down.    And what has all the supposed "superioty" or women as Fisher claims gotten women?  She is still an untenured researcher who despite closing in on retirement age doesn't hold a profressorship and still refers to herself as "single."  Well that is a bit flattering, but the truth is she is a bitter pseudo-academic hack that is attempting to assuage her own personal shortcomings by having had invented a genuinely preposterous narrative of superiority of women that can now overcome the evil dark "patriarch," the great scapegoat of all that went wrong for women like Fisher.  It just never occurred to Fisher her failures are not all of womens nor do to men having supposedly held her and her "sisters" back.  The reason is that she was born a twit and now is a menopausal twit with a serious ax to grind and desperately trying to live vicariously through others, especially younger women like some sad, agin, pathetic Ms. Havisham.  How could anyone have respect for her and this laughable "work" of "scholarship?"    Please enough already with this crap.  These old female farts like Fisher just need to accept their only rightful place: under the rest of the highly successful men and women that Fisher can only observe and burn with bitter jealousy for not being one of them.  Young people must have these kinds of old, jaded, angry twits (men included) exposed for what and who they are and seen for all their underlying malice covered with a primrose patina of psuedo-science and operating under the false rubric of a concern for "equality" as Fisher alleged in this book.  No, the reviewers were being most kind indeed for skirting around what was at heart behind this book, even though I doubt it was lost to most readers.  She is just a sad creature and the only thing more flattering than her own vain view of herself is her having received these reviews, albeit it resoundedly negative.  The only legacy that this "woman" will have are these books, possessing no namesakes or offspring.  And even there, as already has happened, these books will pass to the wayside, disposed and forgotten as real progress marches forward.       
 This is the 2nd one of these we purchased in the last 18 months.  This one began to skip after 2 weeks.  The first one worked for over a yea

 I had read The Borrowers in a magazine installment with my Great Grandmother. Then, I could hardly wait for the next month's magazine installment to arrive. I then reread the books with my daughter [who is now 32 years old] when she was about 12 years old. We wanted to share this DVD of The Borrowers with her son, my 4 year old grandson. That is why I purchased this item. We FORCED ourselves to watch almost half of the DVD, and then we all said, "Yes, let's shut it off." And we haven't watched any more of it. This new version is very contrived, with not much connection to the original story! I would like to perhaps buy a copy of the old original version sometime, but this version has soured me for a while on The Borrowers 
 After reading a couple of other reviews about the "quality" of transfer on this dvd, I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what little color that is desplayed. Almost a black & white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and "suppossedly" in Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this "Goodtimes Video" version untill it is put on dvd correctly. Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 This a good book for those who have yet to venture in the zoo of the personal medical investigation.  However, for those hoping for more specific help in the MS specifics of identification MS, solutions, and who to see it --this book does fall short 
 The Book from Alex Haley when I read it some 10 years ago changed my life and views of people with color, and everyone should read it, yes even conservatives, manditory.    however, this movie something just wasnt good.   to long?  the over all acting?    Spike, you make some great movies, Summer of Sam is one of your best, Do the Right Thing. Spike has a gift for cinematography, however   Spike Lee Interview on ESPN? The interview said,   interviewer:  "Kanye West said that Bush doesn't care about black people. Would you agree with that?   Lee:  "Yes, I agree with that, BUT I'll go one step further and say that Bush doesn't care about people who don't have any money (whether they're black or white.) I guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on Long Island or let's say The Hamptons, you would have had an entirley different response from FEMA and his administration."   But you should have seen how he said it, it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face. The dude is bold man, I'll give him that and I applaude him.   Spike said either black, white, Mexican, or asian.  But what he DIDN'T say was Italians!!   That dude has been getting flack forever for his dis'n of Italians in his movies, they call him a racist all the time.   HERE WAS HIS CHANCE to say something, and he blew it.   just didn't happen to say Italians?   NO  So HE is a racist too.   And so are the Africans in Africa, they never have liked white people either, so what about that Spike? Try going over their and applying for a job!   And while I am at, the African Americans in even Baton Rouge don't want the blacks from N.O. coming up their! How come spike never said anything about that?   Fkn whiners, so many the world over! give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on TV and let the world see it for the fools they are.   And ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling Da Truth  
 Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning. I'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again. Only a couple bucks, but definitely not worth it 
 I can't find anything good to say about this book. I used to be a huge fan of Block's work but now a lot of it makes me cringe. This is her newest book and I received it as a Christmas gift. The plot sounded good in theory (Greek Myths modernized) but I should have known better. There's barely any book here. It's a very slim 116 pages and it's written in a "poetic" style that means each page of text barely has any text on it. It took me less than an hour to read it and I was confused for a lot of it. Half the time I didn't know which character was telling the story - what little story there was to be told. The little blurb describing the book is almost longer than the book itself. I know that I probably would have loved this back in high school (or at the very least pretended to love it) when I was obsessed with Block's work but now? I can honestly say that I threw it down in disgust when I was finished and wished I could have gotten that hour back. I really don't recommend this book to anyone who isn't a teenage girl obsessed with Block's work. 
 I've been well aware of Mr. Ledeen and his international criminal endeavors for years now.  But only recently did I decide to take a look into the mind of this madman.   Honestly, this is just a terrible read overall.  Even forgetting the factual errors already listed, it's clear that Mr. Ledeen (who has never worn a military uniform that I'm aware of) is a naturally born arm chair general.  When he takes time to mock Bill Clinton for looking to avoid large military casualties on his watch, I find myself both amused and horrified at the same time.  Additionally, his analogy of a football coach telling his players to try not to get hurt is ludicrous.   Most troubling of all is Mr. Ledeen's rant towards the Bush 1 administration on page 28.  Here Ledeen lauds the former President and Colin Powell (never mentioning then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney)  for not going straight to Baghdad in the first Gulf War.  Taking into account that this was written in the late 90's, it's hard not to scratch your head when he writes off notions of The US being "mired in a Vietnamlike swamp," had we invaded on a massive level in 1991.  For those of you keeping score at home, that's exactly what DID happen.  Just substitute swamp with urban warfare.  This is a great read for those who still blindly support the war in Iraq and wish to generate some factually challanged talking points.  However, if you're more rooted in reality, you'll find very little to cling to in these pages.  
 I nearly stopped reading just before the capstone section, where 10 hostages, walled up in a cell, one by one make declarations for posterity before being overcome by nerve gas. I found the book had just become completely implausible.  The characters are intricately drawn, but they are set in a plot that well before that scene is a charade of coincidences. Too many preposterous things happening make any character seem like a cardboard cutout.  What really got me about the gas was that nerve gas exposure, even in mild amounts, makes one restive, excitable, and confused; yet eight out of 10 characters are able to dictate their last words gently and carefully, in cohesive monologues, before succumbing.  The reason why this bothers me is that the author has written a sophisticated book that shows you how terrorists and corrupt spies express their humanity and how the terrible damage that they wreak is played out in the souls of those who were spared. A well-researched and plausible plot grounds the reader in the characters' reality. An outlandish plot renders the characters' actions incomprehensible, because the reader has lost her identification with what the characters would do in that situation. I wonder what would happen if I had lost my parents in a fatal hijacking, as had two of "Due Preparations"' characters; sadly, this implausible novel does not help me answer that question 
 Two big problems with this DVD player.  One, based on experience I stupidly assumed all DVD players display elapsed time while playing disks.  This one just shows the track number.  If you want to know how much of a movie you've watched (to mentally calculate how much is left) you're out of luck.  Two, this thing STINKS for playing music.  Regardless of how your CD is encoded, it will pause two seconds between EVERY TRACK . . . which can be irritating when you're playing a CD of allegedly-continuous music, like an opera or the White Album or Dark Side of the Moon.  I called Toshiba to ask about this, and they were confirmed this.  They said ALL Toshiba DVD players pause between music tracks, and that basically I was stuck.  So, I'm warning you, and frankly I think they should print a warning on every box.  (Something like "Won't play music properly!  Just going to make you mad!")  And I'm not buying Toshiba again 
 This book calls itself an "urban historical" and I can see why they didn't want to be specific about that and add a NOUN to this adjectival phrase. Is it a novel? Is it an account of Walker's life? Neither, it seems. It is a weird juxtaposition of fact and fiction--and you can't tell what's fact and what's fiction. No notes or anything. Give this one a pass--even if you want an impressionistic account of Harlem Renaissance life. You'd be much better off looking at photos 
 Wells is a wonderful writer, it is true; however, his bigotry and hatred of certain peoples and of religion is very apparent. His political leanings are also too apparent--it is not an unbiased book and may give some the wrong impression of world events. I am currently reading the book updated just after WWII 
 This is a messy book that succeeds (to the degree that it does so) despite its flaws.  Some of the subjects are covered well, some covered poorly, and even where there is coverage, the discussions are maddeningly inconsistent.  First, the good: author Otto Friedrich was energetic in finding many former residents of Berlin as sources for this work, and some of the best parts of the book are their colorful reminiscences of their lost and ruined city.  Friedrich also included interesting chapters about the social milieu of the time, particularly the cultural scene: classical music, drama and the nascent motion picture industry.  And there are some nice character sketches of some of the leading artists of the era: Lotte Lenya, Bertolt Brecht and various musicians.  In general, despite the crazy-quilt nature of the coverage, Friedrich is best on the social history aspects of Berlin.  Now, the bad:  The book is very scattershot, a mile wide, but mostly an inch deep.  For example, in the discussion of the German movie industry of the time, although Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings are discussed, Peter Lorre, Ernst Lubistch and F.W. Murnau are discussed only in passing.  Among the pictorial artists, George Grosz is covered and discussed, but Becker, Nolde and scores of other artists get superficial or non-existent coverage.  And maybe it is inevitable to try to discuss the tangled political history of the Weimar era and the rise of the Nazis in a history of Berlin, but Friedrich is not a professional historian, and his weaknesses in this area are glaring.  Any reader with even a passing interest in the Weimar era will find far better accounts of the politics of the period than Friedrich's book. And even if you grant that he needed to discuss the political events of the day in  his work, there's a lamentable lack of focus to his political coverage, which mirrors the overall unevenness of this work.  For example, his descriptions of the combat in the streets between the Freikorps and the Communists in the immediate post-war period have the freshness and vitality that come from the testimony of eyewitnesses, and they give the reader a sense for the chaos that became horrifyingly prevalent in Berlin.  But his discussion of Germany's policies toward the payment of reparations (the Dawes plan and the Young plan, etc.) is, at best, superficial and misleading.  If you read this book, you might consider reading the sections that deal with the social history of the period and just skipping (or finding better sources for) the political history. 
 Noting that Instapundit's Glenn Reynolds linked to this book on his blog, and respecting the good professor as the blogosphere's most trenchant commentator, I expected Dog Days to be bold, edgy, or in some way irreverent. Regrettably, I found nothing at all distinctive about it.  Indeed, it has a humdrum,  so-last-year feel to it -- as exemplified by the author's obsessive focus on the main character's fetishizing of her blackberry as though it were a hot new gizmo.  Similarly,  the plot so barely fictionalizes people and events that have already received massive coverage (Washingtonienne Jessica Cutler, the 2004 Kerry and Bush campaigns) that I was left bemoaning the author's lack of imagination. Cox does write the occasional witty and sardonic repartee for her two leads, but I agree with an earlier Amazon reviewer's comment that the book feels like a rush-job and is substantially devoid of the clever thinking and writing so emblematic of today's most popular bloggers.            
 First, I think I should tell you that this book and another of Steve Russo's " What's the Deal with Wicca" is The SAME BOOK but with passages rearranged.   Secondly as a Wiccan for over two decades, presumably I would know all about my religion. Russo does not diffentiate between the various Pagan groups, Wicca and " witchcraft". I think he makes no distinction deliberately.  On the surface the book(s) looks semi- well researched, but a more informed reader can see that is a mask for the same old " all other religions are decepttions of satan" stuff that books attacking Wicca and the occult in the 1980s spewed out from Christian publishing houses.  The sanctimonious arguments that Wicca has no real values, we worship the creation not the creator, ad nauseum shows a pretense of knowledge but more of the author's own biases than anything objective.  Russo's biases and Bible-'rationalized" intolerance shows through no matter how much he tries to sweeten it. And, like in many " arguments" for comversion, Russo cheats. If you are a parent cocnerned about your teen involed in Wicca, this book is NOT the one you should read. " When Someone You Love is Wiccan" by Carl McColman is far more informantive, unbiased, and the author is not trying to decieve you to uphold his own biases 
 This is the worst, most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.  There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while, their actions just become inexplicable.  The author's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.  It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman's darkness or one of his minions.  Additionally, the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands, nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.  What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.  Unlike some of Stephen King's work (ie: The Stand), there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.  It's evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.  All I can say is that this book is ugly, ugly, ugly.  At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness, but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.  The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for  him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.  I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence, I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author's work again.  It's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist, Dave McKean, who maybe hasn't completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has.  His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened-up the book--and maybe a little because the title intrigued me.  But it's unfortunate that the industry rewards "clever" works such as Mr. Gaiman's with undue praise.  I've never so strongly disliked a book.  Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book?  Well, don't believe the hype, this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X-men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you 
 I used this printer to do 6 pictures it did 3 good and started the 4th blurry and all the rest just ink blobs, the  printer works for printing but the pictures stink, thats putting it mildly!!!A waste  of money 
 The first cd was fantastic.  Great upbeat songs. The new one is slow and depressing.  If I didn't know better, I would swear it was a completely different band.  I went from loving these guys to wishing I hadn't spent the money on the second cd. Very disappointing follow up 
 It just doesn't work that well.  These skits are so obviously the C- versions or "nevermind" sketches that they never would have made it on the air if they were surrounded by the A+ material of previous seasons.  These episodes admittedly house several giggle-able moments and even some great stuff (I, too, very much enjoy the Tupac song), but the quality is under par, far under what one would expect even from an unfinished project like this one.  I recommend seeing them, just because they're funny enough to be worth the time to watch them, but also because it does provide some closure for those of us who have been attached to Chappelle's Show at the hip for a couple of years 
 I purchased both this title and "The Insider's Guide to Real Estate Investing Loopholes" (same authors).  I have two primary complaints.  The authors talk down to the reader, constantly making snarky comments that imply that if one doesn't act NOW, the reader is lazy, or paralyzed, or is somehow inept when it comes to business.  That's not just annoying -- it's weird, and it made me suspicious of the authors' motives.  That brings me to my second complaint.  The book lacks balance.  I'm not saying that all of the strategies can't work -- just that it requires an ideal set of market conditions for them to work.  We need to see low or declining interest rates, quickly rising tenant incomes, improving neighborhoods, distressed or at least disinterested sellers, few other investors, low insurance costs, and a plethora of service providers (such as roofers) who do great work at a low price very quickly.  I can tell you that we don't have any of those factors at work now.  What we do have, at least in areas like mine, where appreciation has outpaced incomes, is a market turned on its head.  Sellers will not sell because they are sitting on huge profits for the most part, and don't have to sell.  Or, they believe that prices will appreciate at the same ridiculous rate that they did from 2001-2005.  Numerous Dolf-inspired investors have flooded the market and bid prices up beyond all reason.  Workers are in debt and don't have much money for rent.  Neighborhoods where deals are affordable aren't improving, so the idea of refinancing because you painted and put up a new mailbox won't help you.  Easy mortgage money has gotten anyone with a pulse into homes.  Interest rates are rising, not falling.  Insurance is costly and the coverage stinks.  And most importantly, rents do not provide positive cash flow for most small real estate investors.  I know several who actually consider themselves to be successful and the news is not good.  They are carrying their properties, their properties are not carrying them!  I know, it's hard to believe that this is success.  But in the past few years, appreciation has bailed them out.  Put that kind of leverage into effect and you are leveraging a negative, which only means you go broke faster.  A few observations:  First, if making untold riches were this simple and this obvious, then so many people would attempt to do so that it would suck the potential profit from such deals down until the actual profit is more equivalent to the amount of work involved.  (More about this in a moment -- because I believe that this is actually occuring in part due to all of the real estate evangelism going on.)  As they say on Wall Street:  "When enough people find the key to the market, someone changes the lock!"  I believe that most people reading this review are smart enough to know that markets are dynamic.  Outrageous profits bring in a flood of new entrants, dramatically reducing the profit potential.  If a whole bunch of new wannabe real estate tycoons start lining up to bid on properties, then the prices for those properties will rise, as will the price for the money (the financing charges in the form of interest rates).  Even without a lot of new entrants, if enough people start using the same financial techniques of leverage, cost-benefit analysis, or tax strategies, then the advantages to be gained will be reduced commensurately.  Common sense and basic real-world economics dictate that costs will rise and potential profits will fall.  And so it is in the real estate world.  Economies of scale and technological advancements have changed many industries and wiped out others.  The ability for a small business person to get a competitive bid on anything is severely limited, whether you are talking about insurance, waste collection, land, communication services, landscaping, or anything else.  Big players have the advantage in negotiations and will consistently be able to lower their costs below that a single investor.  They can offer their tenants more amenities and constantly remodel and update their units at a far lower cost than you or me.  I can't start a profitable shipbuilding company or TV network, nor can I jump into owning large buidings over which I can spread my costs enough to justify what is increasingly becoming break-even or negative cash flow from tenants.  I am not saying that there will never again be opportunities for small real estate investors to use leverage and tax advantages to make decent money.  Just that, with so many of your fellow investors looking to do the same thing, you are not going to find (DEEP BREATH HERE!): underpriced positive cash-flowing properties in undervalued neighborhoods with great potential on which you can quickly close at a dynamite interest rate that result in quickly-rented units with stable, high-earning tenants who are happy to stick around so you can quickly refinance at "massively increased property valuation" (Dolf's expression) so you can pay yourself and your investors back, raise rents even higher and go on to the next property with similar ideal parameters, plunk 10% down and do the same thing.  And no, I'm not an unmotivated individual who works harder than I have to, doesn't understand the value of money, or doesn't want financial freedom.  We all want that.  In Dolf's world, there are numerous individuals who can't wait to to sell you $100 for $50.  My question is, if he knows how to get people to do that, why he is telling us about it?  I think we all know the answer to this question.  Don't get me wrong:  Eventually, the property marketplace will right itself and investment properties will come up that offer opportunity to even small investors, even with the odds stacked against you.  However, it won't unlock some kind of magical door to riches.  It will simply be one of many investments that helps you build LONG-TERM wealth.  Real estate is just another business that goes through cycles and isn't necessarily any more of a path to fabulous riches than owning a chain of gas stations or making molded plastic products.  By the way, the most successful real estate investment firms in America have had a total return about 23% annually for the past five years through March 31, 2006.  That includes dividends and share price appreciation.  If that's the BEST they can do, (and I'm not saying it's bad...it's actually an amazing performance!), it's  because that's the BEST anyone can hope to do, including you and me.  Remember, these firms use all the leverage they can muster and have tremendous economies of scale, and the smartest tax accountants and attorneys working on their behalf.  We are highly unlikely to see this performance repeated in real estate for the next five years or possibly, ever.  Footnote:  I recently studied single family homes in Broward County and Palm Beach County, Florida.  Over the past thirty-five years, not including taxes of any kind, residential properties have enjoyed an average annual return of 9.25% per year.  Short-run performance tends to regress towards the mean.  Therefore, we are virtually assured that real estate will come nowhere close to its recent performance over the next several years, particularly in a higher-interest rate environment with lots of new supply.  Buyer beware 
 Hard to reference simple grammer rules, e.g., how to use quotaion marks.  Too much information on how to document computer language.  Not what I expected and not what I want...can I return this book 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 Pygmalion centers on a woman who cannot speak to save her life. She is the most interesting of the three main characters but also the worst to focus on. She is boring to the point of tears. She is poor, hungry, and happy. It is a typical underdog story where two rich and powerful men who happen to be specialists in her area of need -language-happen upon her in a gloomy British rain. Surprised? I was not. Shaw cut right to the point; after all, it is a short play. I do not blame Shaw for making it short, more of Higgins and I would have put the play down.  Should we try to pinpoint why the two men, more so Higgins, decide to tutor and to change Eliza, we come across purely selfish motives. Eliza sells flowers on the street in order to feed herself, and later goes to Higgins to learn proper English in order to become a shop-owner. Higgins wants to change her into a proper girl in order to prove that he is the greatest linguistics tutor, also, to win a bet...how egocentric. Selfish acts drive this play along. Here, the class struggle also comes into play as Eliza must not only refrain from using the only language she knows, but must change the way in which she holds herself in front of society. Shaw wrote Eliza's character very precisely to have individual dignity and determination to help her achieve her goals. The one thing I liked.  The play is about adaptation and transformation. Eliza's incredible strength moves the play along more quickly despite Higgins' pompous attitude slowing it down. Then again, without the diametrically opposed characters the play would not work.   Interesting class struggle and realistic language effort but overall, just a so-so read. Shaw has a good point: it takes effort to move up to bourgeoisie. He has all the right characters: a poor, pretty girl with a desire to learn, a snotty old Professor who is full of himself and a rich gentleman to provide the budget. Unfortunately, and perhaps due to the year I was born, the generation I grew up in and my penchant for sex and scandal, I found it rather dry. I am glad I read it, but will likely not pick it up again.  
 This kit is absolutely horrible.  First off, the scratch-free cloths it comes with aren't scratch-free at all. They totally scratch the CD.   The "Step 1: Scratch Removal" is not scratch removal at all. It is supposed to sit for 5 minutes, then you wipe it. I let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still there.   After you apply that junk, the instructions say to apply "Step 2: Cleaner,Polisher, and Sealer". This stuff is practically water. It doesn't work AT ALL.  After you do that the CD should be like new. I don't think so!  The holder that you put the CD on while you're cleaning it is too flimsy.  The only good thing that I use the "Scratch Remover" for is small scratches on my digital camera, cell phone, PSP, and other electronics.   Do not buy this unless you like ruining CD's.   Last Word: I hate Maxell. 
 This is such a condesending book about "Middle America."   The characters seem like the creation of a Harvard undergrad who thinks that mid west rubes are just so darn cute and earthy. Yuck

 I found this book to be too wordy.  Theorems are sometimes stated without proofs then followed by several corollaries with proof, followed finally by the proof of the original theorem.  Allusions are made to geometry  unfamiliar to some learning the basics of commutative ring theory.  A nice  book to come back to 
 	I read this book on the recommendation of two close friends - both of whom are retired English teachers - and both of whom should have known better.  It is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Although other reviewers have commented on some of the same things, I think the book is so bad they bear repeating. 	The characters are so thinly drawn as to be stick figures.  The ambitious young professional woman, the used-up poet turned to drink, the insecure young wife, and the brother who main functions seem to be the guy who brings the boat and to be the near recipient of a "quickie on the rocks."  Who could possibly care about any of them?  Without anyone to care about, the author has no chance of developing suspense and eliciting an emotional response from her readers.  	Switching back and forth between two stories in alternating chapters can work as a plot device, but its success depends upon the two stories being brought together in some convincing fashion at the end.  This doesn't happen, and as if that's not enough, the present day chapters are further split by references to the 1873 murder scattered throughout them.  Clumsy and distracting are the best things one can say about the plot development. 	Even though this is a novel, its characters should behave within the scope of believable human actions.  Asking your husband when he first met the woman you suspect he may be having an affair with is believable; asking him the question when you're in the midst of trying to save yourself and family members in a violent storm at sea is not.  There are other examples of forced dialogue, but this is among the most outrageous. 	Lastly, subtlety is obviously not Ms. Shreve's long suit.  The androgynously named child, Billie, is the only one to suffer the consequences of everyone else's failings.  Gee, is this really the death of innocence?  It's about as nuanced as the murderer's ax on Smuttynose.  And how about the danger of  humorless puritans in the face of  real or supposed sexual variations?  Who would have thought it?   	So why has the book been as popular as it is?  It appeals to the world view of certain young moderns:  Sex is the driving force behind all human actions, the brooding woman is the most fascinating creature in view, and a civility devoid of human feeling is to be prized.     	The Norwegian characters in the historical murder prompt one last reaction.   In downtown Oslo is the Vigelund Sculpture Park.  It is populated with the large and brooding sculptures of Gustav Vigelund, a local sculptor whose work is appreciated almost nowhere else on earth.  If one spends anytime there, one comes away gloomy, perplexed, and with the certain knowledge that an afternoon has been wasted.  Save yourself the expense of a trip to Norway - read The Weight of Water instead 
 WOW! Bad book. I gave this book one star because it felt good to end the pain. If you want lots of cult facts this isnt the book for you. If you want a not very enjoyable read....READ THIS!  What was the author thinking when she wrote this. It wasnt cool it wasnt funny it was bad. 
 Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the "repair" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?  
 The book is well written, but the way the author romanticizes ancient people living in California and demonizes its modern inhabitants puts me off.   I do not mind an author's biases creeping in his writing but then he should be able to carry if off with readers who dont disagree with him. For example, I read Reisner's Cadillac Desert which is a totally biased commentary on California's water and I rarely agreed with his viewpoint, but he puts it in such an interesting manner that it makes good reading nevertheless and I loved that book. The author of this book not only makes preposterous statements (for example, saying that the Indian inhabitants of America lived lives in harmony in nature because they were wiser than us) but makes them without constructing a strong intellectual platform that might engage someone who thinks differently.  Any new information the book provides is lost in the lengthy and tedious literary style that the author adopts. I am a fairly keen reader, and I must say that I dozed off reading this book more often than with others of this genre 
 i wanna like anita baker...but the problem here is that all of her songs sound the same.rapture of love,just because,sweet love,No One in the World,You Bring Me Joy etc etc etc...whats the difference lol.plus her vocal delivery pretty much stays the same.and lets be honest here her voice is an aquired taste (or at least to me it is).seriously her voice sounds like somethings lodged down her throat.but if i must say one good thing about anita baker is that her voice and production goes well and floats great togeather and has a smooth mellow quality to them.so if i'm stuck on a island with just her music i wouldn't mind....at first but after a week on that island i would become bored to tears.but this is probably a personal preferance than a actual critique i guess.  i think you're better off with sade's best of compilation instead.while sade's voice might also be considered an aquired taste she still has something that anita baker doesn't.and that secret weapon is her awesome band headed by Stuart Mathewman (guitar and saxophone),Paul S. Denman (bass),Andrew Hale (keyboards),Paul Cook (drums).these guys also helped with maxwell's albums.and they tend to switch up their sound from time to time.  but if your a hardcore anita fan than this is perfect for you 
 I had this one in high school.  I remember loving it.  After purchasing it, I realized it wasn't as good as I remembered it being.  Granted, it has brought back quite a few memories, but I don't really know if they're really worth remembering.  It's up to you, buy it if you want 
 President Ulysses Grant called the 1846 U.S. invasioin of Mexico, "the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation."  I see whatever piece of the "American Dream" that immigrants (legal or not) get from coming here as a sort of reparations for all the harm our military empire has caused other nations.  Pat Buchanan has said, "if people don't want terrorism, we have to give up our empire."  I think he's right, I'd just add that the same goes for immigration.  To curb the influx of economic refugees, we have to reform NAFTA, end the exploitative behavior of transnationals (many US-based) in the maquilladoras, support Fair Trade, end the dirty work of places like the School of the Americas and figures like "Economic Hit Men," and so forth.  Moreover, Wooldridge and others often speak as if the "Minute Men" are the only civic group working on the issue of immigration.  Thankfully, there are groups like the American Friends Service Committee and Border Links that have a much more intelligent analysis of migration, and far more humane approaches to this complex issue.  As General Smedley Butler said, "war is a racket," and that includes this war on immigrants.  There is a lot of money that is being made from the building of a high-tech fence, aerial drones, motion sensors, videocameras, detention centers, and the other equipment of a police state.  If we let that industry grow because of one scare or another . . . well, we won't recognize this country as the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Rather than Wooldridge's fear and resentment-mongering, I'd recommend the upcoming boook by Free Speech Radio News host, Deepa Fernandes, which is titled, "Targeted: Homeland Security and the Business of Immigration."  We could also learn a lot by listening to the leaders of Mexico's own movements for justice.  There are many books and DVDs available regarding the courageous efforts of the Zapatistas.  "I would rather die on my feet, than live a lifetime on my knees."  -Emiliano Zapata 
 I bought this based on the previous reviews. The book is very thin in content with about 250 cards per exam in the boook itself. It does not nearly cover the needed information.  The CD is better with more flash cards per exam, and a testing engine, but still thin in coverage and explanations.  It has information you can use, but not enough. If it was structured toward the exam requrements it would have been better. If you used the other Cisco press books, you don't need this, not even at the discounted price.  As a comparison, the CCNA flash cards book was much better. 
 If you read the dedication, you understand why she wrote this book.  However, she has placed too much emphasis on her agenda, and that really distracts from the hetero relationship of the book.  Like another reviewer below, I love her books, but don't think this is her best romance novel.  I really didn't care about either person in the hetero relationship, and was far too distracted by the other relationship in the book.  I understand that she may want to promote understanding and compassion for gay relationships, but I don't read romance novels to get schooled in liberal thought (and didn't need an education in broadmindedness).  I read them for hot, steamy hetero couples.  Frankly, I didn't like the setting for this one (a movie stage), either.  The last time she did a book based on acting/the stage ("Heart Throb"), I was equally unimpressed.  I thought the male lead was wimpy, which is why I'm such a fan of the Seal books she has done.  This Seal book is definitely a let-down 
 This works just fine but the picture is so small that it gave me a headache after 45 minutes of viewing. Not for those susceptible to migraines. Also, it goes through batteries like a rabid raccoon goes through a dumpster. Mine lasted 2 hours. This may only be good for kids or sports nuts who can't be away from their tvs 
 Pros: it's really cheap, and has a lot of features (set stride length, calories, clock, backlight, protective door)  Con: the door is really, incredibly, intolerably hard to open.  I was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open.  I tried to trim the plastic tab, but I took too much off, now the door flops open.  It was useless the way it came from the factory, now I broke it and can't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed. Also, I was never able to get a very accurate step-count.  I would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout, though I'm not really sure because I had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open.  For the price, I think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it 
 I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.  Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do? 
 This book is stacked with lore.  Nice for a light read, but if you are looking for a really useful book with practical information (and less superstition), pass this one by. 
 This review book is not up to date, specifically the questions are in a format nowhere near USMLE's exam.  Memorize the newest edition of First Aid 
 There aren't that many patterns overall, and there are too many with adornments. I only found about a handful, like three or four that I would want to make. 
 There is some interesting information here, but ultimately much of this book is simply a history of African-American athletics, which is not exactly obvious from the book's title.  Hey, I'm as interested in the story of Jack Johnson as the next guy, but does the treatment he received really belong in this book?  Given that the book weighs in at 400 pages, you've got to wonder what his editor was thinking about some of these anecdotes.  On another note, I'm tired of seeing Tiger Woods be referred to as a "black golfer."  For the record, Tiger is 1/2 Asian, 1/4 black, 1/8 white and 1/8 Native American.  Why does his black ancestry somehow trump the other 75% of his heritage?  
 DO NOT GET THIS BOOK, I ORDERED IT ALONG WITH FRETBOARD LOGIC AND THIS BOOK PALES IN COMPARISON, HE ALSO SPEAKS AS IF YOU ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING HE IS TALKING ABOUT WHICH ALOT OF BEGINNERS WILL HAVE NO CLUE OF. HIS EXPLANATION OF THE F-D-A ROADMAP IS PATHETIC COMPARED TO THE CAGED EXPLANATION IN BILL EDWARDS FRETBOARD LOGIC. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOR AND GET FRETBOARD LOGIC 1,2 AND 3INSTEAD 
 I purchased the 8 X 10 Photo Frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter.  I was able to get the product running and to load a 'test' set of pictures, but the product then 'froze' at the startup screen.  I checked the Pacific Digital support website, which provided steps (basically, a sequence of buttons to hold down) to 'unfreeze' and reinitialize the unit.  I tried this sequence several times, to no avail, and then called Pacific Digital customer service.  After repeated messages left on a voice mail system ("we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back to you") at all times of the day and night, I was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned.  Long story short - our wedding came and went, the problem was never (and will apparently never be) resolved, and the Digital Photo Frame is now a $390 paperweight.  Absolutely useless.  My recommendation: DO NOT PURCHASE A PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCT.  This is clearly a fly-by-night outfit 
 I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY WOULD ANYONE LIKE THIS AWFUL BAND.BON JOVI WERE JUST A BOY BAND WITH GUITARS.ALL THEIR ALBUMS SUCK.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. GET ALBUMS FROM GREAT BANDS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,PINK FLOYD AND THE ROLLING STONES INSTEAD 
 When I am sick, I don't want to wade through this book at all......there are many mistakes. I had the shock of my life recently.....I had a mild cold and took the standard remedies given by my herbal "doctor". I didn't get better and got very sick almost to the point of being in the hospital. Luckily, my family medical doctor treated me and also prescribed a potent Rx.  Within 24 hours I felt much better! None of the alternate treatments and herbal medicines worked at all! The bill from the herbal "doctor" and all the medicines and treatments he gave me was MORE than the visit to my Family medical doctor and his treatments !!!!! Thanks Doc 
 De Soto's work was viewed by economists, historians, and politicians alike as breakthrough.  He gives us an in-depth look at the Lima's informal sector and postulates, much to the satisfaction of his Washington, D.C.  bankroll, that Peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market  capitalism.  Unfortunately, he has twisted Peru's real scenario to reflect  what Washington wants to hear.  In reality, Lima's informal sector is  merely a way for a depraved population to survive, not a radical shift  toward capitalism.  De Soto's Institue for Liberty and Democracy was funded  almost in full by Washington, and the man himself has spent more time in  the U.S. than in Peru.  This book leans more toward American propaganda  than objective analysis.  An interesting read, but only with abundant  grains of salt 
 This dialogue was PAINFUL to read.  My 9 year-old Goddaughter can write better dialogue in her stories that this stuff!  Luckily, I only paid 75 cents for the book at a clearance book sale.  Save your money.  Turns out this book wasn't even worth the 75 cents I paid for it!  
 Two things wrong with the product.  1) The speaker actually gives feedback when the microphone is too close.  The unfortunate thing is the microphone stand is close and cord to the mic is short so you just get this constant feedback.  It's a high-pitched loud shrilly noise that made my daughter cry immediately.  2) I assumed because of the playback fuctionality it included playback of what you're singing into the microphone.  That's not the case.  It only plays back the tune you play on the piano.  
 If you could do one thing better than GOD, would you still believe?...............  I would like you to imagine for a moment, a mother's love. I think we can all agree, the bond between a mother and child is one of the strongest bonds known to mankind, in any time or culture. Now imagine you are the mother of two children. One boy and one girl, their ages are unimportant.  Got the image in your head? Great, now imagine one child is always a troublemaker, quite a little heathen if you will. The child never listens to anything you say, gets in trouble at school, and even sometimes says they hate you. Child number two, is a perfect little angel, always does what they are told, hugs you and kisses you often and whispers their love for you every night before they fall asleep.   Of course you may discipline the naughty child, but do you still have unconditional love for both children mommies and daddies of the world?   Of course you say?   Well let's see..........  Late one summer night you decide to go to the corner store to buy some milk after the children have fallen asleep, upon returning only ten minutes later you are horrified to see that your house is engulfed in flames. Knowing both children are inside, and could be burning alive at this very moment, you know you need to make a quick judgement. Which child will you save??????  What ??    Both you say?   Why would you save both children?????  What?? Because you love both of them??? Why?  One child is a complete terror, and doesn't even love you!!! Why would you do such a thing???  The Christian God wouldn't!!  What you say??? God has unconditional love, even more than a mere human mother?  Really????  Well, let's take a look at the GOD of love for just a moment...  God has many children in this world yet he punishes those who do not love or "believe" in him, with fire for ALL ETERNITY does that sound like unconditional love to you???  If I, as a mere human mother, can love my children with the unconditional love that GOD cannot, does he truly love and forgive better than us "silly" humans that he supposedly created?   Or are we all just ignorant children, hoping that our "father's" approval (with strict unrealistic conditions), equals love?  You decide... Can you do something better than God?  What you say, if he didn't love us he wouldn't have sent Jesus to "save" us and forgive our sins? We'll believing in Jesus is still a condition isn't it? Something to think about.  Ps.    The sins of god include: murder (of the whole world except the ark), impregnating a virgin, rewarding lot after he tried to give away his virgin daughters to the town, acceptance of polygamous marriages in the old testament, etc. etc. etc. If a human were on trial for the same things we would put them away forever. Yet we excuse God by saying he knows what's best for us and he can do whatever he wants because he is GOD. Our American laws are based on the ten commandments yet we follow the laws of GOD who cannot keep his own commandments. If God was truly a perfect being he would have known in his "all time seeing vision" that we would mess up, and he wouldn't have tested eve with the apple. If God never made mistakes why did he wipe out the entire planet with a flood after the first batch of people did work out? If God didn't make mistakes why bother with the ten commandments if he knew nobody could follow them and he would have to send Jesus to get crucified on a cross to make up for it? I thought God knew everything. Frankly I've seen better administrative work during the Clinton administration, and that's saying something.  When will the (educated) wealthy countries learn to spread hope through actual tangible help to third world nations instead of "helping" them with false promises of heaven while we steal their oil, diamonds, and hope?  We have battered those weaker than us with our "religion" for far too long Somebody stop the planet, this "saved" Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist turned Evangelical Atheist wants to get off.

 Patrick Smith knows a lot about Japan, having lived there for several years and being a journalist specializing in the country. He knows more than I do, to say the least. It is therefore surprising that he should produce a report so reactionary and misleading, and attempt to support so many disparate theses with such poor or virtually non-existent arguments. (And even more surprising to me that it won an award) 
 This disc is like a Whitman's candy sampler:  It has a lot of different things... but a lot of the things you don't really want.  The film covers kids, high schoolers, college ball and college recruiting/pay controversies, ABA, NBA through all its decades, Harlem Globetrotters, the street game and inner-city stars, country boys, Indiana basketball, retired old timers hanging in Florida, current stars, marketing (are there ANY hoop videos that don't talk about sneaker brands), public relations, fireworks, cheerleaders, guys on trampolines, women's basketball..... Whew.  None of these subjects is studied in depth.  If you've followed basketball for a while, you know and have seen most of this.  The subject sampling seems to jump all over the place, so it would be hard to hit chapters to see just what you want.  I'd rather see a DVD star profile (Jordon, Iverson) or "NBA at 50" or Spike Lee's movie, or "Hoop Dreams," etc.  1 Love is such a sampler it feels like the disc should come free with the purchase of a Wilson basketball.  Or it seems like something you'd see on Sunday TV, after most people have turned off their sets when the real game ends.  In short, "1 Love" is a decent sampling, but nothing to sink your teeth into 
 I bought this book due to an over-active click finger (ever experienced that?).  I regret the finger-enthusiasm (though the price was not high).  I did not get my small amount of money's worth.    Basically you have someone who pulls too many punches, skimpy partial unbalanced survey of prior creativity studies, skimpy partial unbalanced survey of fMRI and MRI and prior imaging studies of brains while people do creativity-related things, skimpy partial unbalanced survey of the mental-illness-creativity link literature (not citing five of the top ten sources in this literature!), skimpy partial unbalanced survey of the non-literature non-music non-art types of creativity (invention, scientific discovery, engineering design, fashion design, anything design, etc.)--in sum, this book is an excellent introduction to 1/1000th of its topic.   999 more books and you would have a good idea of what creativity is and does.   I am puzzled by all the big name endorsements of this book--is there some sort of investment or personal relationship or mystical community thing that explains why they would endorse so clearly a partial work--are they old and getting dotty--are they simply constantly, week in and week out, endorsing everything that comes across their desk?    It makes me get careful about buying--if Gardner and his sort endorse something in the future, I will be skeptical about buying it after my experience with this tome.  Also suspicious is the lack of computer  access to the table of contents--a glance at that before ordering and I would have never ordered, it is trite, out of date, and clearly a hackneyed repetition and re-covering of past territory, territory that was new and exciting in idea terms, say, 30 years ago.   Anyone who thinks this book will introduce them to creativity and recent creativity research in its full splendor is in for a rude shock or a very bad future education.  It is not that this book does not cover the entire current literature on creativity--it is this book reeks of never having read EVEN the TITLES of those articles, books, conferences, and algorithms.  I can forgive not having read the sources but I cannot forgive never having read their titles and thereby knowing how very partial one's own efforts really are.    One star is too much.  
 A friend of me, who lives in Europe, lent this book to me, some months ago.I'm an agronomist and I live in Brazil.As an agronomist, I found this book so bad, that I didn't read all of it. On chapter 5, this book claims that "Green Revolution" wasn't an answer.In fact the "Green Revolution" gave food fo billions of people in the world.Today, because of modern agronomy there's more per capita food than any other time in world history. On chapter 7, this book is against free market, as a good solution.Well even recognizing the failures of free market, I should tell you that any other possiblity is far worse.We must remember that Lenin, Stalin,Hitler and Mao Tse-Tung killed more than 100,000,000 people, by hungry.And any of these marxist was using "free market" to produce all this famine. In fact,modern agronomy ( mecanization, fertilizers, bigger farms, transgenic seeds,etc.) gave to the mankind better and cheaper food. Another fact is that old agriculture produces food at a very high price and low quality also.If we return to agriculture from about 100 years ago, the majority of world population will be sentenced to death by famine.  Claiming absurds about agriculture, this book can be used as a fertilizer 
 Where should I start...Anthony Quinn was incoherent and difficult to understand...someone put him out of his misery and have him retire already....Stalone...well the name speaks for itself...Madeline ... why oh why did you get mixed up in this project??? Has your career come to an end??  Sylvester is obviously, finally off the steriods, because in this movie, he was so thin and drawn.  He hardly had any muscle mass.  It did not look like him...is he wearing a wig in this movie?  One time box-office attractions got together and made this movie. WHY WHY WHY??? I want my money back, I want my 90 minutes of my life back.  G A R B A G E and jokes were very corny.  Stallone looked like he was sleeping half the time 
 Book is decently written and information logically presented. However, it does not really provide adequate details for application of techniques.  It indicates that basic obedience is the fundamental method of correcting dogs who show aggression, but does not give adequate in-depth specifics to support the title's promise 
 I found this book was written like a comedy but because it only made me laugh once it was just silly. Comedy is one of those itchy things that you either get it, and love it or you don't. I didn't. I found the dialect frustrating: It was supposed to be set in Kent but the dialect read more like northern England, you have to read it slower to work out what is being said and in doing so you lose your attention slightly which takes the edge off the humour to the extent that you're not even aware that humour is present. At least that's what it was like for me. Whatever the nasty thing in the cowshed was isn't explained in the end but you're left feeling that there is a hint of bestiality that didn't really suit the book, being or trying to be a comedy, hence the lack of explanation. I've given it two stars because when Gibbons takes a step back and looks at the overall picture she has a great way of describing scenes 
 This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book. 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war.  With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance.  Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism.  He should be writing political speeches, not history.  His theories are just plain silly.    If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting 
 This book was a big disappointment. Unfortunately, Mr. Leddick is neither  a scholar nor a very good story teller.  His work is poorly documented, and  provides little social context for the subjects' milieu.  I was also  disappointed in the book's failure to convey any historical context as the  bits and pieces of the subjects' lives were scantilly discussed.  Although  he succeeds in giving the reader a rough synopsis of the lives of Lynes,  Cadmus and Kirstein (at least covering the period of time that Lynes was  alive), he conveys little understanding of the artistic contributions of  each or how these men or their artistic contributions were interconnected.   The book makes it seem that the three were only "intimate  companions" through a loosely defined group of cocktail party  habitués, hardly a basis for a meaningful "triography".  One  wonders why Leddick chose these three as worthy of a joint writing.  It  appears that a biography of each would have included little material about  the others.  I would have thought a "triography" of George Platt  Lynes, Monroe Wheeler and Glenway Westcott, who lived in a ménage à trois  of sorts, would have made far more interesting reading, as would a  "triography" of Paul Cadmus, and Jared and Margaret French.   Instead, the reader comes away from "Intimate Companions" starved  to read a well-documented exposé of each of these men's lives and artistic  contributions 
 i never even got this book because apparently its not a book yet amazons web site said it was. it took me 4 phone calls with 4 different customer service reps for some one to figure that out. all they gave me for the inconvenance was a 15 dollar amazon gift card which i tryed to use and doesn't work. i still don't have the book i needed and it is 4 weeks into the semester. i have baought other things from amazon and gotten them but this expeirance makes me never want to use amazon again. i would like to give you a review of the actual book but i never recieved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Usually I like fantasy, comic fantasy, parodies of all sorts etc... but I simply was not able to move beyond first ten pages -and believe me, I tried! After all those good reviews...  being not able to read even half a book - this almost does not happen to me (usually I feel obliged to author to read more, before passing judgement). BORING 
 Acting plot and everything is so bad that it made me cry... Dragonheart was breathtaking this is......B.S.. worst acting and story i ever saw in a movi 
 This is the worst thing.  Never buy this one!!! There is serious noise,big problem.. 
 Terrible and pretentious writing. I tried to read this book without much luck. If you have trouble sleeping, this is the perfect sleeping pill. 
 Gordon Chang's book on China gives an interesting but rather one-sided insight into various aspects of the China economy. The message you are likely to take home from this book is that the author believes that the Chinese people will stage a popular uprising and get rid of the Communists. The other 346 pages appear to have been written to support this belief. Many Chinese state-owned enterprises are indeed not the most exciting credit risk on this planet, however, they are changing and those who cannot adapt will die. Similarly, the banking system leaves further room for improvement. Chang largely omits the changes the banking system in general and the Big Four banks in particular have undertaken in the last ten years, a process which should continue for at least another decade or two. Corruption is a problem, but there is nothing uniquely Chinese about it, and by itself it is not enough of a catalyst for a revolution. That a transition from communism to a free market economy is causing all sorts of discontent especially amongst those who are not able to make that transition shouldn't come as a surprise. However, I doubt very much whether the `gasoline lake' (of discontent) Chang mentions is as large as he would like it to appear.  This book maybe a worthwhile read if you are looking for an up-date on various aspects of China. But you will notice that it is a single-issue book. A more balanced approach to the subject would have added more quality. 
 Dr. Laura puts everything in absolutes.  Too bad life is not as black and white as she makes appear.  I didn't find her book helpful to my situation.  A book I highly recommend for parents/couples is "Good Parents Bad Parenting."  The author of this book deals in reality and was very helpful to my husband and myself 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 This book is now 8 years old, and we can see the 'fruit' of this kind of thinking in churches today.  Many churches who have put into action the ideas in this book have turned into 'feel good' Christian social clubs.  Don't talk about conviction of sin, the need for repentance and obedience to our Lord.  Instead talk about mistakes and how we are basically all good people.  So many churches, sadly, have become post-modern by clinging to the ways of the world, and THIS is destroying the church.   I hope the authors of this book have the courage to now deal with the 'fruits' of their recommendations.  Maybe a good follow-up to this book would be to deal with how the ideas put forth are now 'killing' the church, and how teaching the truth of Christ, the easy and the not so easy parts, are what people truly need in this dying world 
 Following the advice of the others on this page I duly purchased this book. I can now safely say it will be my LAST time following the general concensus! What is WITH you people?  A photographer/grafik designer by trade, specialising in print-based media I have never done web-based work (other than actually designing pages and buttons in Illustrator - and then having someone else doing the converting, assembly etc.)  so I decided to buy a book and have a go. To get straight to the point this book is a piece of crap for the following reasons. 1) (despite professing otherwise) It is totally incoherent, and follows a very illogical progression pattern. 2) The grafiks are so sadly outdated and amateur-ish I cringed every time I opened the book. 3) It fails to empower the reader to move freely and thus visualise their own ideas. 4) It is VERY incomprehensive. 5) It is very hard to navigate, has no real index, no thumb tags etc. It is like a 'Big Mac' - it looks yummy and filling and when you take a bite it SEEMS to fill you up, but soon you are hungry for more REAL FOOD. My advice? Go for a less disturbingly 'visual' format that provides you with the building blocks to build your own house 
 This book is offensive to at least one of the two genders, though it's hard to say which. It suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot, more or less. Whether that's more insulting to the male brain or the female body, I'm not sure, but the book portrays neither gender realistically.  I like Heinlein, and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential, but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass, and it's not even particularly good at being that.  The gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so, but Heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature. More's the pity 
 No suction and only ran about 2 minutes after an all night charge. I returned it as defective, which it was. A waste of money. I recommend the excellent Dirt Devil 083414 Extreme Power Stick Vacuum, also sold by Amazon 
 I usually enjoy her books but this one was truly disappointing. Such a silly plot. I finished it but kept saying to myself..."Why not just toss this one?" 
 I'm not going to proceed to judge this movie on the unhistoricity of the claims it makes about Christianity.  By now, thanks to this film and the book of the same title, most individuals interested in Christology should be aware that this story is nothing more than ignis fatuus.  That being said, I will make this critique based on the quality and presentability of the film, and not on the controversies it has stirred within certain caucuses.  As a movie the Code leaves much to be desired.  There are gaps in the story line and overlooked pieces of evidence in The Louvre museum by the police that no respectable law enforcement agency would fail to detect.  For example, Langdon and detective Neveu, after successfully evading Captain Feche in the museum, strike a series of clues (writings, bloodstains, keys) that the entire investigatory team analyzing the crime scene failed to uncover. Langdon and Detective Neveu fail to ask each other seemingly obvious questions that- if answered- might end the movie immediately or take it in a whole new direction.  Ian McKellen, a fabulous actor of extraordinary talent, lacks complete credibility in this film.   So what went catastrophically wrong?  Well, it wasn't the book or its author Dan Brown, who has been selling copies of the Code faster then they can count them.  And although the performances were at best questionable, by themselves these are not enough to sink the movie.  The most obvious answer as to why the Code is so deficient is Ron Howard, the director.  Mr. Howard simply lacked the vision and forethought to successfully and credibly present The Da Vinci Code in a manner believable (as a film, not history) to the audience. I think most individuals who gave this film favorable ratings were captured by the mystery and romantic luster most conspiracies are imbued with, and had a pre-formulated supposition of Jesus and his relationship to Mary Magdalene 
 As a new subscriber to the organic food movement but needing more information on it, I bought this book because I thought it would by my primary "source" on it.  Wrong.  I expected page after page of sound and detailed arguments where the author would SHOW the reader the benefits of organic food.  Instead what I got was 4 page chapters where the author only tells the reader why it's better, and does so with minimal evidence.  It goes into way too much detail on the legal and commercial history of the movement leaving out a thorough analysis and comparison of the real value of organic food, that it's not processed like conventional food is.  Showing this process through illustrative righting and contrasting with organic food, perhaps doing a commidity chain analysis on several food items, needs to be the centerpiece of such a book and it is simply missing.  For those more interested in the evolution of organic food and looking for contemporary resources on it, this is their book 
 I bought this one to cancel the server's noise in my cube. Turns out to be waste of money. Not any better than the regular headphone I already have. Also not quite comfortable. 
 I bought this in order to estimate the vaule of my collection for insurance puposes and wasted my money. The guide claims that, for example, my mono Jackie McLean "Destination Out" is worth $30. If I were to lose my copy due to fire or some other reason would I be able to find another copy for $30? Absolutely not. More like $60. Several listings are completely out of touch with the current market and subsequent repressings of older recordings are overpriced. If you really had no idea about the jazz LP market then this book will be of at least some help. You might be cheating yourself, however, if you are looking to appraise a jazz collection about which are are unfamiliar 
 Now, I realize after taking a closer listen to this album that this album is not a gospel rap album. On ''Know thy self'', Krs claims that there are many ways to god which is downright not true. Krs claims that any ''God'' that's worshipped will lead you to heaven. Think about that, Allah, Buddah, Jesus, Aphrodite all have nothing to do with each other! Only Jesus deserves to be worshipped! Jesus is the son of god, He did die, And he's the only one that rose again so we could all have a chance to enter heaven regardless of our sin [Which every man and woman has]. As for the cd, I won't lie, It sounds really good and even features a few gospel rappers [T-Bone, B.B. Jay], and Krs even makes significant quotes of actual bible verses, But when it comes down to it, Krs still fails to acknowledge that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This cd gets 2 stars from me for the fact that at least Krs is done dissing Jesus [Something he did on every album after ''Criminal Minded'' and every album before ''The Sneak Attack''] and at least he still ain't afraid to expose the problems of this world, But Krs, If you're reading this, I think you're an extremely talented rapper and you truly need to accept Jesus into your heart. Hope the review helped. Be blessed. 
 All the reviews of this book that I read included the words "Well written". This book has a good language, and includes good information on several parts of the world. But it still lacks something. I believe that Hamish McRae has not put enough stress on some very important economic regions, such as South East Asia (the Indian SubContinent), Eastern Europe and Eastern Africa. The only reason why that could be is because of incomple research. This lets the readers draw wrong conclusions about these parts. I would not recommend this book to a friend or use it for any sort of research 
 I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like "what just happened!". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.  Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.  There seem to be no faults in the utopian "good guys" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.   Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.  The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional "Clans". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.  But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:  What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story.   That is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer.  I love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented. No offense to anyone that loves it 
 This is by far the worst book i"ve ever read, and as they say those who don't do.. teach... and those who can't teach... teach gym.  He should try teaching or something else but NOT WRITING! for god's sake spare us the  littany 
 A book on a truly fascinating topic, plagued by sloppy copy editing and proof reading, and enough errors to make it annoying to any reader who knows how to use grammer, grommar, or whatever they call that. How disappointing 
 I dont like it when hippies start writing books bout things! and I dont like Hippies and also I dont like books, unless im throwing books at hippies. 
 At some point, nearing the end of the novel, someone arrives in the Land of Dead where souls suffer by deteriorating at infinitely slow rates and not having the ability to cease to exist completely.  This is a pretty decent metaphor for how I felt approaching the last 100 pages of this book.    I am someone who absolutely loved both "Name of the Rose" and "Foucault's Pendulum" and I, naturally, expected more of the same.  If you're like me, you will not find it here.  Maybe about 20% of the book is genuinely enjoyable, and it offers some juicy tid-bits thrown in that are only appreciable by people intimately familiar with "The Three Musketeers," which, fortunately, I am.  As for the rest, I often caught myself asking "Why am I still reading this?"  For all my earnest suffering and faith, there was no payoff in the end 
 I purchased "ABC's of Newborn Baby Care" and another video called "Bringing Baby Home". The "ABC's" video uses a baby who is not a newborn. The umbilical cord is healed and the baby is at least three weeks old. The video does go over basic care of how to hold, change, dress a baby, bottle cleaning and baths, but skips over the details I would have found useful. "Bringing Baby Home" by the Liandrea Company is a much more complete video that uses actual newborns and parents (no actors)and covers a wider range of information. I do not recomment ABC's of Newborn Baby Care as anything but a suppliment to another video 
  Mr. Bonewits is not a true pagen...just check out his homepage...He`ll sell anything to make a buck! He knows NOTHING about True druidism,wicca, or "real magick" 
 This book was recommended to me by an actual SPY!  I found it boring. The characterization of Russians, Israelis, and Arabs were very heavy handed and charicaturish. more precisely, the character of the Hezzbolah Sheik was totally unbelieivable, he seemed to say things that would be impossible to imagine someone in his position saying.. really bad boring stupid book which i threw away a quarter of the way in!  This is absolutley not like early lecarre with his subtle characters and nuanced plots.  Thumbs down 
 I have returned the shirt from amazon/macys. I did not like it and I am still waiting for my refund. I purchased it in January. Where's my refund. I will not buy from companies that don't offer free shipping. I was charged to recieve it and also to ship it back.                               Ms. Michelle Watso 
 This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion.  If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it 
 There is no thrill in this book.  It is one of the worst books I have ever  read.  The only thing worse than this book is getting your arm cut off.  I  am extremely dissapointed at this author and publishing company for putting  out a book this crapy 
 I ordered the original item, used it for about a week, then sent it to my son in New Hampshire.  He used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up, never to function properly again.  I ordered a replacement, checked it out and sent it on to him, with the same result -- less than 15 minutes of use, it quit working. I thought the unit was nice, compact and fairly easy to use, but with two malfunctions in two cameras, I don't think I would recommend this Aiptek model to anyone 
 This is Zodiac Speaking: The author Robert Graysmith has it all wrong. I am not Arthur Leigh Allen.   If you like true crime novels, pass on this one as it does'nt cut the mustard. The author has made up his mind that a man named Arthur Leigh Allen is the infamous Zodiac. What you will not find in "Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Exclusive Serial Killer" are the true facts that clear Allen as the killer. Fingerprints do not match, DNA does not match, handwriting does not match. Thumbs down on this poorly concieved book 
 I love Eric Carle's books, but this one does not measure up to his other works. It introduces an animal eating a food on each day of the week starting with Monday (not Sunday), but there is no plot and is just plain boring. Wish I hadn't spent my money on this one 
 This book has a fairly annoying layout which refers back to information not previously mentioned.  The examples are also fairly overly complex, there are much simpler ways to solving the problems.  Regardless, it was a required book 
 When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use 
 It does let you shake and mix up the protein well. But no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads. Then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere. It's a horribly cheap and leaky design. I would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it. (and if you find a good one that doesn't leak please post the info here and let me know). Thanks 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 I just paid $1.00 for this book, and overpaid.  The book seems limited to what the author likes to do, not what you may choose to do.   For instance: 1. Kitchner for Stockinette is fully explained, but far from the best I've seen.  For Garter, only the warning that ii is more complicated, and one illustration, but no written instructions.  For Ribbing, just the warning that it's too hard for her. 2. There is no mention of steeks, not even in the glossary.  Even if the book doesn't cover the subject, it should be included in any list of knitting terms. 3.  The original owner of the book had written a question about measuring guage swatches on or off the needles.  After reading the author's section on guage, I'm not surprised.  Her swatching method leaves much to be desired, and in spite of several warnings about measuring not only the swatch but the work in progress several times to be sure the guage stays even throughout the garment, it was not explained that the swatch should be blocked as the finished garment will before being measured. Remember that size 6 sweater that became a 15 when washed and blocked?  If only you'd blocked the swatch first.  THese are just three of the shortcomings I spotted in a quick review.  I doubt I'll even explore the book farther, but at least I didn't pay full price.  All in all, a great disappointment, even at $1.00, and perhaps not deserving of even the one star minimum rating 
 The hype got to me and I picked this up. Really underwhelmed. Tracks are aesthetically similar to Sunn O))) but they are much more traditional in approach and sound like fuzzed up pop songs. Which, if they were interesting songs, might be good. There are some flashes of death metal but nothing original or exciting.  Overall, where Earth and Sunn O))) take a traditional form and reinvent it, Boris goes back to the original template and produces something that isn't that compelling.  To be fair, its not bad, it's just not that good 
 I have only walked out of a handful of movies, and this was one of them.  Everything about this movie was contrived and stilted. While Blake Edwards has produced some classic movies, this simply is not one of them.  I recommend S.O.B if you're looking for a truly excellent Edwards fil 
 They were on sale, and I ordered 2. They arrived separately in two HUGE boxes - via UPS - and looked like they had both been dropped from about 10 stories up. Sigh... The mats themselves had broken and cracked rubber backing. I guess they got beaten up in transit. The actual pattern in the mats is beautiful and the fiber is nice and dense. So - I kept them. They are outside and hopefully they won't fall apart too quickly.  If you are really picky, you better take a good look at these when they are delivered 
 I was disappointed with this book because I expected more substance on how to cure cat behavioral problems.  Most of what was presented in the book was common sense.  The book also doesn't offer any in-depth case histories and therapy plans for cats with particular problems.  I feel this book would be useful for someone who knows little about cats.  However, if you are familar with cats and their basic needs, this book doesn't offer much more insight than most people would know.  I expected more from a well-known behaviorist.  If you are really looking for an in-depth book on pet behavior that is more useful, read Pam Johnson-Bennett's "Psycho Kitty" book.  I found it to be absolutely excellent. 
 Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up. I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).  Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest. So naturally i thought this would be the same. The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work. I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book. This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore 
 This system will not work.  Let's assume your playing in a 6-deck game. This system has you start your running count at -20, with -4 or higher as the "key" (The point at which you bet high). Using the KO method, after all of the decks are counted through the count will be +4. Does anyone else see the flaw here? Let's say you have a count of -3. This system tells you to bet high (Even suggesting 10 betting units!). But think about it, if a deck completely counted through will end up at +4, then there's a better chance that you'll be drawing low cards, meaning the dealer actually has the advantage. Put simply, if you use this system YOU WILL BE BETTING HIGH WHEN THE DEALER HAS THE ADVANTAGE. If I'm wrong then correct me, please. But I believe this is a very faulty system. If you win anything using it, count it off as luck. Eventually it will ruin you.  This book explains other counting systems as being near impossible for the average person to learn; even explaining how difficult the Hi-Lo system is (Bull). The Hi-Lo system is still the easiest effective counting system (Explained well in Wong's "Professional Blackjack") with the Omega II being one of the most powerful (Beautifully explained in "Blackjack for Blood" by Bryce Carlson). I highly recommend either one of those two systems.  There is a note in this book about the notion of blackjack books being put out by casinos to sort of sabotage counters with false tips. I believe this may very possibly be one of those books. Avoid, avoid, avoid 
 Wrong version, was searching for an older version where the little mermaid dies.  This is not that version!!!!  Shame on Amazo 
 It is an excellent book on how to make polymer clay jewelry, figures, etc.  I have watched Donna Kato on TV and she is an excellent polymer clay artist.  She should have her own TV show.  I congratulate her for doing such a good, meticulous job on polymer clay.  Thank you, Glori 
 This stuff is very expensive and I've diligently used it as the directions state. I havent seen growth. I am actually losing more eyelashes!! I was going to buy the mascara if I grew the eyelashes but it doesn't seem to be working. *sigh 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Have this unit in out house, we have the one with one base unit and two mobile units.  A few things to note. The ones we had do not offer rechargeable batteries. It uses alkaline only, or if you have your own charger you could use rechargeable but would be nicer if it recharged while plugged in.  We live in NYC, Queens to be exact. We hear taxi cab radio chatter over this at times, especially at night. Also if unit is close to base unit static is not too bad but still annoying in bedroom, BUT if you have it one floor away, forget it. Unless child is screaming all you hear is static. on both units.  Only has two channels A & B which are set manually at both base and hand held units. So if you have a bad signal in middle of night, you have to go into child's room and change channel. Just don't wake the baby! Ouch!  Also missing a pager and a "walkie talkie" feature. They would be very nice. Not a deal breaker if they don't have it BUT it can be handy especially if your two floors up with baby with a full diaper and Spouse is in basement and you need more diapers from Garage.  I am about to have a second child, and I am replacing this unit with a better one, I am looking at one of the new digital units that have the noise/static reduction. Consumer Reports gave some of them their top marks. They are however way more pricey than these, some are near $200 and only one receiver. But they all have charging bases and most importantly they are static free with AUTO channel switching 
 What was an exciting adventure novel back in the 1970's for a young pre-teen (was I ever so young?) on re-reading now turns out to be a silly James Bond knock-off/Summer beach book. The most grating conceit is the author's habit of giving every *single* female charactor a "clever" name (Anna Bidet - French, Randi Knickers-English, Jemima Brown-African American, etc...). It hasn't aged well 
 Johnson lumps in "the gay lifestyle" with "alcoholism, drug addiction, sexual perversion, and any number of terrible problems that can afflict a family" (Pg 172). If you find this appalling, then avoid the book because there's a lot more of this.  If that doesn't bother you, then you might find some inspiration here. Clearly many have. If you prefer anecdotes/stories to bullet point advice on how to pick yourself up, this is the book for you.  But to be on the safe side, if you're looking for a role model in dealing with homosexuality in your family, do look beyond this author. While many believe that homosexuality can be "cured" with prayer, it is more widely held (by the medical community amongst others) that this is not a condition that can be cured any more than blue eyes or black hair. Be sure your approach doesn't do lasting damage to your child and your family.  
 The illustrations are very poor and the text is basic to say the least. Book looks like it was put together in a "home-press". Not the book for a serious biology student or ichthyologist 
 I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 I bought this item at the end of January and received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to order another color and see if it does the same.  Not very happy with this 
 Not sure about these other reviews but all I can say is make sure to buy yourself a package of Tylenol's with this book, because after reading a few pages your head will be ready to explode.  I am trying to read this book with other 25 people and not one person has said that this book is good.  Make sure that you have alot of spare time if you are going to read this crap, because you will be taking more naps while trying to get through this book, then all the naps you have taken throughout your whole lifetime.  Geoff Huston would make a great lawyer but not a book writer 
 this was advertised as a new book when in fact it is used. 
 Forgive me for disagreeing with this book's many content-free, clearly-cropped back cover quotes, but this is not a serious effort by any intelligent measurement. Hassan's prose is plodding and devoid of any nuance or invention. It's no wonder this one was self-published. Where's the insight? DO NOT waste your time on this one. Relevant subject matter has been trampled on with half-coherent, pseudo-expertise. I want my money back 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 The differences between females and males was truly the best part of the book. After that I had several disappointments. As a single Mother I am looking for suggestions and guidance. This author states that no matter what we do as parents are children's lifestyles and habits are based on how their brains are formed!! How discouraging. There were also other references that go against my own personal and spirtual beliefs. My suggestion to other potential readers is to read this book from a different perspective. Do not read it as a guide as I did. Read it as another viewpoint out there about the incredible world of boys 
 I had high hopes for this novel as a fun summer distraction. The advertised story line seemed to promise a "Flim-flam Man" type plot with some spooky doings thrown in for fun. In fact the story quickly turns into a substandard mystery whodunit. Most disappointing is the author's failure to really develop what could been a very rich assortment of primary and secondary characters. Half way through I realized I just didn't care what happened. The older I get the less willing I am waste time on bad books- there's just too many good ones waiting to be read. 
 I was really excited about this book before I opened it.  I was very disappointed to see that it really only covers larger houses which already have space available.  All the pictures show rooms with high to very high ceilings, entrance ways, and alot of open space.  Unfortunately, I think, that the average house is much smaller, with less room to work with & lower ceilings, not every place has utility rooms, verandas or entrance ways to utilize.  Even the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen.  Also, many houses do not even have very much extra wall space due to small room dimensions, windows, doorways & possibly a fireplace.  Try to work around that - that's what I was expecting to see, I guess, more variety in the types of homes.  If you do get this book, be prepared to renovate 
 Twenty-something Bette lives in Manhattan, has a close knit group of friends, enjoys romance novels, and apparently possesses little fashion sense or celebrity IQ. Everyone Worth Knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations, and finds romance--real and fictional--along the way.   Maybe it's just me, but Bette seems to have problems many people would love to "suffer" through. Although told a lot of things about her, I never got the feeling I could really picture Bette or understand what she wanted, even in the end. Her story feels underdeveloped and many of the events predictable or random. Still, if you liked The Devil Wears Prada and enjoy modern formulaic romances, you will probably enjoy Everyone Worth Knowing 
 Great concept, I found the book to be pretty uninspired and choppy.  The author definitely was influenced by ESPNs Sports Guy Bill Simmons, reads like a less skilled Simmons rant.  I wish I could agree with the other reviews 
 I found the performance of these Michelin tires to be adequate.  There doesn't seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well.  The road seems to have eaten these tires up...I have less than 1,000 miles on it and the tires are full of holes--that may say something about the quality of roads out here in Hawaii.  I'm getting a flat every time I ride.  My next tire will be something a little sturdier 
 I ran out and purchased this book on name recognition alone - after all this IS Dr. Spock!  After the first gentle chapter, reassuring all new parents that we know more than we think we do and we should trust our instincts, this book takes some very strange turns.  The first is Dr. Spock's views on vegetarian diet for babies.  We are most definetly NOT vegetarians, but this book made me feel almost guilty about not raising my baby in a more "healthy" fashion.  What's more, he offers almost no nutrition and diet information for us omnivores (as if you don't follow his advice and become a vegetarian, you aren't worth addressing).  The second weird part was his advice on sleep issues - particulary dealing with an infant who cries to the point of vomiting in her crib.  His solution (page 526)?  Ignore it and let her cry herself to sleep - you can clean up the vomit later!  The third - and most bizzare - offering is on children in the parents bed:  he advises against it, which is fine, and then goes on to say that it is acceptable for the child to come to the parents bed in the morning to spend a few quality snuggling moments before the family starts their day as long as - get this (page 522) - "IT DOESN'T MAKE EITHER PARENT UNEASY, FOR EXAMPLE, BY STIRRING UP SEXUAL FEELINGS"!  I'm not sure who his target audience is, but my husband and I are definetly not part of that group.  My advice is to skip this book and purchase "The New First Three Years of Life"  by Dr. Burton White (for developmental issues) and Caring for your Baby and Young Child" by the American Academy of Pediatrics (for child health issues 
 Now where's the old John Stossel who stood up for consumers against sleazy scams perpatrated by corrupt businesses? Guess he thought it's better to steal all the taxpayer money than to fight for taxpayer justice. For all his ramblings in this book, he might as well blabber on the Emmy Awards and get lost ! Let's see how this clown fares when the public lion wakes up and tears his ligaments to shreds  
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 I was very disappointed that the version of "Paper Roses" included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990.  It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians.  So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated "Paper Roses.&quot 
 Shame on Routledge for touting as a centenary edition this dog, riddled with egregious typos ("simiotics"? "ernestly"?), whose footnotes refer one to pages on which that which is alleged to have taken place does not, in fact, take place. I like the intros, and the very spacey Micky James foreword. But Routledge does not deserve the $18.95 I gave them for this book, which is, apparently, in the public domain, and which I can read, without typos, online. Shame!!!! 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 or in their entire career for that matter.  I have tried to like this band, but Greg Dulli just won't shut up.  Every song is his snide lyrical diatribing, on and on and on.  The guitarist keeps things mildly interesting, but on this album in particular, the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight beat for once.  It's like three guys in their own worlds, and they mash it together and call what they've done songs.  EXCEPT for the one decent song they did, the only rock song I can think of that is hard, psychedelic, passionate, powerful, and set to a waltz beat of all things.  "LEt me lie to you" is the best song they ever made, BECAUSE everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song's framework and tempo.  Instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do, everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses, and it's less muddled and better orchestrated for it.  IT's a shame they didn't do any other songs like this, at least none that I have heard.  I tried to like them, I really did.  I wanted to find the band that made that one song, and discover a whole treasure chest of dark, passionate, noisy music like that.  Too bad, no wonder they drifted apart 
 The chocolate war  The chocolate war was one of the best books I have ever read...NOT! The chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene. The boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot. I would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate. I don't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level. This story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out. I think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie. Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. I wish this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a horrid book. Therefore, this book would be great if the author published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate situations and words 
 I really liked the song "Somewhere in the Night" ever since I saw the episode where it was featured. The way it was played with Scott solo at the piano was haunting & powerful--just a great song. When I saw that there was a CD of it, I considered getting it and finally did. Unfortunately I didn't do my homework and was very disappointed to find that the CD version takes a sweet piano performance and turns it into a less touching and more forgettable "easy listening rock" song that doesn't do his on-screen performance of the song justice. And apparently the only place to get the piano-only version is on the episode :(   The rest of the CD is a mixed bag. Scott Bakula is definitely multi-talented, and it is enjoyable and fun to hear him play some of the different songs from the show--but nothing fantastic. The only standout vocal song on the disc would have been "Somewhere"--and that was ruined for me by the "easy listening" chorus. The instrumental tracks are okay--I'm admittedly not a big fan of instrumental music, so take my review with that grain of salt included.  As opposed to many reviewers, I quite enjoyed the interview clip. It was fun to hear some of Scott's background and what he enjoyed about working on the show. And how great is it to hear straight from the star's mouth that he would love to take the role up again in the future? As a fan, that's really nice to hear.   So my take is--if you're a QL fan, and you can get it used for a decent price, it's fun for a listen. Non-fans should probably look elsewhere.  
 I did a little calculating and I figure that if they sell all 20,000 (LIMITED EDITION??) of these for $40,000 each, they make $800 million.  But, the free shipping is killing them. IF they only charged $10,000 shipping, they could make a billion dollars on this book 
 Wendell Berry is one of my favorite poets; I highly recommend 'Entries', 'The Timbered Choir, and his various collected and selected poems to anyone interested in language that is alive and powerful in evocatively imagistic and spiritual ways. But 'Given' left me a bit cold. These poems would be better suited to Berry's excellent agrarian commentary work; but as poetry they failed the genre a bit, coming off like bland polemics in a language all too flat. The work is not without some merit, but I would certainly give Berry's other collections a much higher priority 
 I expected so much more from this movie, I guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors (Jolie & Washington) and also had the always on point Queen Latifah as well.  I watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie, but I walked away bitter with shattered expectations.  First off I will say that Latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason I smiled on occasion during this movie experience.  Washington and Jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable (especially Washington who really strained in this role) that I was constantly asking myself "do I really like these two?" and I had to remind myself of movies like 'Gia' and 'Training Day' to answer with a resounding "YES!"  The film follows a rookie cop (Jolie) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop Lincoln (Washington) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called 'The Bone Collector'.  The ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer, while not who you'd pinpoint, is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever.  It's like "oh so he/she did it...interesting"...and I'm bored.  I'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling 
 If I could I would give this book no stars. I did not find anything in this book at all helpful. I bought this when I first got married in hopes that would give me some sort of insight into marriage and my husband. Now 4 years down the line, I learned this book is nothing but rubbish. Foremost I did not care for the author Kevin Leman. He seems like just your typical egotistical male writing a book with the thoughts that all women are fragile little butterflies in a cocoon and all men are barbaric sex maniacs. I am not in anyway a feminist, but unfortunately in alot of marriages the stereotypical "You Jane, Me Tarzan" does not fit. In my case, this was so, which is why this book was of little use to me. I will give it a little credit. In a way, it made me realise how lucky I was that my husband came no where near the way this guy was describing men! Maybe it is a good book for those in "typical" relationships. But, not a good book if you or your significant other falls out of the lines of the "typical" male and female behavior 
 As a work of fiction this is a fine book. Mailer is a great writer and as I don't think this was one of his finest works, it was still an enjoyable read. What I was a bit irked by was the lack of focus on what I thought was going to be the central plot of the novel - Adolf Hitler's childhood. This was a book about his father Alois mostly. It detailed Alois' childhood, relationships, work, children, retirement and death. As soon as he died there was 20 pages left in the book. Yes, you can say that we can gain some sort of insight into Adolf's life indirectly by seeing what a person his father was but this is not very complete. My expectation was that you would see sections of his father throughout his life, sections of his school friends, deep traumatic experiences and what inevitably started him down the road of politics. The ending of this book left me feeling very incomplete, almost as if there was a second volume somewhere that I forgot to purchase 
 Though most of Ballard's work contains unvarying plots, motifs, characters, etc., I was quite stunned to find that `Super Cannes' and `Cocaine Nights' are - albeit with minor tweaks and variations - actually one and the same book.  From the backdrops to the manic idiosyncrasies of the characters, the key components in each enjoy such thorough correspondences and identity that a synopsis of one book effectively adumbrates the other.  It seems Ballard's technique of thematic reiteration and repetition has achieved such perfection as to suggest that an author has finally (and remarkably) cloned his own work and slipped it over the transom.  Read both books if you wish to scrutinize the sublime homogeneity of Ballard's imagination. Or pick one or the other, and feel satisfied that you've economized on money and time 
 This was a well written book, and one I might have enjoyed......if I knew I was reading a secular novel.  I thought I was reading christian fiction, and waited thru almost the entire book for the christian message to shine thru.  I realized almost at the end of the book that was not going to happen. I had no reason to expect otherwise, as she has previously written christian fiction and I got it off the christian fiction shelf at the library.  I'm very glad I didn't pay for this book as I wouldn't have received what I thought I was paying for 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 None of the ideas in this book of checklists are bad, and some are quite good . . . but the volume as a whole lacks a key theme or common idea.  I also prefer a more expository writing style; the endless checklist format gets tiresome after awhile - for me, anyway.  I would look elsewhere for an introductory training book 
 ... and i absolutely love the first owen record and all american football.  how does one go from 5 stars to 2?  First, make obscenely personal songs all about yourself and a girl who broke up with you.  i have a tv for this kind of stuff.  then, just make the songs mediocre.  there are two really good songs though, although i would be embarrased to listen to it in front of anyone else (but i guess the same goes with the first owen album).  good songs=ghost of what..., and i'm not going anywhere.  i guess i just liked the atmospheric stuff better than the raw acoustic sound heard here 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 The first page of this novel contains the following phrase: "The events recorded here concerned only a handful of people and, quite probably, are of interest only to those people. Especially since 'story' is almost certainly the wrong word. Whatever makes events into a story is entirely missing from what follows." After reading the first fifth of the book, I'd have to agree. A slackerish Englishman moves to Paris to write a novel and instead falls in with a fellow Brit, falls in love, and bums around the city. It wasn't that interesting and didn't seem to be going anywhere, so I moved on 
 The show got stuck in a rut throughout most of the second season.  Most of the episodes seemed pretty contrived, and the storylines start to get predictable.  The bright spots of course are anything involving Richard Belzer and Ice T - perhaps the biggest problem with this set is their lack of screen time.  
 I have just started a "finish my basement" project. This book was not helpful. I am glad that I purchased other books as I haven't even used this book at all. It is extremely elementary and gets into things like what a finishing nail is. I found the other books to be much more helpful in actually helping me know what to do to start the work 
 I read this book years ago...or, rather, tried to. I'm sure there are better examples of the truism, "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail," but not many.    If you're another 12-step 'bot who peppers your conversation and decals your bumper with slogans like "One Day at a Time," you'll probably really, really like _When Society Becomes an Addict_. I myself found it to be one of the worst self-help books I've ever seen ... and in a genre glutted with self-indulgence, pseudo-science, and hidden agendas, that's saying a lot.    If there is anything we emphatically do *not* need more of in politics, it's therapy. Lift your head out of your 12-step cocoon and look around you: We've got people using various and often spurious diagnoses to shirk responsibility for everything from proper child-rearing to murder. We've been bringing back censorship with a vengeance in the last few decades because of a misguided belief that the world must cater to the delicate psyches of the traumatized, the easily offended, the "oppressed," and, most of all, "da chyldrun." And no politician dares run for any major office without drawing lots of attention to his or her "sensitive side," often with short, sappy, pseudo-heartwarming "personal interest" films.    Schaef may indeed have claimed that men are no longer the problem, but obviously she still claims that we need to feminize American society more. Uh, when little boys are widely and heavily medicated just for acting like little boys, I think we've feminized society quite enough. And I'm a woman with a good many feminist sympathies.    Too bad it had to take September 11th to wake so many people up to the fact that we need more than consensus-seekers, empathizers, and nurturers -- we need leaders, individuals with the courage to make unpopular moral judgments, and warriors and heroes. Of both sexes 
 The Hoover Floormate was great the first two times we used it.  Along with the Old English it did a great job cleaning and picking up the solution.  After using it twice, it had difficulty dispensing solution from the Reservoir.  This was remedied by having to apply downward pressure constantly.  It still got the job done.  Not too long after that it wouldn't vacuum the solution back into the unit.  I got a great clean for the price divided by four uses.  You do the math.  I'll stick to the "cheap" clorox thing we pulled out of the closet after I put the Floor ex-Mate into the trash.  Very disappointe 
 I bought this book because I wanted to find something that would take my work beyond the standard fair of PowerPoint presentations.  I stumbled upon this book title just before its release and thought by the title that this was exactly what I was looking for.  Advanced techniques would give me a book detailing the cutting-edge of PowerPoint.  Boy was I wrong.  A whole chapter on text placement?  Other chapters detail creating an org chart, creating templates, and using the text tool.  Does that sound like advanced techniques to you?  Sorely disappointed in the book.  My quest goes on for a cutting-edge PowerPoint book 
 Although this book has received the best reviews from students, as an educator, I hate this book. Besides the fact that the author cannot write, there is no sense of responsibility, call to action, or suggestions for improvement for others in a gang life situation.   All this author writes about is ganglife, drugs, violence, sex and glorifies all of them, no wonder my students love it 
 I've read a few Brad Meltzer books, trying to find the fascination that some others have found in them.  Nope, I still haven't figured out his allure yet.  In a radio interview, I heard the interviewer gush over Melter's dialogue. He commented that it's the most realistic dialogue that he had ever read.  I have two problems with this.  a) While some of Meltzer's dialogue is indeed catchy and does sound like your two siblings arguing with each other, Meltzer has no depth.  By that I mean, even the cop's witty banter sounds like he is arguing with his younger brother and the grocer's wisecracks, ad infinitum.  It gets old quick.  b) Who wants to listen to their siblings arguing with each other.  I'll give Meltzer credit for being able to create the image, but most or all of his characters ultimately come off as sounding extremely whiney and self-serving.  I could continue with numerous other complaints, but if knowing about Meltzer's amateurish dialogue doesn't turn you off, you're probably going to buy the book anyway and overlook the one-dimensional cardboard characters 
 If Julia Glass had not set the bar so high with Three Junes, I would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2.  There are sentences, paragraphs, even pages of brilliance in this book, but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing, and character development in particular.  She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around.  As another reviewer wrote, the writing process seemed transparant.  Reading the book, you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass (a privileged white woman of a certain age) imagines teenagers, or New Mexicans, or black chauffeurs, or Hispanic nannies, or even gay people to be like.  She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them.  The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures.  Greenie might be the most believable, and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan, I wasn't sucked along with her when she falls in love with "the other Charlie".  He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth (even temporarily) losing your child over.  With Saga, she manages to develop her most sympathetic character, but Saga's life is left floating and unresolved at the end.  Even the brief appearance of Fenno, who I loved in Three Junes, lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky.  All and all, a very disappointing second novel.  You have to wonder, since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character, what good is her editor?  
 To endure life's inevitable roadblocks, we have to strive not for perfection, but contentment, and miraculously all the pain will go away -- for a while.  What he calls "curing" I call "coping with."  There is no cure for the hardships we all encounter along the way -- becoming a hermit is even worse, as you dwell on what's wrong.  Ultimately, all pain goes through a "receiving center" in the brain, and seratonin blocks the perception of pain and keeps it from "centralizing" in the nervous system.  In his diatribute to the ability to be pain-free, he refers a lot to his former book, BRAIN LONGEVITY, on which he collaborated with the same journalist who has written for several medical magazines.  He uses many "deficits" for possible causes of chronic pain, but specifically names seratonin as the worst, depending on one's pain tolerance threshold.  He says that women suffer more from chronic pain due to hormonal changes, that two-thirds of all patients at pain clinics are women with migraines.  Back pain is three times more prevelant in women, according to this doctor, and chronic muscle pain is ten times more common among the female sex.  All pain signals ultimately land in the brain, where they trigger thought, emotions, memories, and a complex array of biochemical events aimed at protecting your body from further harm.  With chronic pain, the alarm continues to shriek uselessly long after the physical danger has passed.   Seratonin is the body's single best pain-fighter, more important even than endorphins.  Seratonin deficit is a major culprit.  He emphasizes that suffering is one reaction to pain, but not the only possible reaction -- that it is possible to experience pain without suffering from it.  He admits that all lives contain some pain but, when you can experience it without suffering, "your chronic, disabling pain, for all practical purposes will be 'cured'."  Pain is the most common reason people go to doctors.  Dr. Scott Fishman, president of the American Academy of Pain Management feels, "We've wandered from the basic philosophy in medicine, where you cure what you can but always treat suffering, to being focused only on curing."  In the section about arthritis, he confirms that the side effects pain medications present are worse than the problem they are supposed to relieve.  One example is plain aspirin which, he says destroys the cartilage, the "padding" which keeps bones from rubbing together.  This is the most common type called osteoarthritis.  It is thought that eighty percent have this type by the age of fifty, progressing as age does.  It involves hands, spine, hips, knees and feet (primarily in overweight people), and goes back to the cavemen.  Exercise therapy is touted as a natural substitute for medicine, but I know first hand that this type can cause more pain.  Rheumatoid is a disorder or malfunction of the immune system with more inflammation of the joints.  He says that this is most often in women between 25 and 50, with no known cure.  In this type, you have to learn to "conquer" as opposed to "cure."  He really only stresses what we all know, you just have to live with pain at varying times and in varying intensities.  If you try to follow all of his suggestions, not only would you spend all your time trying to locate and consume numerous herbal supplements and expensive foods, but your money, too.  Mort Crim once remarked, "forgiving someone can't change the past but it can transform the future."  Dr. Khalsa tried out this intensive program at the University of Arizona. I think he must have had all female subjects. It is not recommended to use this as a substitute for medical care, as needed, only as some suppositions.  More research is needed, I feel, and I wonder how long his program lasted.  I feel that traditional Pain Management, similar to what I had at Vanderbilt in Nashville is better -- but there is NO cure for pain.  That's an illusion 
 I live in quite a large family also. And yes my family is bigger than this family. But my family and I'm sure many other people with large families will agree with me on this one, none of the "adventures" would really happen in a normal big family. I have 8 younger siblings and 7 older siblings and we are certainly not like them at all 
 Although the author has a fantastic vocabulary and writes well, I feel that she veered off the subject of her CURRENT backyard too often. I had no interest in reading about the glacial age and the history of wolves in Maine and an entire chapter was dedicated to it. Nor was I interested in reports about lawns in Arizona and California, where the author had visited, or facts about the insulation in her house, and the way that fuel usage affects the environment.  However, there are interesting observations presented in a very readable manner, along the way.  If you are interested in native versus non-native plant species, you will learn about them here.  And some stories, like the relationship that develops with a chipmunk, are heartwarming.      In summation:  I felt that many of the subjects written about were not first hand experiences, but rather information that the author gleened from professionals in their respective fields.  I expected something along the lines of a  journal, and something with a stronger timetable, that would represent "A Year on the Lawn".     
 I have loved all Andre Norton works in the past.  This looked like another good book- I was wrong.  The book rambled and was just about the worst book I have ever read.  I'm not sure why I finished it, it was a waste of my life.  I have not read anything by Susan Shwartz but if this book is indicative of her work it does not bode well 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 Tolerance means accepting and no causing to conform to your beliefs. Which is what Muslims do. If Islam was not tolerant, then how are millions of muslims living in America today? How are they living in the same houses, going to American schools, listening to music, having to shop for clothes that are all inches of fabric, having to watch as kids in class make christmas cards in class or carve Halloween jack o lanterns, or not get to go to public swimming areas or Muslims teens not making out with teen guys? Islam makes no move to force anyone. Everyone is trying to confrom you. Everyone assumes that you do celebrate Christmas or eat pepporoni or wear shorts and tank tops. Because they think everyone should be like them and that's all. Sometimes it makes me tired and look back at how I've made it to high school as  Muslim, especially after 9/11. It comes from faith in God, my family, my friends- both Muslim and non-Muslims, and looking at all the good things and stringing those together and making those count more for the bad things. If only people coudl have that outlook on life, the world would not be such a bitter, criticizing place to be wher eeveryone has to constantly defend themselves. I can't seek to change everyone's opinion because it's not our place to tell people what's right and wrong. If you know about the true religion and Allah has opened your heart, it is up to him to let you accept Islam. In the end , if you keep good relations with others and have an open mind, understanding Islam and other religions, will not be a problem for you. And as assurance to other Muslims who are struggling and have become insecure about themselves around unwelcoming people,  " And had your lord so willed, He could surely have made all mankind one single community, but (He willed it otherwise, and so) they continue to have differences-all of the,, save those upon whom your Lord has bestowed HIs grace (by following His guidance on cohabiting with their differences and handling them peacefully). (11:118-119)  That is the simple message of Islam. Diversity is by God's will and it is useless to deabte against others that you are right and they are wrong or you are good and they are bad. Only God knows and that's how it is supposed to be. He will accept those people's prayers even those who aren't Muslims and are good people, we really don't know. No Muslim says if you're not Muslim, you go to Hell. That is completly out of line. ' Kaafir' does not mean infidel or unbeliever as many so called experts and uninformed people believe. It simply mean one who denies the clear fact of God's creation and favors and rejectss His message while realizing within oneself the truth that he/she opposes in words.  I think one of the main reasons people are against Islam and think it unfavorable, is becasue it is so different from our media and pop culture today. Islam to modern society is like an old fashioned time, whien people still read thier holy books, didn't have premarital sex, wore modest clothing, thought highly of educaiton, had good ties with their parents and family and respected their elders. Now in this free society, people want to do anything and can't stand those who have self control and such faith.  islam is easy to embrace if what your goal is , is to worship God in the simplest sense and keep good morals and values and be tolerant to others. Many religions also do this, so it shows islam is not some strange new idea.  thank you 
 I got this tooth brush in a gift bag from a party i went to, and when i tried it out, It didn't work! It would play the music for about 10 seconds, then it would die, and i couldn't turn it back on! It went through the whole song maybe once or twice. The music is also terrible quality. DO NOT BUY THIS 
 When I bought the book I was hoping that it would contain some useful information for me as a first time owner of a Harley-Davidson Sportster. I guess I should have done my homework better because this book did not contain anything useful for me apart from some nice pictures of Sportster models thru the years. So it is a nice coffee table book for people to browse through. I guess I should buy the service manual instead so that I can get some useful info if I want to get my hands dirty working on the Sportster :- 
 This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series. It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.  The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from.   The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not 
 Maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products.  However, this shampoo did not work for me.  Like the previous reviewer said, it was watery and did not lather at all.  It also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard.  I followed up with a hair smoothie, but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair.  I do not recommend this at all 
 The sound is a bit distoted, radio reception is OK. But the headphone cable is too short. The most anoying is that there is now way to keep the unit from changing stations at the slightest touch, CDs and iPods have a hold switch, this item keep going ot the next station with no way to lock it to a station. Also it does not store presets. 
 The alternate title of this book should have been "HOW TO AFFECT AN AIR OF SOPHISTICATION AND URBANITY IN SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF PLODDING AND FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOTTING COUPLED WITH TWO DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES SO PREDICTABLE IN THEIR PRETENTIOUS MUSINGS".   An overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors. I had hopes for these two having started with "Cabinet of Curiosities". Their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but I retained hope for latent talent. Then this? This self-indulgent, conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the socially-upward-mobile.  I am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of Messrs. Preston and Child and perhaps the worst offender of all, Dan Brown 
 	Linda Lawrence Hunt must have had a time machine.  She chronicles Helga and Clara Estby's 1896 walk from Washington State to New York City in her 336 page book Bold Spirit.  She did so, even though all were unavailable to her.  Helga Estby, a Norwegian immigrant, keep many detailed journals during and after her journey, but her family burned them out of spite and shame.  Helga Estby walked across America to receive $10,000.  She planned to use it to pay off the debts she and her husband Ole and their ten children had accumulated.  Or so says Linda Lawrence Hunt.   	Bold Spirit is ten percent fact and ninety percent speculation.  Gleaning from only a few newspaper articles, public records, and a few interviews, Hunt manages to produce a considerably long piece of what she calls non-fiction.  For all we know, Estby planned to use the money to open up an opium den.  Just because the Estby's were struggling financially and Helga was offered $10,000 doesn't mean she planned to use the money to pay off debts.  Sometimes people do things that don't make sense.   	Hunt's "primary sources" are questionable.  Biased and inaccurate press is as much of an American tradition as hot dogs and beer, and it was especially rampant in Victorian America, as literacy rates and newspaper production rates were increasing but rules about unbiased media hadn't been established.  While periodicals help supplement a biographical account, they should not be the foundation of it.  Because time makes memories fade, interviews of family and friends are just as inaccurate. 	Hunt assumes the political views of Estby and her daughter.  She assumes that Helga was a feminist.  Had Helga been as strong of a woman as Hunt portrays, perhaps she would have written a book about her walk, like she had planned.  Perhaps she wouldn't have taken her nineteen-year-old daughter with her on the 3,500-mile walk.  Perhaps she would have opened up a school or started speaking to the community about her walk.  Estby becomes incredibly apathetic after the walk; perhaps she was depressed because of the death of two of her children while she was away.  Perhaps because she and Ole were never able to fix their relationship after she was away for so long.  Perhaps it was because she was raped or hurt on the trip.  No one knows, not even Linda Lawrence Hunt.  This kind of speculative "non-fiction" should not become a precedent in the historical world. 	This book would have been enjoyable if it were historical fiction.  Hunt could have used her imagination as much as she wanted to do pretty much what she did in Bold Spirit: fill in the gaps left by the documents.  She could have spruced up the story and added plot twists.  Her writing style is insultingly simplistic. 	I would recommend this book to a fifth grader.  The writing style is easy enough to understand.  The plot is basic.  On the surface, it is an encouraging tale about a bold, courageous woman.  But anyone interested in historical integrity, an interesting story, or reading anything past a fourth grade reading level should probably stay far far away from Bold Spirit 
 Recently I bought an Epson R260, to replace my Epson R200, big mistake, after only 20 or so prints 4/6, the printer ran out of ink, I mean all six cartridges were almost empty, black was totally out, first I thought, well maybe the cartridges, that came with the original packaging were not totally full, I went out and got me a new set of six cartridges, 100+ dolars. After 26 prints, again out of ink. I used to get about 175 / 200 with the old R200. It is ridiculous, you actually see the ink level go down as you print.  Excelent print quality lousy ink usage.  Did I mention that I was using the lowest possible setting for the quality of prints.  When I contacted Epson, the answer was, GET THE CONTINUOS FLOW INK SYSTEM.  Nice answer 
 I love Seinfeld's sense of humor. I loved the TV show. I own all the available DVD's. I'm eager to see him on stage.  As for this book, if you've seen the show, you will have heard the jokes. I was hoping that the book would have talked about more about his life. I would have liked to read about his relationship with Mike Costanza, the guy who was to a degree the inspiration for the antics of "George Costanza". It would have been nice for Jerry to acknowledge the extent to which Mike Costanza helped Jerry become a success. A good book to read that covers that subject is, "The Real Seinfeld: As Told by the Real Costanza" by Mike Costanza and Greg Lawrence. I strongly recommend that book if you want to read about Jerry's rise to fame and glory.  Sadly, this book doesn't do more than tell us jokes we've already heard. 
 I've enjoyed this author's other books.  I really don't know what was going on with this one, though.  There are so many discrepencies...  One of the character's hair color changed by the end of the book, with no appointment at the salon.  The author has no clue about Harry Potter, or Barney. There are too many to go into here. All of the little things coupled with a slow, ridiculous story equaled a poor read.  Don't waste your time!! 
 I like to find an author and read all their books, not necessarily in order. I find that I get a great liking/disliking for them and decide if I will continue. I found CC's books to be good with the first FBI book I read with Dane Carver. It was good. Damsel in distress and FBI agent friend falls in love with her and they marry all live happily ever after. Then there is the one with the detective, Ben. Guess what,  he falls in love with the damsel in distress and they get married. Then there is Mac and Quinlan, both FBI agent friends of Savich/Sherlock - they too fall madly in love with the women they are protecting/investigating and get married and live happily ever after. Now I am all for a nice romantic twist in a book but it happens in EVERY one. Don't forget the MAZE where Savich and Sherlock fall in love. I did not dislike any of those books but it did get a bit mundane when I started seeing the same outline for the plot there. A lot of the same use of dialogue and words starting popping off the page at me. Just not a lot of new material to hold the interest.   HEMLOCK BAY was just too much to take. I like the characters Savich and Sherlock - they are certainly written as superagents and superparents. I even liked Lily and Simon in this one. BUT and here the big BUT, the plot! It was just too winding, too unrealistic (not even counting the unexplained supernatural things) and just too far fetched. I was disappointed with this read. Will I read more? Well I have one more of the FBI series here to finish the whole set so yes I will. I will not recommend many of them to friends. I think CC had a great thing going and just went off on a tangent as many of the best selling authors do such as Cornwell (was my favorite until the last few books become recipe plots as well), Grafton (who I had to read five to confirm they were as bad as I had thought on the first one) and Patterson (yes even the great one has some that were actual groaners).  I read a lot - a book every day and a half is what it works out to so I buy several at one time. I just found this to be a waste of my time and very depressing that a best selling author would consider this to be up to par. The recipe is now old and needs perked up. Time to change the ingredients and spice it up 
 This pianist is painful to watch and boring to hear. We can only hope he is not the idol of a new generation of classical music listeners. It would be a bad omen for the future ... 
 basically... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! seriously he can't even solo over chord changes! i've heard him compared to the likes over SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 Man I love any blaxplotation but this movie [is bad]. No action no T&A the plot is asinine the sets look like the movie was shot on someones back yard. Good for a rainy Saturday when you don't care if you fall asleep before the movie ends 
 Reagan's campaign autobiography is titled _Where's the Rest of Me?_, based on a line from one of his movies.  Unfortunately, Cannon has amputated a lot of Reagan in the second volume of his biography.  (The other volume is Governor Reagan, and it is much, much better.)  Much of the book is based on leaks, kiss-and-tell interviews, and the various Iran-Contra reports.  As a result, the book is not a fair picture of Reagan but is really the revenge of administration officials.  As a result, the book has a lot of inside information, but Cannon has not put it in context.  Even worse, there is very little of Reagan in the book.  Most of the material describes what Reagan's staff is doing to each other, and there is plenty of in-fighting.  There's very little of Reagan's thoughts or actions.  For example, you get David Stockman's understandably bitter view of economic policy, but there is almost no discussion of the longest postwar economic boom, except an attempt to debunk it.  Mostly he portrays Reagan as asleep and uncomprehending.  It is highly telling that Cannon has not cited in his bibliography any documents from the Reagan library.  He only seems to quote Reagan's diary when it was used by the Tower Board during its investigation of Iran-Contra.  So this is a book about Reagan's chiefs of staff, counselors, and a few cabinet secretaries.  They are interesting people, but it's not a Reagan bio.  My final complaint is that the book is written in stream-of-consciousness.  Cannon describes whatever events he thinks of next, so there is little overall organization to the book.  He jumps years between paragraphs.  For instance, he doesn't mention the air-traffic controller's strike until he is discussing the re-election campaign, when it has only a tenuous connection to the matter at hand.  Major events are hardly covered at all, such as the assassination attempt.  So I still have no overall understanding of the themes and organization of Reagan's presidency.  Nonetheless, the book does have some strengths.  Cannon is an interesting writer, so you'll enjoy his prose.  He also has a lot of interesting inside information gained by his years as a reporter for the Washington Post and many years reporting on Reagan in California.  For example, he seems to have a good understanding of Nancy Reagan, probably because Michael Deaver was a key source.  Also, he provides insightfuly analysis about Iran-Contra, the MX missile deployment, the 1984 re-election, and the first budget.  His discussion of the different types of intelligence and the ones that were strengths for Reagan is very useful.  Note that even the revised version of the book ends with Reagan leaving the presidency in 1989.  It also begins with him taking office in 1981.  Overall, I CANNOT recommend the book.  It might be a good supplement if you already understand Reagan's presidency well.  But if this is the only book you read about him, you'll be left in confusion and with a biased portrait by a reporter who mostly seems to disparage Reagan 
 The subject matter of this book is one which deserves serious exploration.  In fact, the subtitle "Conquering Your Insecurity"  was a big enticement (if only...).  Unfortunately, this book explores and recommends very little.  Once the premise is set forth, that tenderheartedness or toughheartedness is a congenital predisposition, and how it comes about, and how it manifests itself in daily life, (career, relationship, etc.) the book goes no further - just keeps repeating and attempting to substantiate that premise.  The "case studies" used to demonstrate these ideas are WAY too long and utterly lack substance.  It's like when someone says "to make a long story short..." you know you're in for a long, drawn out nothing.  If you're looking for concrete self-help, thought provoking substance and engaging reading, this ain't it. See Marcy Calhoun's "Are You Really Too Sensitive?"  It's substantive, meaningful and useful on this subject.  Best wishes to all who are searching 
 Four months after purchase, the Receiver misfunction and shut down. It was impossible to contact Sherwood Electronics which had no service Centers in the State of Wisconsin. Therefore the warranty was not worth the piece of paper it was written on. Check out  a Sherwood Service center in your state prior to purchase 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?"  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever.

 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 With all respect to Mr. Hawking - this book should never been published. I'm not blaming him, but all others who are responsible it went to market.  Let me explain a little bit  Most of buyers of this book, are buying based on Hawking reputation from "Brief history of time" (which is excellent book). What we have here - pictures which doesn't have any relation with text (at least not valuable and are far to big - taking space in other words, you'll not buy book of 60 pages for 35 USD), changing from one subject to another, explaining the basic things somebody who is reading such a book should already know (spin - 2 pages) and then jumping to complicated things (M-theory - mentioned in 1 row) without explanation. Some jokes and comments I don't understand.  I bought this book 6 months age and came to approx 1/3 of book (poker between Hawking, Newton and I think Einstein). I didn't have nerves to read more ... this is first book in my life I didn't finish.  I never thought I'll write review, especially not like this and especially not for book of Mr. Hawking, but I felt cheated. There are so many other excellent books on same thematic, try them, forget this one.  But anyway, my 3 year old son was extremely happy by disintegrating this book to more then 1000 small pages ... lucky him.   
 Someone gave me this  book when I became pregnant with my  first child  at  age 34.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  This book does absolutely NOTHING to settle the mind of a woman of "advanced maternal age." Get "What to Expect When You're Expecting" instead.  It's gentle and encouraging and most of the info  applies to expectant moms of all ages 
 All the Littermaid products I have owned are cheaply made & break easily.  This is no exception.  I decided to give them another try- the item looked improved from the original big square version of their litter cover.  The plastic is cheap and breaks easily.  The material is flimsy.  My cat peed on it and I washed it, but didn't dry it- it shrunk!!!  and wouldn't fit in the frame anymore- I had to throw the whole thing out after MUCH MUCH frustration trying to get the thing back together.  Definitely don't waste your money on ANY Littermaid products 
 I was forced to read this in high school and it was awful.  The characters behave idiotically as if they have no common sense.  Liberals including my literature teacher love this book because of of the pro-communist and "blame the white man" views.  I'm not white, and I still found it impossible to relate to Bigger.  Young adults would enjoy books more if they weren't forced to read bad novels like this 
 nice boots, soft, warm inside, but too bad they sent me two different sizes! i have 11.5 mens, and they sent me a mens 11 and a mens 12 and i ordered size 12.   boo hoo. 
 This movie wasn't a good sequel to the 2001 first part, which was much, much better. In this movie she forgets about the whole Beverly Hills girl who reads Cosmo and makes up 6 times a day...this time she became more serious and this isn't a movie funny as the first one, besides, the whole gay dog thing was so out of place!  The story should have been about some Elle's problem, not her dog's. Plus, it was so obvious that she was going to save her and all the dogs and stuff 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 As a novice biker, trying to understand how to maintain and repair my bike, this book was almost useless to me.  There is not even a diagram of a bike naming all its parts!  The authors have assumed that the reader has  some knowledge which is a huge mistake.  Sorry, lads.  You're going to have  to do a lot better to come up with a book that's clear, easy to read, and,  much more fun than yours is 
 This book might be the worst book I have read in years. Susan Roane has filled 240 pages with more or less obvious information like OAR approach. Observe, Ask a Question, Reveal your Thought. I don't wanna spend much time on reviewing this book, but I'll tell you: If you expect something that analyzes, refers to any scientific papers (or any stuidies at all) or puts any psychological aspects in the mix, then forget this book 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 Bought a bandana that, if memory serves, was not clearly marked as a "costume" item. So, it's a little different than I expected, but it's not necessarily bad. Shipping, etc., werew great. 
 Wow, another book on the TG world (anticipation, anticipation)! Then -- letdown. Just imagine how your maiden aunt, or a conservative suburban club-woman, might see the transgendered world of (mostly) early Baby-Boomers as filtered through the observations of a TG-bashing mentor, i.e. the self-styled Canadian "sex scientist" Ray Blanchard. Sorry, it just doesn't live up to its promise as a fitting explication of the subject, and its WAY too short to do so, even had it gone seriously into understanding TG/TS/CD folk.  A work of clever opinion, but little social merit. My significant other and I had a few good laughs over this one 
 The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex 
 This movie is not worth Sam Elliot.  I was very dissapointed, I will most likely thow it away 
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 I ordered HOW for a graphic designer friend's birthday in January and it is near the end of March and she still has not received anything...  so we have no idea how the product is... we have not seen it 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 This book is full of lies, written by people who have no idea what they are talking about. I would recomend that they actually visit this country before they speak about it 
 Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
 My grandson is 11 and he just isn't interested in this game.  I bought both of the River Crossing games, for Christmas, and he hasn't even looked at the second one 
 I used this book in preparing for an anthropology paper on women's roles in Japan, and regretted the choice.  (As a quick note, I have been dragged to several hostess clubs while employed at a Japanese company.)  The anthropology itself is pretty sloppy- the author seems oblivious to the fact that, as a westerner (before westerners became common in hostess clubs), her interactions will be extremely different from what normally happens in such clubs.  The book is long on theory, but short on observation.  I can not recommend it as anthropology, or as an accurate observation on Japanese sexuality 
 I've read all 6 of the books, I think they're great!  But why would you spend $100 on a 6 book box set... when there are 7 books in the series?  Better to hold off on buying the box set until is a... complete set.  But maybe that's just me.    2 Stars because the books are incredible 
 I bought this game hoping to have another great game for my girlfriend and I (we became bored playing backgammon all the time) and we are disappointed.  This game has nothing to do with any lost cities.... it's just a card game that requires you to stack cards in numeric order to get points...  you group the cards by color (which are supposed to represent cities????) and eventually the game ends after a certain number of cards are played and you tally up a bunch of numbers, divide that by pi, and then take the square root of you birth year and multiply that by five to see if you have either earned points or need to subtract them.  Then you do the math for your partner.    We tried to play it a few times and it was just kinda dumb.... (The points arn't that difficult really!), but this game was a waste of time and twenty some odd dollars.   I suggest you take the $20 and buy a bottle of hooch, and have some real fun with your partner... unless you are 8 years old... in which case this game might be fun.  Just Terrible 
 I know that looking at books may help mostly from great artist. Don't misunderstood, Glenn Fabry is a very good artist.  But, here is the bad thing about this book. You are looking at his art from his sketch book, and yes you can see his style of art. The drawings you see are referenced from videos.  He doesn't give any help about the understanding the placement of muscles, shadows, etc. Because he doese not explain about them   Please, please, please! avoid it! It is usefull if you have a anatomy class and need different poses to copy from. But their are other books which will extremely help you like books from Cristopher Hart (Drawing Cutting Edge Anatomy, Drawing Cutting Edge Comics, etc. 
 Two days ago I used a bag of Zorb that had come with my Dyson a year or two ago.  Maybe this stuff spoils? It left the most foul smell, smells like my father-in-laws basement, on the lake, with the leak, that he never used to go in to.   We poured an entire box of baking soda on the floor in my daughter's room, but you can still smell it throughout the entire house. It's nauseating. It even seems like when I went to work this morning the smell had gotten into my clothes and went with me!  I love my Dyson, but boy, this Zorb stuff, peee-yewwwwww!!!! 
 I'll admit I was a bit skeptical going into this book after learning that Mr. Loriega was a student of Ronald Duncan, who's generally regarded as a rather... controversial... figure in the martial arts communty.  However, I figured that so long as there is historical documentation to back up the information in the book, it may make a good addition to my library.  Unfortunately, the book does indeed suffer from a rather glaring credibility gap.  As stated in other reviews, the few techniques shown are taken from the 1849 "Manual del Baratero".  In addition to this, descriptions of Spanish "knife culture" are provided from contemporary travel guides penned by French and English authors. However, beyond that, most of the information is solely derived from the late Maestro Don Santiago Rivera.  We are expected to accept without question bold statements about the superiority of the "Sevillian School" of knife fighting over all other Spanish methods, and by extension (according to Mr. Loriega's recknoning), all other Mediterranean styles of knifeplay.  This "My kung fu is better than your kung fu" attitude is prevalent in the book, though most writers and practitioners of European martial arts take pains to avoid such chest-beating.   The other reviews also mention that the book is full of anecdotes, and as I was expecting these to be historical accounts of navaja encounters (we have volumes of such things regarding swordplay), I was again disappointed.  Rather, we are treated to numerous stories from the author's time training in Seville, which to be perfectly honest, sound like they've been taken from various "Zorro" movies.  Sadly, in order to verify any of this, one would have to fly to Seville, and even this would be a shot in the dark, as the author provides no contact information for the Escuela Sevillana de Armas Biancas, or any other knife school in Spain.    These major issues aside, there are a couple of other curiosities thrown into the mix.  One is a short discussion on the relationship between knife fighting and sex.  Another is a fictional (and historically inaccurate) story set in the mid-15th century of a Moor, a Gypsy, and Courtier discussing the merits of their various weapons (scimitar, razor blade, and rapier, respectively) and deciding to combine them into what would become the navaja.  Mr. Loriega also includes a story of himself being rude to a shopkeeper in Nice, France.  In the end, it would be best to skip over this book and purchase Mr. Loriegas translation of the "Manual del Baratero" instead (provided you ignore the translator's rather smug remarks on the inferiority of previous translations).  My favorite line of the book?  "Even the deadliest .357 Magnum is less than worthless in the hands of child who cannot hold it to fire."  Hurray for gun safety! 
 This book is horrible. The author has many inaccuracies, for example, Boulanger opened his restaurant in 1765, not 1745 as Linda indicates. She completely leaves out the Ottoman Turks who play a significant role in the Crusandes and cuisine, and she constantly bounces back and forth with dates and places. If you are a hobbyist and have time to spare, you may want to start reading to form your own opinion, however if you seriously want to know about the true history of food, I would not recommend this book 
 I ORDERED OFA 2005, 2006, 2007 AND RECEIVED ONLY THE LAST TWO. THEY ARE GREAT, EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED. I CANNOT COMMENT ON 2005 BECAUSE IT NEVER GOT TO ME 
 Like most skeptics, Kammann and Marks pretend objectivity, when their real mission is to debunk every aspect of the field of parapsychology. For instance, they have zero belief on any level in the possibility of such things as telepathy and remote viewing. For them, it is not possible, so they set out to simply prove this assumption. Yet, simple physics allows for the possibility of some form of thought transference. Just as energy in the form of thoughts transfers from one part of the brain to another part via the neurotransmitters, why wouldn't it be possible for the corresponding molecular frequency to be picked up by another brain? The evidence for telepathy between twins or during dreams is overwhelming, but they ignore it all. See, for instance, Dream Telepathy by Ulmann, Krippner and Vaughan. So, in their attempts to pretend objectivity, Marks and Kammann really set out with the key goal of trying to debunk Uri Geller. They use as their proof  photographs that are so blurred that it is impossible to see what the photographs are of, yet these, they assert "prove" that Geller is a fake. It is shameful. Try reading Charles Panati's The Geller Papers if you want the truth about how Mr. Geller did in physics laboratories across the globe.  The problem with these types of skeptics is that they live in the mutual admiration society world without realizing that they are not true skeptics but rather narrow thinkers who wall off any chance of discovering anything of value by chanting Groucho Marx' famous credo: "What ever it is, I'm against it! 
 I saw this movie at the Tampa International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 2005.  It was the WORST movie of the Festival -- even most of the Board of Directors thought so.  It somehow slipped through the cracks.  One of my friends, who is Italian by birth and speaks French fluently, was so turned off by the movie that he refused to come to the Festival for the next night's foreign film.  THAT movie, Cote d'Azur, was excellent.   But back to Three Dancing Slaves - ugh, yuck and no thanks!  Senseless, violent content and not a gay movie at all.    
 I read most of the book last night and was disturbed by several things - The author deliberately blurs the line between "Arab" and "Muslim." He calls non-Arabs "whites," and makes whites sound like low class, trailer trash, uneducated red necks. Aren't Arabs white? I was offended that he mentioned Danny Thomas as an example of all the fine Arab people who have come to US to find a better life. Yes, Danny Thomas was Arab, but not a Muslim. Maharidge quotes an Arab comedian as saying that there's so much discrimination against Arabs. But unless they point out that they are an Arab, how would one even know? How can you treat someone different, unless they point out how different they are?   I have personal involvement in two of the stories quoted in the book, and know that facts presented are incorrect. I think it's grossly incompetent and irresponsible for an author to present a work of nonfiction without verifying his information.  Knowing that some of the facts are wrong, I would look at the rest of the book with reservation. Maharidge treats those he perceives to be the underdog with sympathy, but paints those who speak against them as ignorant, uneducated bigots.  Maharidge's premise that contemporary America dangerously resembles the Weimar Republic, or "Heimat," that led to Nazi Germany is an oversimplification of the current government of the US.  This proposition is deliberately anti-administration, inflamatory, and a grab for publicity. 
 I got this book to read out loud to my children.  They seem to enjoy it (after all, Blackwell's story is fascinating and inspiring!), but I have been disappointed.  The characters are rather flat, there is a lot of  repetition, and the author moralizes a great deal.  I have ended up reading  only excerpts from it as I can't stand to slog through the whole thing.   Although the book has been informative on the barriers that Blackwell  overcame and on her accomplishments, I wish there was more social,  historical, and medical context 
 I was excited about getting this book but what a disappointment!! Photos were mediocre at best and there was nothing inspiring that gets the juices going for dedorating with her ideas.  It is not a book worth looking at more than once, but even at that I woldn't bother.  Buy this book if you want to adore Susan Sargent and pay a big sum to just have a book with her name on it.  I love decorating and this rates low on my book list.  Sorry if I offend some with being candid, but I prefer to give a my true assessment and hope someone else doesn't waster his/her hard urned money on this book.  Take a look at it at a book store before being lured to buying it based on a name and a nice cover. 
 Sebastian Mallaby certainly can tell a story and is an excellent writer.  Unfortunately, in his latest book on the World Bank and its President, his sharp and witty pen is often aimed squarely at the wrong target.    In order to maintain his narrative thread, Mallaby resorts to broadside attacks on any non-governmental organization that has the gall to critique Bank projects and policies, and insist that the Bank adhere to minimum social and environmental safeguards when dealing with the overwhelmingly corrupt, authoritarian regimes that comprise its borrowers.  It is disturbing that he would choose to "shoot the messenger" (i.e. the NGOs) rather than take an honest look at their valid concerns. In this way, Mallaby does both the Bank and his readers a disservice.  Despite the heavily footnoted text, he ignores inconvenient facts and information that is readily available, and uses clever put-downs and caricatures to demean the NGO community when he cannot respond to their genuine concerns with a viable argument.  His examination of a Chinese government-sponsored population transfer project in an historically Tibetan area is a particularly egregious example of the excesses and intellectual dishonesty of Mallaby's book.  It is most unfortunate that such a gifted writer approached such an important topic with such an incredible bias.  Too bad that Mr. Mallaby did not put his cleverness to better use 
 this book is okay for a beginners intro to iran but it misconstrues completely some of the facts of iranian history.  mossdaegh did NOT assume dicatatorial powers, and at times it seems that ms mackey feels sympathy for the shah.  the crimes of SAVAK, the shah's secret police, arent well documented either.  dont waste your money- I recommend THE LAST GREAT REVOLUTION by Robin wright or PERSIAN MIRRORS by Elaine Sciolin 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 I liked White Oleander so much that as soon as Paint it Black became available, even tho I'm committed to buying used books as an environmental measure, I had to have it right away and so bought the hard-cover.  Having read it, I must say I'm more than a little disappointed.  For me, Josie never really came alive, nor did Michael.  Most of the actions of the people in this story didn't make sense or didn't ring true.  Unlike the characters in White Oleander, I never cared much about any of these characters.  The story is pretty stagnant; I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Instead, all of the dropped hints earlier never get picked up.  Just as I was almost done reading the book, I thought, "OK, there's still time to reveal a shocker:  maybe Michael's mother tracked him down at the motel and, realizing that he could not escape her, he killed himself."  But no, the story just fizzles out.  We are left wondering if Josie's suspicions are true about Michael and his mother.  And how thick could this supposedly street-smart girl be if she didn't figure out until hundreds of pages after the reader did, that the housekeeper cared deeply about her wellbeing?! 
 In "Using Terri", Jon Eisenberg attempts to provide the reader with insight into the legal, ethical, moral, and medical aspects of the tragic death of Terri Schiavo.   He falls far short of the mark on all of them.  In his November 6, 2005 review for the New York Times William Saletan succinctly sums up the book:  ""Using Terri" is just another use of Terri."   Eisenberg begins with the death of his 79 year old aunt Ros trying to draw a parallel between her and Terri.  The situations could not be more different.  No one, not Eisenberg, nor her two brothers had any desire to care for Ros.   Her case is indeed tragic and agonizing.  Had she not been dehydrated to death her fate would most probably have been to remain institutionalized and uncared for until she finally succumbed to a sad end.  A very different fate awaited Terri were she to be delivered into the care of her parents and siblings.  She would have received the best loving care and devotion that her parents could lavish on her; she would have most probably lived a long life, giving love to all those around her and perhaps even being able to receive the love that was lavished upon her.  But Eisenberg and the bioethics community would have us believe that Terri's life was a life "not worthy of life".   They are absolutely certain, beyond all doubt, that a severely brain damaged person is, in fact not a person at all.   He or she is simply a vegetable to be treated as an inanimate object.  Vegetables, like pet rocks, and tomatoes can never receive love.  Vegetables do not have, nor should they have, access to the rights and privileges that "normal" people take for granted.  This certainty permeates Eisenberg's book at every level and every page.  Symptomatic of this certainty is the obscenely arrogant inscription placed by Michael on Terri's tombstone which reads "Born December 3, 1963, departed this earth February 25 1989, at peace March 31, 2005."     What Eisenberg and so many in the bioethics community conveniently forget is that all too often the most horrendous acts of cruelty and evil are committed by those that, like them, are absolutely certain that what they are doing is good and just.  Jacob Bronowski devotes a chapter in his classic work "The Ascent of Man" to the issue of knowledge and uncertainty.   In describing the Nazi horror he stands in swamp outside the crematorium at Auschwitz and declares:   "When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods... We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and power."       If you feel you must read this book I would at least urge you to exam impartially the other side.  Read Wesley Smith; read David Galenter, read Dr. Daniel Eisenberg; read Jacob Bronowski; read Rita Marker, and yes read father Frank Pavone whom Eisenberg so brutal and unjustly demonizes.   They are my heroes.   And question Eisenberg's statements, his description of the events, his conclusions and especially his demonizing of those who disagree with him.  Sometimes one's motives and philosophies can be revealed in the most trivial passages.  There is one such sentence that especially struck me in "Using Terri"; on p 191 Eisenberg describes the scene at the hospice on the last day of Terri life:  "A woman blew on a shofar - a ritual horn sounded by the ancient Hebrews during battle."   As a Jew and as human being I find such appalling ignorance of my religion deeply insulting.  But in a wider sense perhaps it is symptomatic of Eisenberg's utter contempt for everything that does not fit into a purely secular framework and does not worship at the altar of the false god of autonomy.    
 This booklet was offered as a bundle with another book I purchased.  The booklet itself is well done, but not very extensive re: the wildlife of Costa Rica.  It seemed to be a bit pricey to me, even at a discounted rate, for what I received 
 No children... bought this mobile for my office, I'm setting my sights on the final frontier.  A better mobile might exist, but I never found it.  The mobile consists of cardstock photos from NASA; I would not say it is durable, but it hangs from the ceiling so that should not be a deterent... as children should probably not be hanging from the ceiling anyway.  It's easy to put together if you have two sets of hands and hangs beautifully once in place.  Unlike a lot of the other mobiles I saw, this one has a sun... nice touch.  I would highly recommend this product.  The world needs more mobiles 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 Matthew von Unwerth's precocious book rehashes (and often repeats two and three times) facts already well known about Freud, Rilke, and Lou Andreas-Salome. It relies on an admittedly charming ramble through various episodes in the lives of these major characters, and there isn't a single clumsy sentence in the whole. But FREUD'S REQUIEM lacks something one would think an editor would demand, namely a thesis. To claim that a probably fictional walk -- Rilke and Freud strolling along together -- has an "invisible history" is not a thesis, and in fact Von Unwerth quickly shows us that Freud incorporated several experiences into the story of the walk in his essay "On Transience." Von Unwerth rubs two sticks together -- Freud's notions of mourning (confrontation and acceptance of loss, as spelled out in his essay) in tension with Rilke's desire for a truth beyond mere existence. Von Unwerth seems uncertain about the very antitheses between Freud and Rilke he otherwise insists upon -- which, of course, might have yielded an original insight into the material if the author had the ability to find one. It is as if he is prodding the reader to synthesize material and provide critical thought in absence of his talent to do so. One of the overheated blurbs says the book is a "well-informed meditation." This is a euphemism for "factual drift" -- lots of facts, no insight. For insights into the contentious and complementary relationship between literature and psychoanalysis, read the stimulating, unsentimenalized essays of Adam Phillips. Von Unwerth loves an anecdote; why does he describe the last days of Freud in London, and how do these facts illuminate the thesis he fails to provide? His understanding of Rilke's poetry is so pedestrian as to serve only his simplistic (and boringly repeated) image of Rilke and Freud as polar opposites. The only glimmer of creativity comes toward the end of the book, as he suggests (tantalizingly, but alas, sputteringly) that Lou had seen the potential for a synthesis of the two men's positions on art and poetry. His final sentence: "In learning to give himself over to the symphony of life and death, he [Freud] rediscovers himself, and so realizes the potential inherent in all beings to love and work." Is that so? In all beings? I think not, and Von Unwerth gives at least one striking example where Freud thought otherwise, too. But Von Unwerth can't help himself, symphony and all. A fluent but sophomoric attempt 
 I have spent a ton of money learning from the best marketers regarded in the world. This book is laughable in my humble opinion 
 I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.  This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.  Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.  This is my last Cromwell 
 Granted, I saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party, but I think I had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was. It's so... bad. It has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved, and the script was just awful. Gosh, it's hard to believe I actually sat through it. It was just so... exactly what it was, I guess. A stupid sex comedy that's absolutely terrified to be anything else. The thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material. I think my real downfall here was the fact that I'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys. The scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it's almost ridiculous. Now, I'm not one to get offended easily, but this just took it a bit too far. Just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed, which isn't really something I look for in a movie. It just seems to me that if 'gay' had been replaced with 'black', this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn't ever have been released. Not that I'm condoning censorship, but when your tone becomes so... mocking, I guess. Oh well, I guess all I'm trying to say is I will definitely not be repeat viewing this film, and I don't recommend you view it at all if you're a woman, or gay, or you care about others 
 I sat down in Borders and read this in half an hour.  I am a huge Tolkien fan, and know all his works backward and forward, and this was such a terrible thing to see shelved in the bookstore.  It mistranslates names, gets dates and events screwed up, and is simply a terrible reference material.  If you want to know about Tolkien's Middle-earth, pick up Tolkien's books and *read* the things.  Don't take this crappy short-cut 
 The book I received in July, 2006 was published in 2004 - NOT 2005, as indicated. It doesn't contain contain any information that you can't get from other guidebooks - and the information on specific sites is sketchy. Maybe it is useful if you plan on touring on a motorcycle, but otherwise, there are more current guidebooks covering the same places more effectively 
 Though the design is cool, the quality of this pendant is poor.  They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper.  They look like toys!  I also bought the earrings set with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both.  :-(  Only the packaging is of good quality in this product.  I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design.  
 I found the book "A Gathering of Days" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me. 
 Thought I would love this book, as I've loved Deborah Madison's newest, Vegetarian Suppers. This book was a disappointment--lots of simple recipes, but nothing that sounded like hey, I've got to try that! You probably have recipes similar to these in the book if you have a few vegetarian cookbooks anyway. I brought this one back to the store (a rarity for me--I'm a cookbook fiend!) 
 I am sure that this book will serve the needs of most of the buyers as a competent treatment of the subject area. I am studying for the exam and wanted two things: A large set of practice questions for drill purposes (the cd had 30 questions) and a portable reference copy of the book. The ebook included can only by read from the cd according to the text file that comes with it, but in fact for me the book was totally unreadable from the CD on a PC or a Mac with serveral different versions of the adobe reader that I tried. I am not interested in reading a 900 page book just to pass an exam and found that the dummies book plus the testking questions were enough. This book did not suit my needs at all 
 As a fan of Geaorge Martin's magnum opus, A Song of Ice and Fire, I was excited to read Windhaven. It is a story of one girl's efforts to turn tradition upside down and join an elite group of airborne messengers. There is a lot of whining and hand wringing with the central character able to see all sides of an argument to an almost pathological degree. The settings and the premise are interesting, but the characters never get beyond two dimensions. There are some crazy time shifts too, where decades pass withoiut warning. As an exercise in showing how our actions, no matter how noble, can be the source of pain and anguish, it worked. A ripping yarn it is not 
 As i read the book, i realized that Mr Hibbert was not going to give me a very good account of the Queen.He constantly talks about the Queen's changing moods, her dislikes for some of her prime ministers and her treatment of her servants.To me this things are a waste of time.Mr Hibbert fails to tells us how the Queen felt about the political situation of Europe in her time.The author very rarely mentions her views on the different wars England waged during her time. At times i felt like i was reading a gossip column on a supermarket tabloid.Mr Hibbert wastes too many chapters on things like her servants, dinner parties and the sort.The book is too tight since most of the times it covers the Queen's opinion of non-important things 
 This book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book (this has been noted by others) Anything of interest is said in the first chapter, followed by a lot of fluff - "sometimes the crowd is wise" "sometimes the crowd is not wise".  After the first chapter, I seriously couldn't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored 
 We read this book for our book club, and the overall feeling was that it was a quick, easy read, but very predictable and a little over the top.  We all agreed that we wouldn't be passing this book on to friends to read as we did not enjoy it that much 
 I ONLY READ THIS BOOK B/C I HAD TO FOR ONE OF MY MANY ENGLISH COURSES, AND IT WAS EXTREMLEY BORING! MAYBE B/C I JUST IM NOT ATTRACTED TO BOOKS ABOUT POLITICS, AND IN THIS CASE FASCHISM.I'LL GIVE LEWIS THE CREDIT FOR PREDICTING WHATS ALREADY SEEMING TO HAPPEN IN 2006 U.S.A, BUT THIS BOOK IS PRETTY DANG BORIN'...SORR 
 Five stars for the music but reduced to one star for content and value.    Value???  At around $135 this box set to mark Tony Bennett's 80th birthday year is obviously aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan / collector, rather than at the casual buyer.  With that in mind one is left wondering what exactly it was that Sony/Columbia thought they were giving to us that was so special?  What we have ended up with is a frustratingly mixed bag.  Firstly, the packaging.    The picture on Amazon seems to be an early mock up of the set, as the finished product is more elaborate.  The box is a cube covered in black velour with Bennett's signature embossed into the top.  The front of the box has a perspex panel with a pencil portrait of the singer.  Behind this is a montage of miniature album covers and photos, set slightly back from the panel to give a 3D effect.  Above this on the top front surface of the box is a small silver metallic plate with Bennett's signature.    In the base of the box is a ribbon tag which when pulled reveals a small, hard backed book of approximately 60 pages, again covered in black velour with another small silver metallic plate featuring the singer's signature.  Contents of the book are a collection of charcoal and pencil sketches by the singer and a collection of brief (and I do mean brief) hand-written personal comments on the albums included in the set.  All very nice, but as a fan of the music I would have prefered recording information, anectdotes about the original album releases, session details, etc.      At approximately 7.5" x 7.5" x 7.5", the box will be an awkward if not impossible fit on the shelf beside the rest of your CDs.  OK - so what about what we really came here for, namely, the music?  This is where the above mentioned frustration comes in.  Let's take it album by album.  First of all there are several already available CDs, but in digitally remastered form, some with and some without bonus tracks.  These are:  I Left My Heart In San Francisco - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   The Art of Excellence - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   Perfectly Frank - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   MTV Unplugged - Two bonus cuts ("Just a Little Street Where Old Friends Meet" / "When Will the Bells Ring for Me?") and  slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  The Movie Songs - Two bonus cuts ("A Time for Love" / "The Shining Sea") and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  Then we have a selection of albums that come under the banner of "pointless" as they have already been available for some time, already previously remastered:  Cloud Seven - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Beat of My Heart - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  If I Ruled the World: Songs for the Jet Set - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album - An even more puzzling inclusion.  Not a Columbia release, but recorded for the Fantasy label in the '70s.  This is the original Fantasy CD release, not even repackaged for the box set by Columbia.  It's just as if they bought a bunch of these from Fantasy and popped them into this collection.  However, and again frustratingly, this is NOT the 20 Bit remastered edition of this CD that has been available for several years but the non-remastered, sonically inferior release from the late '90s.  Perhaps Fantasy had a few thousand of these that they couldn't get rid of because they had been superseded by the remastered edition and unloaded them on Sony/Columbia?  Whatever the reason this is a slipshod inclusion in the set, to say the least.  Next is one album already previously released and remastered, but here in a slightly amended form.  I Wanna Be Around - No noticeable difference in sound quality, but with different bonus cuts from the previous release.  The previous CD release of this album included as a bonus, seven tracks from the "This Is All I Ask" album, a somewhat bizzarre and half-baked addition, as all of the  tracks from "This Is All I Ask" would have fitted on to the disc making a two-on-one release.  For the box set release we have three different bonus tracks "If I Love Again" (alternate take) / "Someone To Love" (alternate take) / "Indian Summer".  So - if you want all of the bonus material you have to hold on to your (now deleted) previous CD release of this album.  The next album again comes under the heading of totally pointless:  The Singles Collection - considering this box set is aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan and not the casual buyer (casual buyers don't drop $135 on a whim), another "Greatest Hits" variant is completely pointless.  Something tells me that the people likely to be forking over their hard-earned moolah for this box will already have everything on this disc, probably several times over.  Heaven forbid Sony/Columbia should have given the fans something so outrageous as a disc of rare and unreleased tracks instead of this, their umpteenth hits compilation.   Finally, two albums that finally deliver the goods for the fans.  Tony Bennett Sings for Two - Briefly available on CD many years ago but rapidly withdrawn for some reason.  This remastered version offers significant improvement in sound quality over the previous release.  When Lights are Low - first time ever relese anywhere in the world on CD (so far as I can ascertain).  An absolute gem.  More of this type of album -i.e. never before available on CD- is what this collection needed.  So - what do we have at the end of the day for the Bennett faithful?  One previously unavaiable on CD release and one long unavailable on CD album,  three albums in exactly the same form they are already avaiable in,  one album in an inferior version to what is already available, one album with different bonus cuts to its previous release, five albums with remastered sound (two with bonus cuts) and, finally, one totally pointless "hits" collection.    Considering that approximately thirty Tony Bennett albums have never had a CD release, many more are long deleted on the format and bearing in mind the considerable amount of unreleased material in the vaults, this collection is a completely botched undertaking, a missed opportunity and a pretty shoddy commemoration of the man's 80th birthday.  Just exactly who executive producer Danny Bennett and Sony/Columbia are aiming this box set at is a bit of a mystery.  If it is the dedicated fan, then I have to tell all parties involved in this release that we expect a lot more than two unavailable albums, a collection of already avaialble cleaned up recordings and seven -count'em folks- previously unavailable tracks for our $135.  Just what are the chances, I wonder, of Tony Bennett's back catalogue making it to CD before his original fanbase -or for that matter his newer devotees- are all in their graves?   This is a sorry monument to a great artist's 80th year.  (AFTERTHOUGHT: I'm still puzzled over the unusual number of discs in the set, namely, thirteen.  Not a dozen, not twenty. but thirteen.  Go figure.  You know what they say about the number 13 - "...unlucky for some...".  In this case the unlucky ones are Mr Bennett's fans.)                  
 I was expecting a well composed novel and ended up with a story instead. Have you ever been stuck on the telephone with a friend who insisted on reporting a personal story in a rambled manner while you have better things to do with your time? Or better yet, just get completely bored with the whole thing and hang up as quickly as possible? That's what I felt like while reading this novel. The composition of this novel was, at best, junior high level. And, to top it off, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and was unable to conjure up any interest in her ongoing blah blah blah about what street she was walking or driving through. I think I'm going to take BART to the city and abandon the book somewhere in Chinatown 
 Hi,  I have used this book among others to get accepted to McKinsey (and with success) and I think this book gave me less then others.  The advantages are the more or less detailed frameworks chapter and the real-life interviews chapter, but the cases themselves are rather superficial and sometimes even obviously ridiculous(like for example the case in which a Star-Trek like omnipotent people transporter has been invented, and the book claims that it wouldn't replace cars because it costs 100,000$. Come on, they would buy one for every block). I think there are much better resources than this.  Good luck with your interviews 
 I have read all buy 1, and felt this was the weakest.  It was still good, but lacked in a lot of ways.... 
 The compositions, Rhythms and singin-style of Peter Cetera sound always the same. He is a typical sappy love song - singer who prefers the love ballads and cheesy love adventures. it might have been a bit tedious and boring.  The problem is everywhere: If you are a Hardrock fan like bands Uriah Heep, Stevie Ray Vaughan, AC/DC, Rory Gallagher, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, your ears can't be familar with all these silly love songs. My ears cannot work like that.  there are two alternatives: - if you are a hardrock fan. You like a mythological lyrics, you won't like Peter Cetera or Chicago. Keep your fingers away from this !!! - if you are a sappy love song fan then please buy this cd !! 
 Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
 Oh man... this book was absolutely terrible. I was expecting to learn a little bit about the lives of homeless people-- you know-- all of the suffering that they endure etc., etc. Instead, what you get here is a story about a homeless man and how he works for a newspaper. He goes on and on discussing his position at the newspaper and never really elaborates on anything else. At first, I couldn't put the book down. I was patiently waiting for some intriguing stories about life as a homeless man. Then I decided to put the book down about 3/4 of the way through. I gave up. Boring, boring, boring. This book will cure anyone's insomnia-- it put me to sleep- that's for sure. ZZZzzzzzz.... 
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 A big disappointment.After filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the "warmer" as advertized.It was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place.I returned it for a refund 
 I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan; this is not one of her better stories.  The book jacket summary sounded very interesting to me, it had real potential to be a lighthearted, intriguing romance.  The book started out decent enough, I immediately liked the main character, Cate, and fell for her and her crazy Irish family.  At the same time I was falling for the Madigan's I was introduced to a not so loveable character, Patrick Pugg.  This guy is so annoying it really takes away from the rest of the story.  I feel he was inserted into the story to garner some laughs; unfortunately he had the opposite effect on me.  He constantly refers to himself in the third person, everything is "Pugg this" and "Pugg that."  It was exhausting and exasperating to read!  He had absolutely zero redeeming qualities; any normal person would have sprayed this guy with mace and taken out a restraining order.  For you Plum fans, think of all the faults and quirks of the character Albert Kloughn, add a few more, than multiply and magnify by 100.    The rest of the characters were endearing and likeable.  Kellen McBride is a loveable hero and it's easy to see why he and Cate are so attracted to one another.  The whole mystery of the missing drag queen roommate and the other surprises (don't want to spoil anything) also had some potential, but ended up falling flat for me.  The ending and the wrap up of the mystery was completely unbelievable and ridiculous.  And just when I'd think it couldn't get any more far fetched, it would.   While I know this is fiction, and I appreciate the land of make believe, I always prefer a little reality in my books.  The humor and the dialogue seemed really forced and childish to me.  Nothing in this book made me laugh out loud, like I normally do with a Janet read, I barely smiled at some parts.  Another problem with this story was the introduction of yet another dog.  I was happy this one didn't resort to the normal dog antics, but the dog thing is getting a bit stale for me.  Not the worst book I have read, but far from the best. If you're dying to read this book, I recommend borrowing it from a friend or your local library.

 This book attempts to cover the amount of theory that would require a shelf of books to cover adequately.  As a result, it basically only gives the definitions and results (theorems without proofs) in each topic, something that one could get for free from online encyclopedias.  There are problems with partial solutions, but they are not problems that a student who is exposed to the topics for the first time can solve.  Since there are no proofs of theorems or examples, one cannot solve those problems from studying from this book alone, so why even put those problems in?  To me this seems like a book that the author wrote to summarize the author's knowledge (if the author has really indeed memorized this plethora of information???), while there is no way of understanding what the topics are about if you are reading the topics for the very first time.  To master all the topics in this book would require years of serious studying, so you are better off buy books that specialize in these topics 
 The quality of all the movies is poor-comparable to or worst than VCD. I watched the first 2 dices and lost interest in the rest of the movies. It is more worthy to buy 1 good DVD movie than 50 lousy poor quality classic.  
 I received the printer (as a great gift) on January 16th, I set it up and it wouldn't print - the ink cartridge holder seemed stuck in place.  I called Epson who shipped me out a replacement with no charge or delay.  I used that printer for two weeks and it quit.  Same problem with the ink cartridge holder.  Once again Epson customer service shipped me a new replacement printer.  It worked for another two weeks and quit on me yesterday (same problem).  So, I'll call Epson when they open tomorrow and try to upgrade to a new/different printer or try once again. The printing results are spectacular, especially when using Epson 4* glossy paper.  Anyone else with problems? 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 I generally really enjoy Evanovich's books - I love the Plum series and have read every single one.  Having finished all of those, I moved on to the Full Series hoping to read some more fun Janet novels.  The first three Fulls were ok but this one was so bad!  How does Abby end up with Wes?  I have no idea because the guy is a complete stranger but all of a sudden she trusts him and is in love with him?!  She believes he is a photographer but she allows him to get mixed up with her husband's murder investigation?!  The rest of the characters and story are slightly entertaining but the love story really lost me.  It just didn't seem authentic to the story 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 as a student i was addicted to Jackie Collins while i normally cant stand trash. why are her books different? her characters are so bitchy is one reason. although set in hollywood she is always writing about jewish north london just as simenon's paris is really liege. gina germaine psychopath and nymphomaniac will always represent my ultimate heartthrob. i wondered whether she reappears in the recent sequel 
 This poetry has no redemption or beauty. It is dry, sarcastic, dismal, and plain out unhealthy to the mind. It's not worth it. Read poetry that moves you to understanding, not this 
 This is my second book by Moore that I've read.  I have found him to be an alternative thinker.  He writes some great things criticizing the course of modern society however some of his positions on morals are just unthinkable for a former monk.  I agree with the reviewer who questions Moore's advice to the women whose husband was cheating on her.  I've found some good insights while digging through this earthy volume.    
 First: This sounds like the noise my friends and I used to make in our pre-teens on an old Silvertone guitar before any of us learned how to play.  Like Sleep, we were trying to sound like Black Sabbath but relied on distortion for most of the appeal.  I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing; it just really reminds me of the make-it-up-as-you-go-along thing we were doing in our basement.  Second: This is why a singer like Ozzie Osbourne or Robert Plant is worth his weight in Platinum.  Everytime a guitar riff catches my ear, my next thought is that I can't wait to hear what the vocalist did with it, how he played off of it or along with it.  With Sleep, it is understandable why the singing is sparse -- it is inevitably a disappointment.  It's a great waste of attitude.  Though I don't think the lead singer has the pipes to pull off any great vocals, it would be nice if the current crop of metal bands didn't possess such a fear of melody.   Still, I appreciate the effort.  At least there are a few brave souls out there who are still trying to rock.  Yo, yo 
 This book doesnt help, its just keywords and blank papers. I wouldn't buy it again 
 Sentimental and uninteresting.  Ethan Canin seems to think that the same kind of character is interesting over and over.  And I hear this book was a best seller--no wonder nobody reads good books anymore when this is offered as great literary fiction 
 My friend bought this set and so I was able to view it before purchasing it myself, and I WON'T be purchasing it. I had seen The Long, Long Trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies I have ever seen; one of those films where you can't believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do. We enjoy most of the I Love Lucy series, but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows; the aggrivating ones, and this film was just an overly long aggrivating I Love Lucy episode. There is funny humor and aggrivating "humor" and this was definitely the 2nd type.   Yes, it was interesting to see Lucy and Desi doing films together, but overall these films are just tolerable, and none are ones I would rewatch for enjoyment. Too Many Girls was definitely a B picture, really really bad in so many ways...poorly written script, cheap scenery; you never got the feeling they were in college, except at the football game, which seemed so similar to the football game the Marx Brothers participated in in Horse Feathers! Too much partying, singing, dancing; what was this school majoring in, theatre and opera?  It just is a really bad picture. Yes, neat to see Lucy and Desi and how they met, and see them so young together, but otherwise, a real time waster in my mind. The funniest thing on this disc was the cartoon extra!  Of the three, Forever, Darling is probably the best but again that seemed "lacking" somewhere. The color was that beautiful almost surreal 50's color that I like. The Yosemite scenery was beautiful too. But I think the angel stuff could have been much better developed; he was out of the scene too long at times. The part I liked best was Lucy imagining herself in the movie with James Mason because it was quite funny. But the camping trip was just a very predictable mishap time that was too much in the I Love Lucy mold and I was bored with it quickly.  I know die hard fans of Lucy and Desi will buy this no matter what, and that's fine. But for others, I advise you see them first...you may like them, but then you may see them for what they really are cinematically. There are lots better movies out there that I would rather buy! I Rate these 2 stars; one star to me is "torturous" to watch. These aren't THAT bad, but almost. 
 I wonder if Judith Miller's knowledge of Islam included actually learning the 99 names for God, which define the essence of God for Muslims.  If she had, I also wonder why it didn't give her reason to pause and then share the true core essence of this faith.  I also lived a number of years in the Middle East, not as a professional, but as the American daughter of a father who worked there.  I went to a local school, took public transportation, went to the markets, LEARNED ARABIC... in a nutshell, learned WHO the people are and WHAT they believe. Judith Miller's book betrays ANY knowledge of this sort.  It's easy to become blocked by the smog and dirt of Cairo and donkeys in the streets (so shocking for Americans).  She sounds like a tourist in her descriptions of the people and culture - and after so many years there.  Reminds me of so many U.S. Embassy personnel I met - shrouded by the Embassy and cultural center walls and private chauffeurs.  What a shame - she just didn't get it.  If anyone wants to learn more about the Middle East, don't limit yourself to this book - you'll be doing yourself a disservice 
 I'm almost finished with it, now. I quit at one point and started it again. I like reading lousy books by talented people. He has a tiny bit of talent. Perhaps, in the future, he will sit down and actually write a good book. But this book was lousy, though maybe 20 year old boys like it - I dunno! I did liked the character, Alice, but felt that her description lacked depth so I did not really get to know her. I felt this way about almost all of the characters - that they were thinly depicted - with the exception of Dwight. AND THERE ARE NO PEAR TREES IN MANHATTAN,DUDE 
 Check out the viewable sample of the book first!  I looked through the index and it doesn't even have an entry for lycanthrope or lycanthropy.  What kind of Werewolf Encyclopedia would omit the scientific terminology for a werewolf 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 Well my computer cabinet is 15 feet away from the monitor in the other room...I got this mainly because i wanted to reduce wiring and introduce an optical/coaxial cable to my 5.1 receiver instead of 6 audio rca cables all the way to the receiver, plus wanted to be able to control individual speaker volumes on the pc. Couldnt do that in optical or coaxial mode, no way!! This card can only do stereo mode with digital output. So I am using those analog 5.1 outputs to the receiver (atleast from the cabinet  to my desk its usb so my mission is half accomplished) but hey wait...One more shocking thing I noticed is that the volume control is in no way co-ordinated, which means that as you turn the volume each speaker is incremented/decremented unevenly!!! Takes place subtle so you dont notice it much but if youre into very low-decibel listening you will certainly pull your hair over this.  Overall an ok card if you like decent looks. If you want something cheaper, go for an audigy se instead, it does exactly the same thing at half the cost 
 You will find the Ornithologist James Bond's old employer, Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences does not sell copies of this book.  They will sell you Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book instead.  Why?  Because, it is at least from the 1930.  it contains information which is seriously dated.  Not to mention that the pictures are mostly in black and white with only about 10 colour plates.  The pictures that are contained in the volume are not very representative of the birds you will encounter.  This book is acceptable if you intend on bird watching on your caribbean holiday, but we spent much of our time guessing if we were really looking at a bird.  Yes, you can take a book of Eastern US birds with you, but do you want to take a birdwatching library with you on your holiday?  Not to mention there are birds which will not show up in a US Bird book (e.g., bananaquit and parrots).  You will notice that the most effusive reviews of this book come from fans of Ian Fleming's 007, not bird watchers.  That is because this book is much more a piece of 007 trivia than useful to modern bird watchers.  The story of How Ian Fleming's agent was named was that Fleming was at Goldeneye, his Jamaican house, and needed a name for the protagonist of his spy novel.  Fleming wanted a plain name and his eye came upon his copy of James Bond's "Birds of the West Indies", which Fleming described as his bible.  Fleming thought that James Bond would be the perfect name for his spy (No, Audobon would not have been a possibility).  Mr. Fleming paid the ornithologist a dollar a year for the privilege of using  the name James Bond in his novels.  Serious bird watchers are better served buying Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book or James Kavanagh's "Caribbean Birds".  You could also be sentimental and want this because it was what you used when you were young during the period that this version of "Birds of the West Indies" was the only show in town.  In case you haven't guessed, I am both a bird watcher and James Bond fan who owns two copies of this book.  Consider this review with that in mind 
 My mother gave us our Rival F69204 Electric White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer, which worked well for three seasons.  Yesterday, I made a batch of frozen custard for company for dinner.  The result was terribly salty and had to be thrown out.  I filled the stainless steel container with water, which seeped out overnight.  Apparently ice cream salt bled into the custard mix while the ice cream was making.  Online, I discovered (1) that Mother paid much too much for this item and (2) there seemed no way to order replacement parts--as in a new tank.  Can you help 
 Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.  Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.  For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.  This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.  I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.  That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.  
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 I was stuck with a bad copy and nothing has been done about it as of yet. 
 This book is good, but the book's content doesn't match the title. This book wasn't written for people who have never owned any piece of property. The book tells you a couple of nice loopholes and hidden fees most first time landlords will get hit hit with out the blue, but that is it! They have whole sections about owning 30 and 40 resident apartment buildings which is something 9 out of 10 people that read this book will not be doing for years. A lot of the advice that they give such as get a lawyer and someone to look at the property before you buy it is common sense. This book also doesn't go into great detail about taxes and how to set the correct rent level like I thought it would. This book is good for a general overview, but that is about it 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 Sure, the retail price for the four CDs together is $240 so $180 sounds like a good value. Except that Amazon is selling the first three CDs at $30 apiece and the fourth at $41 which only adds up to $131. Why in the world would someone pay an extra $50 just to buy all four at once?  The CDs themselves are great - no problem there. I just think someone in the Amazon marketing division went a little wonky with this pricing and no one has caught it.   Seriously - save yourself some dough. Until the price for all four CDs drops below the cost of buying them separately this is NO bargain 
 It's impossible to review or rate this book as it's not available.  Many of my devotional readings reference this book...but sadly I've not read it due to unavailibility.  What can I do to help get this back in print 
 I havent get the book yet???? back order it is been like almost 2 months 
 It reads exactly as you would expect, as an adventure based on a video game designed by Douglas Adams but penned entirely by the Minister of Silly Walks.    For me, it was disappointing.  
 This is not a good book. Its like R. Emmett Tyrrell built a book out of all the stuff he discarded as not good enough from all his other books on the Clintons. If you think this book is mostly about post-2000 Clinton, you would be wrong. Its all over the map.   A good book could be written about the Clinton's attempts over the past six years to maintain a strangle-hold on the democratic party and the strongarm tactics beyond push for Hillary Clinton along with the backlash within the party. But Tyrrell is more interested in tabloid scandal. We know what kind of guy Bill Clinton is and knowing more details about him and his women isn't anything I care about. I get the impression that the audence for that stuff are those who are morally outraged by Bill Clinton but at the same time want to hear every single detail.  R. Emmett Tyrrell made his career on the Clintons, but as a conservative writer he has shown remarkably little ability to go beyond them. Its not just his flaw though. Part of the reason the conservative movement is in such trouble is that its dominated by people who are stuck in the 1980s talking "remember when" style about Ronald Reagan and people who want to sit around talking about what those "darn clintons" are up to now.  Don't bother buying this book. Don't waste your time thinking about how terrible the clintons are. Political movements are successful when they have an agenda of ideas and when they are forward-thinking. Living in the rear-view mirrior, hating, being angry and worring what other people are up to leads inevitably to failure. 
 Typical obvious (re-)placement and (recently all too common)  Italian American as disgusting, classless, filthy villain/movie producer makes this book a real disapointment. So boring to make the Italian the new interchangeable bad white guy...tired and boring 
 I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort 
 I FELT THIS BOOK WAS GEARED TOWARDS THE  OLDER CHILD,MORE SO THAN TODDLERS.NEEDED A SECTION FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 Waited for this and expected it to be a top class production. But what a waste....I can't understand how musicians can release a DVD that sounds this bad. Seems a rushed production and more of a money spinner than a quality product 
 Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:  http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
 Like some of the other reviews, I loved cool edit pro. Then Adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2.0. I use this program often and tried to give it a chance. No way around it, it sucks now. I am going to use Sonar, a much better product. The only thing I like about 2.0 is that you can burn to a disc from Audition. That is the only reason why I gave it one star. This is not a user friendly program 
 My son received this as a birthday gift and it broke the 2nd time that he played with it. While I was putting it on him the plastic belt just snapped in half. Luckily we had a different belt from another toy that we could use with the gadgets. The previous reviewer was right about the difficulty of taking the gadgets on and off. There's no way that my 4 year old son could do it without my help. If I had the receipt I would have returned it 
 I love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and I liked 'It's goin' down' when I heard it on the radio. However, I just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'Dope boy magic.' When I heard him rap about 9/11 I was immediately turned off and enraged. How could he rap about something that tragic?! Does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records?! Hopefully not! This is disgusting! I hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'Dope boy magic' (and more than likely others too, but I didn't stick around to listen) before purchasing to see for themselves what a SOB this guy is. 
 I liked Time magazine a lot until they named George Bush person of the year? Oh my god, where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article 
 "This is how one ought to see," I kept saying as I looked down at my trousers, or glanced at the books in the shelves "This is how one ought to see, how things really are." Things without pretensions, satisfied to be merely themselves, sufficient in their Suchness. "The nearest approach to this," I said, "would be a Vermeer." Yes, a Vermeer. For that mysterious artist was trebly gifted-with the vision that perceives the Dharma-Body as "the hedge at the bottom of the garden" with the talent to render as much of that vision as the limitations of human capacity permit, and with the prudence to confine himself in his paintings to the more manageable aspects of reality; for though Vermeer represented human beings, he was always a painter of still life. The essential Not-self could be perceived very clearly in things and in living creatures on the hither side of good and evil. - Aldous Huxley, THE DOOR OF PERCEPTION  
 HE SOULD KEEP WRITING RYMES FOR OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE RBX AND THE WORK HE DOES WITH OTHERS BUT ON HIS OWN NOT SO GOO 
 This book was not what I wanted.  I was looking for a practical guide that gave examples of questions typically asked in a law enforcement interview and examples of good answers to those questions.  This book is more of a workbook that makes the reader develop his own ideas for typical interview questions and answers.  I could have done that on my own without paying over $30.    The book is also poorly written, which made me question the qualifications of the author.  The author apparently has a Ph.D., but he has not mastered the use of punctuation.  Here are a couple of examples from the book.  On page 36, he writes, "Strategies that do not produce a desirable image of you, as being genuine, or showing you as being comfortable with what you are saying; will in the end come across as artificial and scheming."  On the following page, he writes, "Why?  Because: people with specialized training should not, be given any advantage over people, without such training."  Because there were similar errors throughout the book, it was hard for me to take his advice seriously. 
   Creationists like Dembski would like to drag us back into the dark ages.  Back to times of the "inquision" when they burned the unfaithful and locked Galileo under house arrest for daring to challenge church athority with new views of the universe.  Galileo and Darwin were pioneers in modern science, not the end all.  The world is not flat and evolution is a fact.  Get used to it 
 Has a horrible "show don't tell problem", pacing problems, clichs are handled poorly and characters are rather two dimensional 
 When I first heard that 4 Strings would be coming out with another album I was excited. I had so thoroughly enjoyed their first cd that I had high hopes for this one. The first single was amazing! The day it came out I ran out and bought it. I must have listened to it hundreds of times, it was so good! I couldn't wait for the actual album. Then it came out...My excitement diminished. First of all, I realized that Vanessa was barely on the cd. You don't mess with a good thing! Vanessa's voice complimented the music so well! Then a second problem arose: the music seemed like a rehash of the previous album's music only this time with different lyrics. What happened?! The only relief I found in this cd was the track "Euphoric Eyes." It's the only track that doesn't make me want my money back. (even both versions of the title track "Turn It Around" make me angry. I advise getting the single, as it has the best version.) So here's my verdict: Major disappointment. Why, 4 Strings? Why 
 'The Only Guide To A Winning Bond Strategy' and 'The Only Guide To A Winning Investment Stragegy You'll Ever Need' make some good and invaluable points. HOWEVER, you can't help but wonder if the information contained in both the books could have been condensed to a lengthy article. The basic point of both books is that the market is efficient and it is a waste of money to buy actively traded mutual funds or to try and actively trade securities yourself. I found it more than a little irritating that the same examples and quotes were used OVER and OVER again in 'Investment Strategy', so imagine my dismay when I bought 'Bond Strategy' and discovered that a good third of the book explains the same things as 'Investment Strategy' did (e.g., Efficient Market Theory) and uses the same quotes and examples. Seriously, I could have done without the antedotes regarding Copernicus and Galileo again. Similarly, each chapter is prefaced with half a page of quotes. Remember those kids in grade school (and University!) that tried to beef up their scanty reports with long quotes, appendixes, title pages and a nice looking report cover? Unfortunately, some of that is going on here. It is really obvious the publishers and authors of these books stretched their information so that it reached 'book length'. In 'Investment Strategy' you are paying for 85 pages of appendices and indexes, and probably another 100 of quotes and antedotes. That is over half fluff and filler. Don't get me wrong. There some valid points in this book. But maybe you should just go to your local library or Borders and take notes from Chapters 7 and 8 in 'Investment Strategy' and kind of skim the rest. I don't mind paying for books, but I feel a little duped by all the fluff in these books. Good points, but low bit rate. 
 If you want to find diverse music for a situation, you'd be better advised to use the iTunes Music Store's iMix feature to find what other people reccomend. This book mostly groups songs by title, and not as much by style. Besides, its easier (and cheaper) to use the imixes on the books site www.peachpit.com/playlistbook. Don't buy this, and spend the money on music from the iTMS 
 Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred 
 The book is well written but lacks in breadth of manager case studies. So much of the book is written toward financial institution managers that it has little applicability to managerial positions in manufacturing, engineering, or other disciplines that don't involve motivating people to meet their sales quotas 
 When I ordered this product, it had a 4 star average rating  - how that happened is beyond me. Were a zero star rating available, this product wouldn't even deserve the string of uncolored stars!  I purchased it, thinking it would certainly do better than the plastic "freebie" grinder that came with some peppercorns about a year ago. After many refills, that all-plastic grinder has finially started to wear out and peppercorns get stuck in the "gears", the grinder has started to squeak and spits out chunks of pepper.   So I order this one -- it's attractive, low/mid priced and offers a warranty against wearing out -- and guess what? I'm still using the plastic worn-out grinder! This MIU grinder was a total waste of money and I just can't bear to listen to it squeal when I attempt to use it. Its adjustement is loose enough, that's not the problem.   What good's a lifetime warranty against wearing out if I'm not going to use the grinder at all?  Now I'm stuck with it, unless I want to pay to ship it back and lose free shipping discount on the original order, so basically, I may could get a few bucks back. Which is probably what I'll do because this grinder isn't worth 2 cents! I wouldn't even give the thing away.   Maybe pepper grinders are one of those things you just need to feel and buy in person. I'll certainly not purchase another one online.  If you like the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard, buy this grinder. Buy a second one for your salt while you're at it. You'll love 'em!  (Update 1 month later - I tried to give this thing a chance and the god-awful squealing is becoming less consistent. Which might be even worse, as it now takes me by surprise as it lets out a high-pitched jag every so often. It's gotten quite worse, however, with spitting out various sized chunks of peppercorn ... from fine grind to quarter-corn sized pieces in a few turns. Not recommended at all. I might try switching it over to salt, maybe it can handle that better. 
 I stumbled across this CD when I was looking for an Enya-like artist and subsequently bought this CD solely based on other reviews. What a mistake.  The vocal aren't ethereal and the instrumentals are grating.  The worst part is the extensive use of echo and reverb.  I don't know who mixed this album or who approved its use but I am sure they were stoned out of their mind at the time.  If I had to describe it, I would say it is a "punk" version of an Enya wannabe or some other untalented artist, mastered by some guy who passed out on the effects console.  I can't recommend it to anyone, unless maybe you sniff paint fumes for a living. 
 Musically dull; vaguely reminiscent of The Cure but not as good.  I was given this CD as a gift.  After listening to it, I told her she could keep it.  
 Since when have comics become a medium for projecting current topical events (drug use, puberty-induced angst, teen pregnancy)?  Morrison is a gifted writer, but its obvious that the guy is trying to kill the title. Things are complicated enough in the X-Men titles (New X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, Ultimate X-Men, Exiles, etc.), but this takes it to a new level.  Who are these people?  What do they bring to the table in terms of advancing the storyline?  Why is Xavier just sitting around and letting his students kill people? And what's with the art?  I can forgive on the condition that this is the same guy who penciled the original Aeon Flux, but thats about it 
 I do not understand why certain critics who are acquaintances of Mr. Lambert's have described this as an affectionate book about actress Natalie Wood. It is not a sympathetic portrait of Miss Wood' in fact, Mr. Lambert blames her for the tragic events in her life when she's not alive to defend herself. He also goes out of his way to attack her mother and her sister in what seems to be a personal vendetta while at the same time falsely glorifying rv actor Robert Wagner, who he admits is a long time friend of his. There would be no need to remember Miss Wood in a book at this time had she not drowned under suspicious circumstances that Mr. Wagner obviously wishes to conceal. It is clear that Mr. Lambert's true loyalty is to Robert Wagner, not to Natalie Wood 
 That part alone was not a redeeming factor for the film. I'm not going to even get into the fact that the actors performances were dull to say the least, or that the plot from beginning to end was lackluster. I actually wasted $3.99 renting this schlock on ON DEMAND. Boy, do I want my 4 bucks back. Basically, all this movie was about was five crackheads running around playing crackhead games. If I wanted to see that, I could have saved my money and walked around the corner. Furthermore, I could have got a camcorder and made a movie about a bunch of fiends sitting around the house babbling about nonsense for two hours!! Would have saved millions. To sum up, I would like to advise folks to please avoid this as if it was the Ebola virus!! 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 I'm not surprised that someone with very little exposure to philosophical thought would find the arguments of this book convincing. The authors do a great job of employing misleading statistics and frequently resort to logical fallacies (petitio principii, mainly) in their arguments. This book is great if you want an anti-capitalist screed, but it fails miserably as an impartial analysis of business ethics. Like ssaber, I was disappointed to find a three page "defense" of capitalism and a ten page attack of it in Chapter 4, "The Nature of Capitalism." The authors include the views of a wide range of notable experts in this section, including but not limited to Karl Marx, George Soros, and Bertold Brecht (yeah, now there's a real authority on the subject). Why not include Sean Penn while you're at it, guys? I wasn't surprised to find that they'd skipped over real economists like Keynes, Hayek, and Friedman. 
 This little booklet was returned.   It had pages missing and no index as advertised. 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 I can't beleve that Ritchie Blackmore- the premier guitar virtuoso of Deep Purple and Rainbow would plummet to a style that has no relationship with Rock and Roll.  This is all midevil crap that sounds like it should be in a musical or footstomp or the toilet!  If you are looking for vintage Blackmore don't buy these Blackmore's Knight recordings.  You will be disappointed, shocked, stunned and disillusioned.  [...] 
 I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism. 
 This book is more about Mo, Mo's career & american journalism, than the Presidential pets. If you are not American & not heavily into their tv journalism this book is not for you. Oh there is a small section at the end that mentions the pets 
 I can't review an item you haven't sent me yet 
 The emotional exaggeration and vitriolic attacks are so great readers will have a difficult time trusting the author's research and writing. Hanegraaff's diatribe should be ignored 
 The book "Child of Fire," by Scott O'Dell is not a book I recommend to young readers. This book deals with topics that readers who are not mature enough might not understand. For example violence and drugs  are strong topics dealt with in this book. There is also a part in the book  where the topic of abortion is mentioned. This happens when Manuel's  girlfriend Yvonne tells him she's pregnant and wants three hundred dollars  for an abortion. It ends up being a lie, she just wants Manuel's money.  Either way it is still a topic that should not be exposed to young readers  in a book,but if possible by their own parents.  The book is basically  about two young boys no older than sixteen who are both leaders in rival  gangs. These two boys, Manuel Castillo and Ernie Sierra, compete against  each other to see who is braver.Manuel's way of showing bravery is by  jumping infront of a gate when the bull charges out of the tunnel.Luckily  he does not get killed but risks his life just so people can see how  "brave" he is. Ernie Sierra is a drug dealer who exports drugs  from USA to Mexico using pigeons, like the ones used to send messages. Ben  Delaney is Manuel's parole officer, who is also the narrator of the  story.Throughout the story Delaney tries to keep Manuel out of trouble. I  guess the best human concern developed  by the author is courage. Not in  the part of the two boys because killing people and selling drugs isn't  being courages,but by the parole officer Delaney. Sometimes he had to face  danger just to try to keep the two gangs from fighting.For example when he  goes to Ernie's house to prevent Manuel from killing Ernie, he is risking  his life by being caught in the middle and getting shot. Delaney is afraid  of getting shot by Ernie, but he still tries to stop him from harming  others.  Throughout the story these two boys both commit acts that are  unappropriate for children their age. Like I stated before Ernie sells  drugs and also harms anyone that gets in his way. Manuel ends up in jail  for causing a mutiny on a ship he was working on, and ends up escaping from  jail. At the end of the story Manuel Castillo ends up getting killed by a  grape picking machine. Not by accident but by displaying what he thought  was courage or bravery. He jumped in front of the machine, (just like he  did before with the bull) and did not move when it came towards him. The  machine ended up squishing him just like if he were a grape.This story  shows young readers the wrong idea of being courages, and is therefore not  a book I recommend to young readers 
 With so many serious perspectives available on "peak oil", there is no reason to waste time on this screed, which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates (and he hates, of course, all that which he does not understand).  He hates: the American south and its culture, Wal-Mart, interstates, strip malls, the Arab nations, and most of all, suburbs and the people who live in them. He loves: Israel, the liberal Northeast as it was fifty years ago, Israel, hateful rants, and Israel.  Peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the Arab states will lose their power along with their oil, how the suburbs and Wal-Mart will collapse without cheap motoring, and the greatest reach of all: how the South and West will, for some reason, suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable. Despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil, and have the least access to alternatives: solar, wind, biofuels. This last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the American population from the dying Rust Belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south.  Of course, he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil; back then he was making the same arguments about how Y2K was going to destroy all those things he despises. As were a lot of the other peak oilers.  Everywhere Kunstler goes, he sees only ugliness. This is to be expected. The ugliness lies within him, so he will never escape it.   Give this one a wide berth and learn something about Austrian economics. You'll be glad you did 
 Absolute bore.  I understand book of such caliber probably shouldn't be literally interesting, but it's bore.  I am happy I became Christian before reading this book.  Please, understand me right, I am not against it-its just, I can't read it to the end, it is absolutely uninteresting book.  Moreover, author tries enforce his particular view of Christianity on a reader.  In a way, I feel that book of such caliber should be necessary read for a Christians who want to go to some kind of biblical school.  They may see if they are ready personally for Christian academics.  Knowing about Christ by heart and trying to learn about Him theologically and academically can be two very different things.  Everyone on Earth are ready for the heart approach, I doubt though you won't be disappointed if you choose to learn about the Way and Christ academically.  It's hard; it's not for everyone.  It may even damage your zeal for Christ.  Definitely not for me.  (Maybe I need Theology book by another author though, ha, ha. 
 I agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this item is always on back-order.  After waiting for this item for several weeks already, I was today told by Amazon that there would be an additional one-month delay.  I have canceled my order and ordered these videos directly from Infantastic 
 Angela Hewitt proves once again that the modern piano is as out of place in the world of Baroque harpsichord music as the electric guitar and moog synthesizer.   I love to hear the modern piano play modern music - I love the keyboard music of Shostakovich, Bartok, Messiaen, Berg, Webern, Berg, Scriabin and Boulez. A modern piano in the music of these composer is just right. I have a recording of the keyboard music of Debussy on a 19th century pianoforte and it is clear to me that the instrument DOES matter.   I tried to listen to this recording and I found myself instantly repelled. There is a belligerent smugness about Angela Hewitt I find most disagreeable and tedious. This isn't her repertoire and she isn't welcome here by this lover of Rameau.   Three steps forward and two steps back. Angela Hewitt, I am afraid to say, represents the backward steps. Angela Hewitt is an anachronism - a reminder of the bad old days when modern musicians smugly thought that their chosen instrument was capable of playing and appropriate for any form of music from any period or culture. Maybe Angela Hewitt should record some traditional Japanese koto music on her modern grand piano and try telling the Japanese that their instruments are inadequate and inexpressive? Playing 18th century French Baroque harpsichord music on a 21st century Grand Piano is no different, only Rameau is not here to whack her over the knuckles!   This disc is of only passing interest to pianists and piano students who are arrogant about the modern piano's appropriateness for ANY music! If you're any sort of lover of Baroque music or French Baroque music or the great music of Jean-Philippe Rameau, you'll prudently ignore and/or avoid this unnecessary disc and look elsewhere. Christophe Rousset plays the clavecin music of Rameau with great style, wit and wisdom. Look no further than his recordings. Hewitt's recording is a waste of time.  Needless to say, Angela Hewitt will probably be recording the music for virginals of William Byrd, next, and I will scrupulously avoid that recording, should it haplessly eventuate. 
 The bed warmer was described as "dual" controlled.  It comes with only one control.  The entire bed has to be at the same temperature.  The reason I wanted "dual" control was because my husband is always warm and I'm almost always cold --- hence, seperate controls were needed.  Since we had the coldest winter in years, I adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described. It does heat well though 
 The quality of the workmanship is awful! I didn't even get to use it - the top had chips in it and the bottom of the pestle had a huge crack that looks like it happened during the firing process 
 What is the point of this book? Its premise is a hoax. Paul didn't die. Sure, there was a rumor, and once started people started looking for facts to fit the bill. But, I repeat: Paul didn't die. He never even pretended to die. It wasn't a PR stunt, it isn't a proper Beatles story worth spending the time of day on -- it's just something that originated with a casual joke and gathered its own momentum. It had more to do with crackpot fans and conspiracy theories than reality. However well written a book about nothing might be, at the end of the day, it's still flimflam 
 My advice is to watch this in French, which is less painful especially if you don't speak French.  In English, its unbearable.  Slow?  At one point the DVD froze and I didn't realize it for several minutes 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 I still got the marks.  iwish it had of helped.  I used it for a while after giving birth but it didn't help. 
 I am not sure the person who wrote the chapter on Isla Mujeres is familiar with the metric system.  "1 km or 1.6 miles."  The back of the book has a conversion chart showing that 1km = .62 miles.  They make this conversion mistake all throughout this chapter 
 I loved Steel's early works.  I read them all and they were great but have stopped reading her because her books are repetitive now.  I decided to try once again just to see and this book was maddening!!  It was 178 pages long and could have been all been said in 100 pages.  It was obvious that she was stretching it to make it a hardback "novel" length to sale.  Skip it.  
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 This is a fairly short book, and can be read in one or two sittings.  It is very easy to read, and sort of enjoyable.  On the down side, this author spends too much time trying to vilify Plato and Aristotle, resorting to a very unlikely idea that they conspired to bury Parmenides' ideas, and/or make it look like Plato was his true heir, rather than Zeno.  As other reviewers of this book have pointed out, they would have had no motive to do so.  Since this book is so short and easy, what the author could have done is spend a lot more time supporting his ideas rather than just stating them as fact without convincing evidence.  Or better yet, he could have chosen to just focus on the mystical importance of Parmenides' writings and just avoid the conspiracy theory and trying to rewrite history altogether.  This is where I have the most sympathy for the author:  I believe he may indeed understand Parmenides' writing from a mystical point of view, and in some ways this is why his writing style is passionate.  For this reason I almost gave this book three stars; but I couldn't do this because this isn't the only book about the underworld initiation or "dying before you die"; and yet the author almost acts like it is or like he's discovered something nobody else has.  If passionate and mystical, the author's style could also be described as lurid.  He almost seems to act as if the discoveries are too amazing to be believed, narrating as if he's telling a children's story by continually using rhetorical questions like "And you know what they found next?".  He suggests on one hand that people of european descent who are interested in the east are neglecting their own heritage, and then claims that we are indebted to the east and there is a conspiracy trying to cover that up.  Actually, every book I've ever read on Greek Philosophy states that the Greeks took significant portions of their ideas from the east.  At one point he mentions a memorial (constructed about 500 years after Parmenides was alive) of Parmenides which gives him a title that fits with his theory, yet when he points out that the face couldn't have been Parmenides' (on a statue of Parmenides) but it was a generic face, he overlooks that.  In other words, he uses the evidence when it fits his theory, and excuses it when it doesn't.  The people who constructed the memorial could have been mistaken about his title and it's implications since it was centuries after he lived.  I think that if he focused on writing a book of mystical importance, rather than getting caught up trying to overthrow the establishment philosophers and rewrite history, he'd create something a lot better.  He seems to forget that Plato also, was a mystic, and had received the underworld initiation.  Even though universities focus mainly on Plato's secular writings, his mystical and esoteric writings are there.  I still feel like I want to read this author's other books, if for no other reason than because they are kinda fun, and to write another critique 
 This book was okay for a beginner, I suppose, but the way I see it, anyone that would be aware of and interested in astrological transits is looking for something more substantial.  Howard Sasportas' book on the transits of the outer planets, Gods of Change, is a much more useful tool, although it would be wonderful to see a full length book on Uranus 
 The one star is for the bag it comes in. You can take these things along with you...but honestly, how many of these things will you really need? Maybe just two of them, the nail clippers and the bulb syringe...I have the set, given to me as a gift. I say, just buy these things separately, it's cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you...it's more practical than buying this whole set.. 
 I'm very disappointed by the lack of content in this book. After breezing through it in one night I felt like there was so much more that can be covered. Most of the book were pictures the author has taken for portfolios he's build. The quality of pictures are ok at best. It would have been more useful if he used portraits from photographers to contrast to his own style. The reader had to take the authors word on what looks right and wrong. 1 or 2 more view points would have made a huge difference.   Specific information on important aspect of shooting the shots were also left out. The author should have gave more insight on picking locations, using the right lighting, instructing the models, and how to conceptualize the pictures. If the focus of this book was not on the technicalities of portfolio photography but rather on working with models there is still be a huge gap in information. More insight and techniques for instructing the model during the shoot or details on the financial aspect of this type of photography would have been very useful.  Reading through the book, I feel like the author thew it together based on  a few notes and added pictures from his own portfolio. As it stands, most the book can be summarized in only 10-15 pages. The content fails only to pierce the most basic of details on portfolio shooting. I would recommend readers to seek out other literature on the subject as this entire book would only cover what would be a chapter in most comprehensive books on model photography 
 I've seen a lot of movies and read a lot of reviews over the years, and I have never before found a movie that was judged so highly by well-known critics to be so poor. There is a fair amount of visual beauty, including that provided by lead actress Shu Qi. But the imagery amd music are repetitive, the camera work is slothful and uninspired, the music is largely trite and cloying, and the sparse dialogue is alternately trite and banal.  good love stories show you why and how the people love each other; these show you neither. I am a big fan of foreign films and I often like films that don't follow conventional formulas, and films paced slowly and without a lot of dialogue or action, e.g. The Silence and Cache. But without much dialogue, action, innovation, or substance, what's left is "Three Times".    
 Well, I was really prepared for something special.  Not!  This is a book for Cityfolk.  Those of us from the Heartland know how to do these things or have a pretty good idea and know where to go to learn.  There was nothing special for me 
 The item description for this book is misleading.  Even the book cover is misleading--it does NOT contain 8 complete stories.  It contains 6 complete stories and one chapter each from Homer Price and Centerburg tales... so much for all of McCloskey's previously published works 
 But had one of the  worst endings ever...what happened anyway? My husband and I had to rewind the movie 3xs and still could not decide if the two people on board were alive or ghosts?  For example, the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn't see the woman, who was clearly standing up looking around.  And her baby was crying miserably...the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet, she wasn't interested at all in comforting the child, instead, she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved, which didn't make any sort of sense?  These types of questions CHEAT the viewers, because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end...its like ordering a piece of cake, and not being allowed to eat it...which sucks!  Ohh, by the way, four out of the six actors should find new careers 
 Whoever thinks this "marriage" of opera and pop was a good idea is the same guy that thinks John Tesh is a great composer.  People have simply stopped listening seriously to music, and it is a real shame.  This recording is for the scrap heap.  The accompaniment is cheesier than a big wedge of provolone.  There isn't a single live musician in the studio with this young lady.  The people who think this is good music are the same ones that aren't bothered by the prospect of a canned sound track in a Broadway show or the "pop stylings" of Charlotte Church.  Go out and find some REAL MUSIC, people!  It's there if you look.  As the great American composer Charles Ives wrote: "Open your ears!&quot 
 Overproduced talentless "Christians" who wouldn't know a moral reality if it bit them on the rear.  If there's a soundtrack in hell, this will be it.  These clowns covering Lee Greenwood!  An amazing cultural phenomenon, a sign of the times -- sanctimony, ignorance, and extreme lack of talent.  Party on, dimwits 
 Let me admit up front- I'm a techie, and I'm a libertarian. That being said, I've always been interested in geek culture and _why_ there are more libertarians in the techie community than in the general populace. When I heard this book was coming out I really thought I'd enjoy it. I expected a book about libertarians in the technical community written by an outsider (Ms. Borsook isn't a libertarian). And I expected it to be an unbiased, thoughtful examination of this phenomenon. Boy, was I surprised. The book is one, long slam against libertarians. Ms. Borsook obviously has a bone to pick and pick it she does. She makes lots and lots and lots of unsupported statements about how libertarians are wrong about almost everything. She makes no attempt to hide her bias against the libertarian view. The book might have been better titled 'A Critical Look At Those Complete Morons Who Call Themselves Libertarians In The High Tech Community' because that's the attitude she takes. This book is the intellectual equivalent of a Bill O'Reilly or Michael Moore book- if you want to read a book slamming libertarians and don't care for well constructed arguments or even a very good book structure this is your book 
 Let me first say that I'm a huge fan of Seth Godin. That being said, this is not one of Seth's better works. A better title might have been: The Big Red Herring: A few of my web page pet peeves.  Here's how the book breaks down. There are a total of 111 pages. There are 46 mini-critiques which are comprised of one page with a single B&W screenshot of a webpage or email and a facing page explaining what you're looking at. These pages are usually only about 3 - 4 paragraphs (half the page). Of the 46 mini-critiques, 7 are about emails. This leaves 39 mini-critiques about actual websites.   I think that for the money we should have had at least a few of the screenshots in color, particularly the one where Seth tells us that the buttons are the wrong color, but doesn't mention what color they are. We don't know, we're looking at a B&W picture.  There are only about 13 unique insights. So each insight is repeated an average of 3 times. In the book Seth himself says, "Redundancy is often the enemy of a great web experience". Well, ditto for the book experience.  The first web site listed on Seth's recommended site list is [...] You'll find that the only content on the web site is directed toward selling you the book that you're already holding. There are no extra web site critiques or examples. As Seth himself would say, "Where's the banana?" 
 Back in November, I started "The Diet Cure."  I was a little overweight, had low energy and mood problems.  Thought eating healthy would help.  Oh man.  Increasing my protein intake from the little (or none) I ate to the whopping 20g a meal that she recommends (and cutting down drastically on carbs) brought on a state of ketosis that caused a constant ache in my kidneys.  On top of that, my face started flushing beet red every couple of hours.  I was miserable and teary and almost passed out on the street. So I stopped the Diet Cure after four days.  Just FOUR DAYS of it and FOUR MONTHS LATER I am still struggling to deal with the mess it has caused in my body.  My doctor says it triggered hypoglycemia, which I have to manage by eating six carefully controlled meals a day.  My kidneys seem to have bounced back, but the mystery facial flush only stopped a week ago after I tried everything I knew to deal with it. I know that it's not Julia Ross's fault that I wasn't eating any protein to begin with, but I do think her advice was highly irresponsible.  Sudden, dramatic dietary changes can mess you up irreparably.  I have heard similar stories from a number of people now.  I wish I'd heard them before I read this book.  Sudden dietary changes can give you big, nasty, lifelong diseases like colitis or hypoglycemia, just to name the ones I've personally heard about. What's sad is that the diet she recommends is actually pretty good for me.  If she had advised me to gradually ease on to it over a period of 12 months, I'd be writing a very different review. So please please please, if you're considering following this program, make the changes gradually.  If you do it fast, what happened to me may not happen to you - but why take the risk 
 I did not enjoy or understand this strange tale. Perhaps a reader's guide should accompany it. I do, however, treasure The Collected Stories Of Eudora Welty 
 Mr. Taylor has good general knowledge of detailing.  How that knowledge would translate into information for experienced professionals is not clear.  I can see an auto enthusiast gaining some good general knowledge  from this book, however, the knowledge shared is both too general and lacks  suffecient explanation.  I still haven't found a book that truly shows how  the professional detailers make a car into a work of art.  Maybe this book  comes close, but I was hoping for some honest to goodness tricks and  insider techniques 
 boy, you 5 star reviewers make me laugh. why don't you go pick up a copy of "full collapse" to see first hand how this band totally ripped-off thursday ala "loose lips sink ships". The guitar riffs, melody, atmosphere, timing and structure are EXACTLY the same as thursday's "cross out the eyes". it takes no talent to take someone elses idea, redo it, and call it your own. the biggest poser band of all time, "a change of pace" makes limp bizkit look cool and original. what a bunch of turds 
 I bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new Fodor's isn't out yet. This has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations, but isn't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins. the maps are not comprehensive enough (the one for modern jerusalem  didn't cover a third of the city, and the one for tel aviv was tiny), and there is not enough practical information about food, hotels, and getting from place to place. I was disappointed. 
 Katz's "Dogs of Bedlam Farm" is a litany of Katz's inadequacies as a man and as a dog trainer.  Katz doesn't love dogs (he admits that he dislikes going to places where dogs and people interact, like dog shows, agility or herding trials), he loves HIS dogs.  He loves them so much that he buys them a farm in upstate NY and stocks it with 16 sheep.  Sheep which he constantly whines about having to care for during a bitter NY winter.  He just has to have 16 sheep, five wouldn't be enough apparently, even though they'd be much easier to care for than 16.  Dogs which he loves so much that he lives apart from his wife.  A wife that he SAYS he loves - but apparently not as much as HIS dogs.  If you're getting the idea that I believe that Katz loves his dogs as possessions, you'd be correct.  And, of course, as a source of income as he writes books about them.  And although Katz fails to train two out of three of his Border Collies, so much so, in fact, that he has to give one of his beloved failures away because he thinks he treats the dog as his father treated him. After two failures and although the third dog pretty much trains herself, Katz glories in being known as the local "dog man". As someone who has owned, trained and exhibited dogs for over 50 years, I see little to recommend in this book.   
 I feel really sorry for the student assistants that got credit in the front of Dobb's book for their careful editing.  This book has more typos in it than any thing I have ever seen.  And if Torts law was not hard enough to understand, having to work within Dobbs sorry typos makes it that  much harder.  Content wise, the book just does not lay out Torts in any  logical order.  It is just too hard from this book to pull out what the  rule is and whether a case represents the majority view or a minority.   Defense arguments against recovery tend to get far less coverage than the  plaintiff viewpoint: That much is obvious from the books' subtitle.   Overall, it is required that you use a study supplement with this book.  I  recommend "Understanding Torts" by Larry Levine, et al.  Don't  buy this book unless some sadistic professor is forcing you too 
 Yet another ridiculous dog worshiping book. It suggests that "humans" should become more like "canines". I don't see how having unprotected intercourse in public, sniffing rears, licking one's private parts, chasing cars, and rolling in manure is a good, productive, moral outlook on life.  Dogs bite approx. five million people a year in the United States, mainly children, innocent joggers and mailmen. I guess the dogs bit them first and growled later. This is a book that preaches to the choir: a choir of brainwashed dog freaks who can't see how foolish they are. Take it from an outside eye, an eye that isn't part of the dog worshiping fad: This book is stupid. If you want to pattern your life on a lower species, small-brained, subservient, man-made domesticated animal, may I suggest a good shrink?    
 The actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking. The story is too unbelievable too. It was a waste of my money to buy it. 
 The people of Awdaghast were berbers, but they were not "white-skinned". They were light brown and likely ranged from yellow in color to black, like most other Northern Africans today who live between the northernmost edge of Africa and the Sahel. Thoughout all known history, this region has been a mix of the peoples who frequently migrate across it. To label this city in particular as "white", as if some barrier existed between it and the black cities around it, is ridiculous. This is especially true, considering that the city was founded by blacks (soninke) and was abandoned as the people (everyone - berber and non-berber) moved further south to more fertile lands 
 This movie is not very realistic.  The sets are great!, but the story is a Biblical SNAFU!  They had the chance to embellish the real story, without compromizing the Bible's account, but chose instead to incorporate incidents that were thousands of years later, which impeached any incredibility it might have had. I didn't like it much for that reason.  
 Unfortunately, I can't give this book - "Zero" or Negative Stars, that is the only reason I would give it 1 Star.  For real mystery lovers, think of the mystery equivalent to "Plan 9 From Outer Space". I listened to this on CD with my wife, and literally had trouble staying awake.  On the CD version, I don't remember anything about the "entertainer" storyline, did they include that on CD?  The whole story is about "FBI agent" Ruth who goes seeking Confederate gold in a cave, bumps her head, and someone is killed in a small town.  Yep that's it - the whole story.  The story line goes from dull to disjointed to ridiculous to eventually outright knee-slapping parody.  It is as though someone was doing a "Mystery Story" for Mad magazine or Saturday Night Live skit - except that the author didn't intend for us to laugh at her story.  The ending is so totally improbable and contrived that I laughed out loud at how absolutely absurd it was.  Perhaps Catherine Coulter could try comedy instead of mysteries 
 This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention 
 Admittedly, there aren't many books devoted to the LA river so we have to make do with what's available.  Unfortunately, if you're looking for an in-depth historical biography, this certainly isn't it.  Entertaining, maybe -- a big maybe.  The text is so lightweight and airy, I half expected it to drift away.  The Blake Gumprecht book is more thoroughly researched and thought out, and a much better choice 
 I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
 Brainstorm is a great movie, but I wouldn't know that from the viewing I just had.  The quality of this DVD is absolutely terrible.  We spent the entire movie adjusting for extremes in brightness and contrast and still could not view some segments of the movie at all--the screen was completely black in some parts.  You'd be better off buying or renting a VHS copy 
 This novel tries to be funny, but the satire falls flat and the whole thing quickly becomes totally tedious. I bailed after 75 pages 
 This book was awful.  I read "The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program" (DesMaisons) first, and I was spoiled by more rational, documented approach to the subject.  To be fair, I only got through the first part of this book before I put it down in disgust.  This book is the rantings of someone who feels passionately about something.  Great.  Now back it up.  You can't just  say, "This is bad and you have to do this!"  Well... I suppose you can.  But in my opinion that makes for a lousy book for someone who is trying to learn and separate fact from hysteria 
 This is a nothing book, I mean literally, this book contains NOTHING.  No story.   No plot.   No ending.  INCEST?.....there is none, there are not even any people in it 
 Seriously, this CD is BAD.  The only song that I can say is any good is Ruben Studdard's rendition of Superstar.  And if you like that song, go buy Ruben's album, because this is not worth your money.  The only reason I can see anyone buying this album, is if you are just into collecting AI merch.  Other than than, SKIP THIS ONE 
 I found this book to be difficult to follow due to lack of examples and meandering subject matter.  The author seems to have problems focusing directly on the topic at hand.  What examples do exist have errors, which is enough to confuse any student.  The difficulty of the end of chapter problems is a bit tough at points which is confounded by the lack of provided solutions.   the book has 0 solutions with a promise that 20% of the problems are solved online.  Instead, what is found on line are hand scribbled answers with no explination.  This book is a work in progress at best 
 Ok. I am sure the majority of you are more Jamie Oliver fans than wanting to buy his book for the cooking. I really liked watching Jamie in the Naked Chef days...early ones especially so I was given this book from a friend of mine as a pressie. It was very entertaining and I guess his passion just shines through in his books and Naked chef etc... however as lame as it may sound I only recently made a couple of recipes including the 'kinda portuguese custard pie' which I know should taste amazing. I bought the best quality ingredients and even 2 vanilla pods from Sainsburys which cost me 3.99. The custard was way undersweet. Jamie suggested a medium heat to cook the custard and I even put it slightly less because my dad is a head chef and he told me it would turn into scrambled egg consistency and it did. He also said to cut the pastry 1 inch thick and I had a feeling that this would be too thin and indeed it was. I had spent one whole hour just sorting out the pastry only to end up watching it fall to pieces in the oven cos it was melting....I could go on forever but Jamie might be a good cook but do not confuse this with Gordon Ramsey standard of cooking. 
 This book is far from believable. But never the less a good read. I was able to put it down and took a few days to read it, instead of my normal one to two days. She starts plot lines and does not follow through on them. And the flow of time from chapter to chapter is very erratic.   The first chapter of this book is very well written. There is a wonderful depiction of village life in tribal India. I felt as if I was there. It makes you want to read the rest of the book.  But this level of writing is not carried through. I also found that the quick glimpse of high tech computer firms corporate backstabbing was very accurate. And the choices they make on whom to fire and keep was right on target. It made me remember why I retired from the work force before I was at the age of forty without any regret and never looked back.  The book does have romance and intrigue. But, the characters are too atypical and our heroine is too perfect. The author does try to let us into the view of a bicultural heritage in today's world. She just seemed to not know how to show is the journey. 
 Perhaps the most absurd horror film, next to Cabin fever, I have ever had the misfortune of viewing. From a technical point of view this film was terrible and amateur at best. For example in many scenes the lighting was too dark and shadowy. The acting was futile and the script was clearly written by a person who couldn't sell a novel for free. This bad script was topped off with some really poor sound editing which certainly didn't contribute to this already lousy movie. The entire movie was abound with horror cliches which made the movie very dull and easy to figure out what would happen next. There is no suspense in this trashy movie other then the fact that the viewer is wondering how much worse this movie could get. Much more if you continue down this dead end road folks! The death scenes are not worth mentioning to be quite honest. The premise of this movie is entirely laughable and inexcusable .  This was not a scary movie at all and at times I questioned whether this movie belonged in the comedy section, or in a video store at all. Please do not bother with this movie because you will  have lost about an hour and a half of your time that could have been better spent doing something worth-while. The other reviewers who gave this movie such high ratings are either lying or have this movie confused with another 
 this cd was a total disappointment  laura pausini falls into the category of "screamer": she strains her voice. it is not pleasant to hear her sing. I would save the money and spend it on something els 
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.   While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.   He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them. 
 The author missed the point of a quiet life which is that you just do it and enjoy it --- you don't call your friends to do it with you and stop when they cancel.  Another reviewer of Bender's work said that she in "in her head too much" and I completely agree. Stop thinking SO much - just enjoy life - your family. Stop making lists. Stop degrading yourself for the simple process of taking care of yourself, your family and your house. 
 I was disappointed.  If you are a skeptic who needs to be convinced to invest in silver, including history lessons, this is the book for you.  If you want to see specific examples of transactions, the Author's words in the Acknowledgements:  "On that note, I challenge the reader to look beyond this book and gather information to satisify yourself as to the true nature of money, precious metals, the financial system and your position as being one of the knowledgeable or not." Perhaps the Author's touted $60 for 6 months trial subscription to "The Morgan Report" will provide the answers.  But not for me.  I certainly agree to look elsewhere.  
 Most of Koontz's books carry you right along to the end and are enjoyable, but some derail and go in directions that are not as interesting as others.  I found this book to be that way and despite the 4 star review, was rather bored with it once it got away from Ironheart's rescues.  I'd recommend skipping this one 
 This is not Muddy at his best. Another attempt to change his sound. In spite of the efforts of a couple of members of The Band, it comes across as a weak effort. I can't believe it won a grammy. The upside is Johnny Winter and "hard again" were just around the corner! Avoid this. You won't play it much if you do own it 
 It's rather amazing how many five star "reviewers" have so much of the same bad information to impart about John Kerry, but so little to say about the substance of this book.   Rather than recycle chatroom effluvia, I will actually review the book:   Poorly researched, poorly written. Nasty, vindictive, and dishonest from start to finish.   For example, in describing his 1971 debate with Kerry on the Dick Cavett show, John O'Neill not only misrepresents what Kerry and Cavett said, and the audience's response, he actually misquotes HIMSELF. As the transcript (and video) of the debate is posted at O'Neill's own website, how hard would it have been to check for basic accuracy?   And why tell such easily proven lies, like claiming Kerry was booed during the debate, when the video clearly shows that he wasn't?   If you watch, you will also see O'Neill repeat a stunning lie about his own military service - his claim to have served "almost three years" in Vietnam. He made this claim several times in 1971, both in speeches and in writing. But his records show that he served no more than a total of 15 MONTHS in Vietnam, and that included his time offshore on a minesweeper. (You can see his military records yourself, linked through his profile at Wikipedia.)   More examples of lies and misrepresentations in the book? How about the part where O'Neill claims that Kerry filmed interviews of himself while in Vietnam - four years before those cameras had sound capability.   In a more egregious example, O'Neill posits, in Chapter 5 of UFC, that George Elliott wrote a Silver Star citation that did not reflect what happened that day. He is not honest enough to use the actual citation written by Elliott, but instead uses a later, edited version and then quotes things - like "numerically superior force" - that Elliott NEVER WROTE. The original citation written by Elliott PRECISELY reflects what happened that day - things he claims he was never told - as do the after action report and Zumwalt's monthly summary. (All of which can be found at SBVT's own archives.)   In this connection, O'Neill claims that Elliott had no idea there were troops on the boats that day (even though he was division commander) and that they conducted the first sweep - although Elliott's citation, the after action report, and the monthly summary SPECIFICALLY state that there were troops on the boats and that the troops conducted the first sweep. He also claims that "[t]here is no indication that Kerry ever reported that the Viet Cong was wounded and fleeing when dispatched" - but Elliott 's citation and the after action report SPECIFICALLY state that Kerry shot a fleeing VC, and the after action report says that the man was wounded.   In addition, O'Neill claims that Hoffmann and Elliott had been told Kerry had "almost single-handedly" taken out a bunker of VC - except NOTHING OF THE SORT appears in the original citation, the after action report, the monthly summary, or the news release for the incident. In fact, the after action report specifically says that "other units saturated [the] area with fire and beached placing assault parties ashore" while Kerry chased the VC. And of course Elliott made it quite clear in William Rood's Bronze Star citation that he didn't think anyone did anything "almost single-handedly" that day.   Again, O'Neill writes with regard to the first action, that "most, if not all, of the non-PCF troops received no medals for this action." (No kidding, he actually writes like that.) C'mon John, it is public information that the only American "non-PCF troops" there that day were the three Army advisors and the three UDT guys -  and all were awarded medals, including two Bronze Stars for the Army advisors.   And consider this. O'Neill sneers that Kerry deserved no more than a commendation medal for his actions that day. That means that none of the half dozen or so Navy officers and crew who earned Bronze Stars - for doing no more than Kerry did - deserved their medals either. No wonder William Rood wrote in disgust, "[T]his is hurting crewmen who are not public figures and who deserved to be honored for what they did. ... While they mean to hurt Kerry, what they're saying impugns others who are not in the public eye."   By the way, despite O'Neill's repeated claims to Ted Koppel and others, the eyewitnesses to the second sweep - including the only member of SBVT who was actually there - have consistently stated that there was substantial enemy fire from multiple VC at the scene. Just look inside those books you were waving at the camera, John. Or better yet, ask SBVT member Larry Clayton Lee, who believes that Kerry earned his medal that day, and whose eyewitness account contradicts just about everything you've said on the matter.   In fact, there is not a single person who was there that day who disputes what happened, or Kerry's medal. Again, as William Rood writes, "It's gotten harder and harder for those of us who were there to listen to accounts we know to be untrue, especially when they come from people who were not there."   And contrary to O'Neill's claim that the Silver Star was awarded after only two days, "with no review," the record shows it was awarded after six days, and in 1996 Elliott and Lonsdale themselves insisted that all proper review procedures were followed (as did the Navy inspector general, in 2004).   Not such great research, Johnny boy.   Though maybe we should blame some of this on Jerry Corsi. When Corsi's bigotry was revealed in some of his freeper postings, O'Neill promptly claimed that Corsi was not really the coauthor, but that he acted "simply as an editor." Now that's interesting, because aside from the fact that the narrative voice sometimes bounces between first person and third person in the same sentence, and that Corsi continues to brag about coauthoring the book, good parts of Chapters 6 through 9 (at least) are virtually lifted from his screeds at anti-Kerry sites.   Just a little short in the truth department, are we John?   While we're at it, let's ask Mr. Corsi why he REMOVED the picture of Robert McNamara's 1995 meeting with Gen. Giap, which hangs near Kerry's picture in the War Remnants Museum, from his webpage "documenting" the existence of the Kerry picture.   You see, John and Jerry show their readers pictures of other walls in the room from every possible angle (and even throw in a picture of Jane Fonda from a building across town), but conveniently "forget" to show you the most important wall of all...the wall upon which Kerry's picture is displayed. Hmmm, is it because Kerry's picture was displayed along with those of other visiting dignitaries such as McNamara, Warren Christopher, and yes, even ELMO ZUMWALT? New York Sun reporter Josh Gerstein says so ... run a browser search for his August 2004 article exposing this particular bit of sleaze.   Of course it is well known how many other claims in this book have been thoroughly debunked by overwhelming eyewitness testimony, Navy investigators, Navy documents, and in fact some of the accusers' own documents. (Tom Wright didn't patrol with Kerry after he "complained" about him? Not true, according to the command history. George Bates is "haunted" by the slaughter of village livestock? His own crewman claims responsibility for that.  William Franke's "recollections" of Kerry?  He wasn't there at the time. And O'Neill might want to get someone a little more competent to analyze those designator numbers on the March 13 spot report.)   For more point by point rebuttals of the lies contained in this book, go to Eric Rasmussen's most excellent online review, "Truth and Unfit for Command."   John O'Neill has repeatedly lied about his own service in Vietnam. In addition, he has been threatened with court sanctions for his venomous personal style, and passed over for a judgeship. Coming from the man who seconded Richard Nixon's nomination at the '72 convention, why is none of this surprising 
 "Looker" is a very stylish film and was always one of my favorite Michael Crighton efforts (even better than "Westworld") and I would have rated it a solid 4 stars if it weren't for this *terrible* transfer job they did on it.  The problem is not with clarity, color or sound -- it's with the film gate.  They must have used the absolute worst machine in the world, because the image constantly moves even during static scenes.  If you watch this on a small (26" or smaller) set it may not bother you, but anything larger will drive you crazy, I can assure you.  Which is a terrible shame, because this little sleeper of a film (it went almost unnoticed when released) is worth seeing.  It contains one of Crighton's favorite themes -- tech misused or gone out of control -- and has the great Albert Finney giving a rare performance as an adventure hero.    My advice -- definitely don't buy this film.  Rent it from Netflix and give it a watch, particularly if you don't have a nice big screen TV.  Perhaps if and when this is released on high def they'll do a much better job (and then it would indeed be worth a buy) 
 The band that holds the foot came loose with the whole string after two minutes of light use, I didn't even had the chance to kick with it; I excepted better quality from Everlast; too bad In addition, the bands that hold the chin are designed such that it is difficult to tighten this thing on your shin 
 Chapter two is worth reading, and so is chapter three.  The rest of the book is unintelligble.  Capra's cultural and historical analysis and argument are logically inconsistent with "the new physics."  Furthermore, Capra offers no treatment of Chinese civilization and culture aside from exploiting pop Chinese mystical terms.  Most of the book is a grand exercise in equivocation.  I'm sorry to run contrary to so many other readers, but my opinion is that this book will not be remembered well--if at all 
 I have read nearly every book written about the Mafia, both good and bad.  Let me say this: Bill Bonanno's book goes beyond bad.  It's absolutely awful.  The title itself, "Bound by Honor", is soaked in irony.  Where is the honor in breaking the law, going to prison, living a lifestyle that includes trampling on the rights and lifestyles of other people?    My own father truly was a Man of Honor.  He got up everyday and went to work and made an honest living.  He may not have gotten rich, but he never served a day in prison or lied to save his own skin.  But Bonanno has done both.  Where is the honor in that?  As I read one of the book's passages about a gunfight that Bonnano was in, it struck me that his vision of that shootout was rooted more in stupidity than in danger.    While Mafia books do interest me, the lifestyle itself disgusts me and makes me glad that I live a clean life.    My biggest regret concerning Bonanno's book is that I spent money on it- even if it was on sale.  It was a waste of money written by a blowhard who wasted a college education and probably put a good wife through hell.  Some Man of Honor, that Bill Bonanno.  So the bottom line is this: don't waste your money. His story isn't worth reading, he isn't worth respecting, and there isn't one scintilla of honor to be found in the activities of his family 
 Wretched little ditties by Cutesy-Pie Paulie, puffed up by a competent arranger into a bloated mess.   McCartney may be the most overrated musician of all time 
 Like the previous reviewer I studied this book in detail, took all the exams which totaled over 1000 questions, scoring over 90% on each exam and still flunked the Broker's Exam. This after having passed the State Bar exam for attorneys on the first try. This book did not cover even 10% of what was on the exam. I emailed the authors and they never responded. This book is a complete piece of garbage. You cannot count on it for anything 
 Most physicists I know say that while this is not the best of textbooks, it's a great reference.  I sometimes ask them to refer me to a useful section.  They usually can't.  This book is the standard in graduate math courses for physicists.  It's a shame.  We buy this book for the course and then either seek out other texts (or the internet) for elaboration, or more often, we trudge through all the math that Arfken leaves out.  I've rarely used any math not found in this book, but also rarely has this book been useful enough to show me how to use the math.  It's sort of like a dictionary.  Everything is mentioned, but if you want to learn about something, you need to know a lot more than just a definition.  Boaz's undergraduate math book is a good text for this subject.  Unfortunately, it doesn't go in depth enough for all of a graduate course.  For the same price as Arfken, I own about a dozen Dover editions, one for each of the important sections covered in a year long course.  A topic that we thoroughly exhausted but is not taught too often these days is complex analysis and the calculus of residues.  Residues were much more important for solving complicated integrals before computers became so commonplace.  For this, I recommend "Complex Analysis" by Tristan Needham.  It's a tome of all things complex, but if you have the time, or are just curious, it's a great book.  If possible, get a list of alternative sources from you professor before you take the class requiring this book.  Then buy them, do not buy this awful monstrosity. 
 This book and it's author's logic is flawed beyond belief !  The fact that some Historians might differ on what exactly took place inside a concentration camp is not the same thing as "denying" there was such a thing as a concentration camp. Well, it is the same thing in the mind of this author !  Asking for proof and evidence for some of the wild claims as to what actually  happened constitutes "Holocaust Denial" - in the mind of this author !  Dicussing what phisically could have happened based upon the exact science of modern forensic technology constitutes "Holocaust Denial" - in the mind of this author !  However, she goes even beyond illogic, and into the world of "make believe" with her wild claims when it comes to noted British Historian David Irving - whome she rashly bashes and libels as a "Holocaust Denier".  The problem with that reckless defamation is that David Irving has NEVER, EVER, written ANYTHING on the "Holocaust" in any of his many books on World War Two subjects.  This deliberate misrepresentation alone should consign this book to the trash heap - which sentiment a great number of others agree with considering how many are offered on Amazon Marketplace starting as low as four bucks.  For a much better look at the real meaning of the "Holocaust" in modern times, read THE HOLOCAUST INDUSTRY by Norman Finkelstein, a truly righteous Jew whose parents were both incarcerated in concentration camps in World War Two 
 This book actually has an ok story, but Rice gets way too caught up with descriptions of every minor event in it.  The history of the family was written like a real history, which may sound interesting, but in reality is just plain annoying.  After wading through 250 agonizingly slow pages I did something I've never done before; I skipped to the end.  And I'm a person who has read Stephen King's longest books in one sitting.  If you like Anne Rice dont read this, it'll just upset you.  
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 Ordered all 3 Alton Brown books.  The cooking and baking books are loaded with info for curious cooks and bakers.  The kitchen manual you could do without and your money could be better spent buying a good 3 ring binder and some good paper for making notes and writing down recipes 
 This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.  I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook 
 If you are looking for a book to read about poker, pass on this one unless you are desperate for any poker read.  Do so for a very simple reason:  there is surprisingly little about poker in this 'poker book'.    There is a detailed account of Ted Binion's murder which courses through the book.  In fact there is much more about Binion than about poker.  But this book was not found in the mystery section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Or you might like some insight about going to a jewelry store to pick out an anniversary ring for your wife.  This is covered in more detail than McManus' coverage of his WSOP satellite tournaments.  In fact, the author's wife Jennifer's ring size is six, a fact which for some reason I can't get out of my head.  But the book was not in the weddings/anniversaries section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Are you curious about McManus' childhood, his parents and grandparents?  Then this is the book for you, although it would usually be found in the autobiography section.  There is even a fascinating, endless chapter on whether A. Alvarez should have had intercourse with Sylvia Plath, and whether such coitus would have interrupted her eventual suicide (our  author thinks not, but we all know it depends).  But this book was not in the self-help-for-sick-poets section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  In all seriousness, I could go on and on with examples such as these.  It's not a bad book; in fact the sections on poker are really quite good.  If the author had edited out three quarters of the book, I would give it five stars.  When I go to the poker section of the bookstore and buy a book about poker, I want my goddess poker to be the topic.    If you're looking for one person's experience with poker, mostly but not exclusively in Vegas, read Anthony Holden's "Big Deal".  It's a great read, and it's even about poker.   
 I ordered this book after reading an excerpt from it somewhere else on-line.  I was interested in what she had to say about other women who were struggling with the work vs. family dilemma, as well as those who weren't "perfect PTA moms" who were perpetually happy.  I think perhaps the reason I found the book unsatisfying is that she tackles too many subjects in the book -- looking at women's life choices beginning in their twenties and going to retirement and beyond.  In many cases, she would introduce a subject whom she had interviewed, and a few pages later, would move on to someone else.  I found myself wanting MORE.    I also felt that, though the book is only 6 years old, it already feels dated.  She speaks about women who choose to be single parents as being in the vanguard of a new generation.  I think this may be less true nowadays, especially in the upper middle class world she describes.  She also talks about the 'betrayal' women feel who delay childbearing and then find out, too late, that they've left it for too long.  This also seems to be a nonissue these days, since the 'donor eggs' which she speaks about as a last resort, are perhaps more accepted these days as well.    That said, I would probably recommend this book to a younger woman, such as one in her twenties, just because it helps break down the idea that women's choices are black and white (work vs. family, marriage vs. career).  She shows that many people have many different paths, careers and even marriages in their lifetimes and that nothing is absolute.    
 This is the absolute worst solutions manual ever written!  There are way too many skipped problems.  The solutions that actually are given do not help the reader to understand the material at all.  Advice: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! 
 the complaints about this dvd release are all correct. great movie, low qaulity release. yet i'm surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most, the self censorship. the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer. we're ok to witness a pirate being drunk, but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate?  what are the execs at disney thinking? if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such "questionable" material as they did with many of the vault collection... fine, but stop chopping up the movies. our ten year old children are not buying these movies, many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we're being ripped off. stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance. keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title 
 I got this as a present for my fiance,thinking it would be a cute funny gift during our pregnancy.However,it got here and neither of us were amused.It's a HORRIBLE book 
 Similarities: The cover looks exactly the same, the main character goes by "Lang" (Lang Reilly - Robert Langdon!!), it takes place all over Europe, the storyline also has to do with the Knights Templar, people die, etc. (Seems as if the author doesn't have very many original ideas...)  Differences: The main charachter is not likeable, many many spelling mistakes (??), the last page is uneccesary (in my opinion), and it seemed like important parts didn't get the attention to detail that they deserved.  I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it held my interest enough for me to finish it, but it's not something I would read again 
 I have been reading Jodi Picoult's books since I first came across The Pact at the library.  And from there I glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as Songs of the Humpback Whale and then her books, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, Perfect Match and Plain Truth.  Unfortunately in recent years I haven't been able to get into some of her titles, specifically Vanishing Acts and My Sister's Keeper.  The latter title was just too sad for me to finish.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I picked up the CD of The Tenth Circle while at the library. Because I was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form, I was concerned that I might be missing something although other readers said I wouldn't be missing much.  But at this point I must add that while the reader did a fine job and I was initially intrigued with the plot and characters, this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me.  I won't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this, rather offer, instead my  views just as I finished this title.  I just finished listening to The Tenth Circle and found it was such a grim book.  Not that Jodi Picoult's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said, "There ought to be a moratorium on grief."  Unbelievable the imagination some writers have.  Maybe that's why they're writers and I'm not.  But there were some unanswered questions, coincidence, sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly.  And I might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book I enjoyed.  But I do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but I just found it overall very disappointing. I do hope I'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but I used to love this author's books and wonder if I'll continue to read her which makes me sad. 
 What a waste of money.  This book wouldn't even make a good short story.  It's a bunch of random thoughts, put together in a sort of stor 
 look, the secret to law school is finding the 1 hornbook you need to survive your class. this is not it. (sorry harvard.)  this is poorly written. most indications seem to be that gilbert's is much better. for what it's worth, the other things you need are: chirelstein for contracts; glannon for civ pro; there's nothing for torts, but i suppose glannon for torts is better than the rest; chemerinsky for conlaw; i don't know if there's one for criminal, but I used gilberts. this is poorly written and poorly explained. I've heard that gilbert's is better 
 With all the so called "talent" involved in this Masters of Horror series you'd think the stories would be scarey?  Well, they are not.  Maybe the "Masters" should go back to film school instead of feeding off each others ego's and get their "Associates" degree first 
 Overall, most recipes in this book are pretty run-of-the-mill.  Like an earlier reviewer, I have only been surprised by how unremarkable the cookies are.  Finally, I have had the experience with a number of recipes that cooking times and proportions are significantly wrong.  I wrote this after one recipe for icing turned out to be a soupy mess, and the sugar cookie dough I had chilling in the fridge was unformable.  Go with a different source for cookie recipes 
 There isn't a fact or bit of advice in this poorly written book that you can't easily find and read on the Net for free. Written by yet another patient that thinks she can write and has something to say 
 This is a good book with lots of great information about the incestuous relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family.  The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.     Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book.  Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney?  Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.  Why then did he resort to a bigot like Michael Moore for an endorsement 
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 This Product is not so good because it only plays happy Birthday. I have tried it 
  I've often said I think I was born in the wrong time.  I love the Big Band era. The clothes, the cars, the styles, and of course, the music. So let me preface by saying, maybe I'm spoiled. I have the Ken Burns Jazz documentary on DVD, along with the complete CD music collection, with most of the "individual" CDs in the series.  I own a respectable collection of Big Band music, CD's and vinyl. And I have a weekly Big Band Radio Show every Saturday morning, "Moonlight Memories". I even have the movies "The Benny Goodman Story", and "The Glenn Miller Story" on DVD.   I always look forward to reading about the Big Bands, the leaders, and the era.   But with this book I should've looked backward.  It reminds me of a 7th grade book report.  Written with huge type, wide margins, three page chapters, and plenty of spelling errors. (It isn't Paul Whitman, it's Paul Whiteman) But worse, the level of writing is only at about a Jr. High level.  I was VERY disappointed. If you are really trying to learn about the Big Band era, or even just want a "casual" read about your favorite bands, pass this by.  $19.95?! This book is $2.95 at a bargain/used book store at best. I'm sorry Bob Wilder. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... won't happen. 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 its the same old boring and unfunny jokes it always was. in my opinion it wasn't funny at all. i'm gonna get crap for it but i just thought it was stupid. larry the cable guy is the worst comedian ever. same goes for bill. the only one on the tour that wasn't over rated was ron. ron white owns. so yeah i gave it 2 stars for ron. but this totally not worth the money 
 This book is mostly fluff about what to expect at the doctors and how to react to the questions and concerns of your doctor.  The test in the beginning of the book talks about various things you should do and not do when going to the hospital.  One of the answers is that you should remove your nail polish, another refers to your husband, instead of spouse.  Dr. Roiszen is obviously preaching to only the female segment of the patient market.  He also mistakenly implies that drug salespersons, known in the trade as "detail" salesman, only give him a little token gift and states that they provide a service which he compares to the neighborhood pharmacist.  Buy the book of its information, but read it with an open mind. 
 Disappointingly, this uneven collection focuses on relatively marginal writers (e.g, Minette Walters instead of Elizabeth Peters), and has odd emphases.  Does the reader really care in each essay about the religious convictions, real or speculated upon, of every single author?  Charlotte Macleod is noted only as a biographer, and other ignored authors are Sharyn McCrumb, Mary Stewart, Jane Haddam, Dell Shannon...oh, the list is endless 
 Here's a sampling from "The Iron Dragon's Daughter"  "Behind the bar was an enormous glass tank, lit by harsh fluorescents, where the rest of the club was bathed in red and purple. A horse was drowning in the tank. Legs churning up clouds of bubbles. Eyes bloodshot and wild, it craned it's neck to lift agonized nostrils above the thrashing surface. The music was slow and romantic, but just loud enough that the horse struggled in silence."  That is obscene. It made me physically ill to where I was sweating and sick my stomach. And we wonder why violence and abuse are becoming excepted/excusable behaviors. This sort of stuff, imo, doesn't help.  Swanwick ought to be ashamed of himself for even having such thoughts let alone putting them in a book where 70% of its readers will be kids.  What's a kid, or anyone for that matter, suppose to make of that bar w/ drowning horse scene? What's MS trying to say? That hey! slowly KILLING an innocent creature is COOL entertainment. All it said to me was just how much of a sick SOB Swanwick is.  Everybody in this book uses the "F" word along with every other foul word you can think of, copiously. The higher the page# the higher the "F" count.  I don't care what you're trying to do with a story, foul language will destroy, not enhance it. Just like in real life, foul language demeans and destroys. That's what it's all about.   In class one day Jane's teacher ("fat old Grunt") "Thrust his hand between her legs and snatched up at her crotch. The class convulsed with mirth, all of them braying, snorting, snickering, laughing as if they had never seen him pull this joke before."   Huh?    This is the rudest, crudest, foulest sci/fi fantasy book I've ever read.  AND to top it all off .. THERE IS NO STORY!  There is no rhyme nor reason.   Whether Swanwick likes it or not, as an author of mostly kid read books he has, imo, some moral and social responsibility. He dropped the ball here.  I've never given censorship a thought until this book.  But I'm asking my library to pull it off our shelves. I admit, I don't want anyone, especially kids, to read this book. It's pure ugly evil. It shats on you. It's an insult to your intelligence.   Of course Swanwick is laughing all the way to the bank.

 AIkman wrote a fair history of of Christianity in China, however he misrepresents what is going on in China today.  By far the biggest problem in the Chinese church is poor teaching and abusive practices.  This exists almost exclusively in the underground churches.  Aikman wrote a book that caters to the palates of American Christian evangelicals who want to hear exactly what Aikman is telling them.  Young "missionaries" who have yet to understand the difference between culture and faith or have even critical thinking will use this book to find inspiration and funding.   As a Mandarin speaking Christian who has spent considerable time in China I was hoping to like this book. If I was not, I would proabably think it was very good 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 My 1 1/2 yr old laughs but I don't think it's bc the airplane is inside the airport. This RS I would not buy along w/ the bedtime stories one.  The ULTIMATE RICHARD SCARRY is the Splish Splash Sounds book. Please and Thank You is really good too. There's some RS author controversy out there -something about the books not all being truly written by the RS author.. 
 I'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with.  However, my public library has a limited selection of audio books, so I take what I can get.  I am a voracious reader, and I listen to audios to get more "reading" in, as you can listen and do other things.  I much prefer the Lillian Jackson Braun "cat" books, at least there is some humor, and I like the "mystery" part of these books better than Deaver's.  Sorry to all the Deaver fan's out there...I HAVE enjoyed a few of his books, but I get tired of the "same ole-same ole" 
 The songs on the CD are great.  Jane Monheit has a beautiful voice and she performs several christmas classics well.  This "enhanced" version is horrible however.  Sony has "enhanced" this version of the CD so that you cannot import the music into iTunes and then subsequently play it in your iPod.  You can only use it in Sony digital players 
 Unless you buy the multi arcade machines with all the major games including Mr. Do and do it right- the classic collections on PlayStation II are the best.  Unfortunately for plug and play some of the versions are jerked to very difficult levels and not as fun to play.  The monsters in the Pac-Man games are almost always on kill including following you  in the tunnel a lot of the time.  The problems listed with the joystick seem to be accurate.  Galaga was better and Mappy was a lot of fun to play- the most underated classic in arcade history.  But again it's better to get the collections for Playstation II 
 There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know "what happened". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting 
 I love the concept and simple (implied) ease of use of this item, but when I actually used it, it didn't work so well. Some days it worked fine but then other times it would  turn on too early or too late (not at dusk as designed) or not at all 
 "The Goal" was a great book but Goldratt is trying to continue to cash in on that success with this book.  It is remarkably poorly written and an absolute waste of time.  Not one new useful piece of knowledge in this book 
 i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!?  i mean, they're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see!  how hard is that!?  Halo is an awesome game but it's REALLY not hard to figure out what to do!  i mean you'd have to be a complete MORON not to know what to do or where to go.  it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying Cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop, tellin' ya what to do.  but anyway i'm done ranting at you wusses 
 This vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object's future behavior.  People have many connections to a place, which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations.  These emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and "at-will" citizens for a long time to come.  In reading the book, by the way, the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern, American style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends.  It's much more in an old fashioned English amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it's all sort of breezy.  Some may like that.  
 The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...  For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment.  The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV.  They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs.  The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released 
 I agree with jah.I have read both books from cover to cover. Once we are catagorised by gender we lose our individuality. The agenda is clear in both books in they state easily  reputed "facts" about "innate" gender behaviors.The reality of the individual works against these beliefs.I read Gurian's book about men and found myself in his discription of male behavior and I'm a female. I know there is an agenda to have one gender rule over the other and what better way to do it then to lump people into  gender specific behaviors.Brainwashed readers won't question  the integrity of the book,all the while the individual is  weeded out of society to make way for perfectly manipulated  Stepford men and women.I have seen Gurian's homepage,the far  right loves him because he mirrors the same agenda of the  far right for families,men and women 
 This fat volume about food and cooking, packed with anecdotes and trivia and stories, is amusing but completely unreliable.  As a source of information about the history of food, it is useless.  Many of the assertions of fact here are questionable, and none of them are footnoted so you can check them out. The author seems to have taken snippets from here and there (mostly, apparently, from French sources), sorted them thematically, and uncritically assembled them into a continuous text.  No doubt a large proportion of the assertions here are true, but there is no way of telling the difference between the true ones and the others!  What's more, the translation is poor.  Not only are some gallicisms rendered word-for-word (and so only intelligible if you translate them back into French), but there are no translator's notes for topical references.  I cannot recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in the history of food 
 Do not confuse this with the Real thing. i found teh VHS of this for $1 at a store near me. I was interested so i got it. I watch Iron Chef on the Food Network evey night, and this dosent even begin to hold a candle to it! The one commentator is a failed comedian, and the other is a culinary half wit!I never heard more ussless facts in a 90min span b4 in my life. The chefs in the first baattle were, for lack of a better term dissrespectful, i mean come on how are you gonna have a cell phone on you and answer it During a Cooking battle?!? They kept cutting away from the cooking to show interview clips with the chefs. The Cooks were pretty good, they had a decent talent but we didnt get to see as much of it here as you do on the real show. There Flour reporter keeps bugging them thru out the whole thing, asking questionspassed down from the dumb announcer.They kept tryign to play shatner off as a culinary genius but come on we all know that he is nothing but a medeocore actor....out side of star trek or wat ever he was on. The only you see shatner is when he is talking about clearly prewritten statements that sound kinda incoherant lol. All in all i give this 2 stars, and that purely gose ot the merit of the chefs, not to the shows them selfs. Unless your a shatner Fanatic, or sone won thats just kinnda like "its cooking, I'll watch it" but be warned. Its not as good as it could be. Glad i only spen $1 on it bc its truely not worth more 
 I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years. When he is at his best, heis books are VERY good. I used to think that even when he's formulaic, at least his books are always entertaining. Recently, I've had to reevaluate him. He can write books that are bad. I was disappointed by "The Taking", and now this... I've been listening to this as an audiobook, but now I'm turning it off. I usually don't write reviews on books or films I don't finish, but this one, I had to give up and feel abliged to warn others.   I made it almost halfway through the book, waiting for something to happen. I really don't care to know how the story ends because it's hardly started yet. There are several parallel plots, all overwritten, with long portions of text where nothing happens and too many characters that feel not realistic, but constructed to be likeable and/or funny. I've always liked the way Koontz writes characters you really get to know and care about, but this time it's way too overdone. They can't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves and have endless dialogues that doesn't move the plot forward. Something must happen for a book to be interesting.  I was a big fan but I'm going to be very cautious about his books in the future. I'm not going to waste more time on this one. Not recommended even (or perhaps especially) for Koontz fans. 
 Jenny does not have to use God's name in vain to show her nonbelief in a Deity and love DOES mean having to say you're sorry, and meaning it.    Watch "Charly" (it is a wonderful film even if you're not LDS).  Even though the girl dies at the end, just like this one, the film is not utterly depressing, like this one.  There is still light and life and hope and faith for the ones left behind to live on.  Perhaps that is what believing in God does for people--it does not necessarily make you a good person (just as not believing does not necessarily make you a bad person), neither does it guarantee salvation in the next life or a heavenly life on Earth, but it does give us hope--hope that we will see our loved ones again, a hope which Oliver does not have.  Once is enough 
 Amazon's price for this title just went up almost $20, and it's out of date; the publisher's website indicates the 2d ed. should be available 4/20/07 at $50 and covers the 2.2 exam.  
 If I can prevent anyone from wasting time and money on this book, I will be pleased.  It is written on the level of a bad high school newspaper.  Moreover, although it is a coffee table book, clearly intended for English speaking readers who are not familiar with Indian cinema, it is not organized to translate the Indian film titles into English, and it rattles off those incomprehensible names without ever describing what the film is about.  IT IS NOT WRITTEN BY ISMAIL MERCHANT!  He wrote the foreward; and I don't know why he did that.  
 I bought a paperback copy of Unexplained Mysteries of World War II, at, of all places, the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. I am a World War II buff and it looked like an interesting and somewhat offbeat read. It was that, and in general I enjoyed the book until I became aware of numerous factual errors and numerous instances of what appear to me to be copying from other sources.  The most grievous factual error was on page 160 in the People Who Vanished section, dealing with the B-24 bomber Lady Be Good. The story says that other than a few bits and pieces of clothing, etc., nothing was ever found of the crew. This is incorrect, and could have been verified with even some casual research in the library or on the Internet. In fact, all but one of the nine crewmember's bodies have been found and recovered. This is set out in great detail in the book, The Lady Be Good - Mystery Bomber of World War II, by Dennis E. McClendon. It was published in 1962 and updated in 1982 when new information about the Lady Be Good's final mission was discovered. Diaries recovered from two of the crewmembers gave stark details of their doomed but determined trek north to try and escape the limitless desert.  On page 174 in the People Who Vanished section, the book stated that the U.S. Navy was unable to explain why Flight 19 vanished, despite an exhaustive investigation. In actual fact, the Navy's 1946 report lists a number of Facts, Opinions and Conclusions based on multiple sources of evidence.   More than a dozen specific factors were cited that led to the loss, the changing of any one of which would have resulted in a different outcome: the failure of Lt. Taylor's compass; Lt. Taylor's unfamiliarity with the area; the fact that none of the airplanes had an operable/accurate clock; bad radio reception; delays in sending out rescue airplanes; inability to obtain a prompt RDF fix on the flight to help guide it home; the onset of night, which meant the pilots were ditching at sea in the most hazardous conditions imaginable; failure of the teletype system to keep shore stations apprised of the situation, etc. A good summary of the information can be found in The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved, by Larry Kusche, first printed in 1986 and updated in 1995. The Navy is not mystified about what happened to Flight 19 - they screwed up, got lost, and died.  On page 166 of the People Who Vanished section is told the discovery of the ship Rubicon adrift in the Florida Straits in 1944, her crew nowhere to be found. While newspaper stories at the time hinted that something odd, the final paragraph of the New York Times story about the incident indicates that the ship was moored in Havana and the lines may have given way during hurricane-force winds, blowing the ship out to sea sans crew. Again, see The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved, by Larry Kusche. This is another non-mystery that is shown as such by examining all the facts.  On page 28 of the Puzzling Events section, the advertisement for the game The Deadly Double that ran in The New Yorker just a few weeks before the Pearl Harbor attack is discussed, and it is stated that an unknown person who did not identify himself placed the ad - and that the man later met a violent end. In fact, the couple that placed the ad, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Craig, were interviewed by the FBI and completely cleared of anything other than being involved in a rather odd coincidence. The incident was discussed in some detail in The Broken Seal, by Ladislas Farago, first published in 1967.  My final comment is in regards to pages 58-59 in the Odd Coincidences section, A Couple of Mixed-Up Britons and A Postcard with a Unique View, and page 177 of the Peculiar Premonitions section, Churchill's Sudden Impulse. While I realize that all of these incidents drew from some of the same sources, it strikes me as odd that they bear a striking resemblance to the way the same incidents are described in Mysteries of the Unexplained, Reader's Digest Association, published in 1982. 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 I'm not sure what I expected, but I vaguely remember James Frey, author of "A Million Little Pieces" saying this was one of his top five reads; I couldn't believe it!  I must confess that my mother and I (she's a young 83, I'm 48) have created our own little "Book Club" that is bi-coastal - it gives us one more thing to talk about when we chat on the phone.  At least she finished it; disappointed!  Every time I picked it up it seemed to wander aimlesslesly from one subject to the other, without much regard to the pace.  I felt I was constantly on siesta!  From now on we're sticking to the classics - this felt utterly pointless 
 This book was lacking something. There were alot of times in the book where it dragged and I was tempted to put it down. I was simply disappointed with this book. I don't think that E Lynn put enough thought into this one and so far it has been his worse 
 These reviews are all really suspicious to me....   when someone wins an election with one-hundred percent we call that...fraud.  Anyway, I've seen this book and it ain't all it's cracked up to be.  The consumer should be aware that Berlitz, INC has become a notorious exaggerator of its own worth.  Critiques of Berlitz-related products are often so gushy and ecstatic with delight that they leave the reader believing that they could only have been written by Berlitz staff.    Berlitz products are notorious among foreign-language education professionals for their lack of exercises, their scanty grammatical explanations, their inflated prices, and the flashy pseudo-science of their famous "method" (a gussied-up listen-and-repeat scheme).  The informed consumer will take the time to compare Berlitz "method" products with other, often university-related course supports. The focus of university-generated products is generally less on the marketing and the cultivation of repeat-buyers and more neutrally, disinterestedly geared towards the linguistic enrichment of the student.  The business traveller is particularly ill-served by methods that promise enormous bounds in fluency across short time periods.  These travellers often find themselves seduced by grandiose promises--often while under high-stress conditions [foreign travel, foreign-language presentation preparations]--and end up rather disappointed for having been duped.    Any "method" that claims to produce fast, effortless results is suspect.  Most "methods" are marketing illusions dreamed up by sales teams.    The Berlitz method, in my opinion and in that of many language professionals, is the foreign-language-learning equivalent of a get-rich-quick scheme.   I have been disappointed by their products and teaching in every case I have ever crossed WITHOUT EXCEPTION 
 I was disappointed in this book because I expected any book that is exclusively devoted to exterior house color and paint to have info that is not readily available for free on any paint and/or home improvement site for free.  It did have nice photos, but few examples of each home style.  Many of the color combos will be "dated" in just a few years too 
 The author attempts to confront her rape, beating, and abuse by men in her life but she avoids her own anger and rage about the male violence perpetrated onto her.  She remains the "good girl" and subsumes  her anger into a semantic term "fierce" compassion.  The title of  the book is rather "nice girl forgives once again".  Except now  she learned from her male roshies that growing up to womanhood means we no  longer need to be silent provided we forgive.  And since we are not  compassionate enough to kill all violent males, we cannot do much more than  laugh at our own anger.  What's so fierce or compassionate about that 
 First, here are some general positives about Jaci Velasquez:  - She is a very gifted singer. Her vocal range is top-notch - definitely on par with Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera.  - She is beautiful. And unlike a previous reviewer, I do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty. I like beautiful singing voices. I like beautiful women. There's no difference.  - She has great spiritual depth. Her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love, faith and joy.  Now, here's a critique of the CD:  I listened to all the music samples (as you can do as well) and only one song caught my attention - "Lay It Down". The other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste. But the song "Lay It Down" was different. It sounded more acoustic, more in the style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music.  I found the sound clip of "Lay It Down" to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970's - Eric Carmen's "All By Myself", later covered by Celine Dion in 1996. "All By Myself" is a ballad having a soft, understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus. The sample clip of "Lay It Down" appears to be in the same mold. It has a soft, understated introductory verse; however, it seems to lack an explosive chorus.   Listen to the sample and hear it for yourself. The introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics:    "All of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans    Are slowly slipping through my folded hands"  So far, so good. There's only a piano and a violin accompanying Jaci's soft vocals. Next, the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics:    "So I'm gonna lay it down    I'm gonna learn to trust You now"  Now here's a problem. I am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of Jaci Velasquez to showcase her voice. But it is not forthcoming. Why?   This intrigued me and I wanted to hear the whole song but I did not want to purchase a CD for only one song. Luckily, I discovered that a compilation CD of Jaci Velasquez's best songs was released recently and it contained "Lay It Down". Great! I bought the CD - "On My Knees: The Best of Jaci Velasquez".   This is what I discovered after listening to "Lay It Down".  - The first time through the verse and the chorus, the song is definitely understated. We simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with Jaci's soft vocals.  - The second time through the verse and the chorus, a drum beat is introduced and Jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs. But somewhat to my dismay, this is not the same voice that I am expecting from Jaci Velasquez. Her voice was more raspy and raw (actually, it was sounding more like Demi Moore or Tara Reid, not that that is necessarily bad). Furthermore, she appeared to be struggling.  Is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as "On My Knees", "Speak For Me", and "Adore"? Is Jaci Velasquez losing her voice?  I don't know but I find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid-20's is losing her voice. She is entering her prime. Barring a health issue, this just doesn't happen.  "Lay It Down" is actually a pretty good song. In fact, I am almost of the opinion that it may be her best. I certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others.  "Lay It Down" has the same message as the Beatles' classic "Let It Be". The words are different but both songs share the same sentiment. Actually, now that I think of it...they do share a couple of words in common...the words "let it be". Here are the closing lyrics:            "I'm gonna let it be, I'm gonna let it go            I'm gonna lay it down"  The essential lesson being conveyed is learning to "let go and let God" - a profound spiritual insight. Something that each of us here is learning.  This song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching. And though her voice is struggling through it, the song, nevertheless, works out its magic.   I gave this CD 2 stars because I think Jaci Velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded. Interestingly enough, her best sound was her first CD - Un Lugar Celestial (A Heavenly Place). Bring back the spanish/flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound. In my opinion, the acoustic sound is more spiritual. Keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects. Develop a Latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz. Hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player. Emphasize ballads. That should do the trick 
 I had pretty high hopes for the book Changing Minds: The Art And Science of Changing Our Own And Other People's Minds by Howard Gardner.  It looked like it would be a good book for learning the art of, well, changing peoples minds.  Instead it was an academic journey that I found difficult to draw applications from...  Contents: The Contents of the Mind; The Forms of the Mind; The Power of Early Theories; Leading a Diverse Population; Leading an Institution - How to Deal with a Uniform Population; Changing Minds Indirectly - Through Scientific Discoveries, Scholarly Breakthroughs, and Artistic Creations; Mind Changing in a Formal Setting; Mind Changing Up Close; Changing One's Own Mind; Epilogue - The Future of Mind Changing; Appendix; Notes; Index; About the Author  Gardner puts forth his theories of mind change based on three factors...  four "entities" of mind change (stories, theories, concepts, and skills), six "arenas" of mind change (from nations down to one's own person), and seven "levers" of mind change (all words that start with "re", like reason, resources, and resonance).  He uses a number of examples from history to show how ideas and people were able to move others from one mindset to another.  On the surface, it sounded like an interesting premise that I could apply in my day-to-day activities.  And at times, the writing almost succeeded.  There'd be glimpses of the person behind the writing, almost as if there was a conversation going on.  Then there'd be a retreat to academic analysis and pacing that made it a chore to slog through.  His attitudes and preconceptions are also quite evident.  For example, he seems to hold Darwin and his theories in high regard, while denigrating "fundamentalist" Christianity.  Granted, this wasn't a book on keeping an open mind, but I didn't quite want to be labeled as ignorant if I don't happen to agree with him or hold the same views in life.  Someone who is heavily into academic theory or the study of the human mind might well find this interesting.  But if you're a busy professional looking for practical insights to work with, this is going to be a real stretch.. 
 I bought it because of Robert deniro and the low price. It wasnt worth it. The picture quality is horrible, it looks like a bad tape... the color is constantly changing and the picture is very grainy. The sound is nothing to brag about. And besides all of that, the movie sucks. Robert Deniro has a total of about 2 minutes of screen time, and he says maybe less then 10 lines.  And whats even worse than that- the dvd that I bought had a picture of Deniro that wasnt even from this movie! sat away from this one, spend a little more a better movie 
 I was excited to get this muffin tin so I could make a dozen muffins for my boys at a time and for a cheap price, but like they say, you get what you pay for.  The tin is nice to start off with, but it rusts all over VERY easily.  So now, after I know that, the rust pretty much never comes off all the way and so I am stuck with it.  It is still very suitable for use with muffin cups (liners), so oh well 
 This software is very hard to use. The help video goes too fast, the manual doesn't cover everything and nothing is intuitive. I have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money 
 Gosh, I'd hate to be a student in a Wong classroom. Wong's book is an endeavor in positivistic manipulation, a recipe guide aimed at reproducing good little consumers who never question the authority figures in the Foucauldian nightmare world Wong and his fellow behaviorists have conjured. What Wong does not seem to realize is the children he obviously sees as objects in need of control and manipulation are going to be adults with little capacity for critical thought and decision making after 13 years of suffocation in any school under the thrall of the Wong way. Add the fact that the "practical" tips in the book are completely useless in 99 percent of the public school classrooms, and the Wong book is not only a waste of money, but a real danger to students subject to teachers sucked in by Wong's platitudes 
 I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails 
 I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it. Pros - saves money on razors - good on large areas - entertaining if you're bored Cons - no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits) - ingrown hair can be a problem (especially in the bikini area) - hair doesn't grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth) - the epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it. 
 I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it).  Unfortunatley, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.  Alas!  This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.  The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.  Skip this one 
 After falling in love with their first two albums and praising them among all my friends and family and taking the time to learn their songs by ear on my guitar, I couldn't have been more excited to listen to buy their third album. However, once I did, I couldn't have been more disappointed. The great bands find a way to naturally evolve their sound and conquer new ground without losing their identity or their "soul," so to speak. But where Kings of Leon went to and why is a mystery. Their grit, simplicity, and soul is gone. No more driving beats or bluesy riffs or plain old rock 'n roll passion. The music seems more processed and belaboured and washed out. There's nothing to tap my feet to, and certainly no great riffs that'll make me learn these tracks on my guitar. If this is the way Kings of Leon is headed, I certainly won't be following them. What a shame 
 This is a dishonest book.  The authors claim to have invented a `diversity measure' for each place, giving the percent odds the next person you meet on the street will be of a different ethnic origin than your own.  They peg the U.S. average at 54 percent.  They say, ". . . diversity makes a place a better place to live," and that it "brings value in differing points of view, differing interests, and different cultures to learn from."  Now for this book's dirty little secret: By their own figures, almost all of the 100 places they feature are less diverse than America.    You can't have it both ways.  If you're going to piously celebrate diversity, stop steering readers away from diverse Dallas or Charlotte or Chattanooga to lily-white Flower Mound, Matthews, or Hixson 
 Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
 The book certainly had occasional interesting points. The author does know his history. The story could have been told in 400 pages.

 This is a waste of black ink on white paper. Save your money 
 I understand the power of overcoming adversity, but as the seeds travel, one of the "drowns," one dies in the desert, one is eaten by a bird...I think it is a disturbing little book, actually.  It certainly should never have been made into a board book.  There are too many words on the page to keep the attention of a toddler or preschooler.  The ending seems abrupt as well.  I haven't been impressed with the Carle books I have read 
 I had to read this for class.  Regardless of the content, navigation through this interface will be maddening to anyone familiar with things like the "internet" and I bet if you're reading this you know all about surfing the web. It is hard just to get to the point where you feel like you are reading anything coherent at all.  Then there is the text, typical pomo ruminations on fragmentation and identity with some wonderful feminist theory thrown in.  Made me wish for an early death.  Avoid at all costs.  
 Too many pieces have been performed with stringcord instruments, and I just don't feel good about the sound of classic piano. This is just my personal taste, I guess 
 How about:  three centuries of gossip in the world of theoritical physics and mathematics...it's a lot closer to the content of the book.    Why do most physicists and mathematicians have to write about the human side of those who contributed to their fields instead of discussing the topics germane to their to main ideas.  I really would like to know about the constants, what their importance is and how they were discovered and developed, not about a debate at a conference in some place I've never been in 1879.  I had hoped, and had believed, that this book would discuss each of the constants in detail.  But, after weeks of teadous reading, I came to the end with my wish unfulfilled.

 Leafing through every page of this famous book, I found it utterly useless for anyone who's vegetarian. Four of the meatless recipes were useful, though not particularly appealing in terms of taste. 
 After reading how many people said that this book presented a balanced examination of the "mysteries behind the da Vinci Code" I looked forward to reading this book. I was especially interested in what all these "experts" in diverse fields had to say. If you are looking for a mix of pro da Vinci code and anti da Vinci code people have to say, a sort of balanced presentation and response, you will not find it here. Only after I spent my money did I think to google the various contributors. Some are legitamate scholars. Elaine Pagels for example is a true scholar of gnosticism. (Some of her assumptions about gnosticism can be questioned for example how can a derivative work by gnostics written 500 years after the New Testament was written be a better source of Christian history. The standard approach is to put more weight on earlier documents than later - but I digress)The same could be said for mathmaticians, and some of the others, but they all are somewhat out of the left field. Others of the "scholars" are anything but scholars. I suggest you start googling names and make up your own mind. At any rate this is not a diversity of viewpoints as others claim it to be 
 Stop me if you've heard this one:   So these girls go into Afghanistan, then one of the most repressive theocracies in the world.   They are -- get this -- missionaries, and they wander around trying to convert the "heathens" to Christianity, which is a little like opening a synagogue in 1930s Germany.   It would make a good sitcom, in the tasteless manner of "Hogan's Heroes," but it makes a lousy book.  Religious zealotry is the worst thing on the planet and these two crullers merely wanted to exchange one type of fanaticism for another.   
 I am notorious for liking bad natural disaster movies... but this is awful, even for me. The effects were awful (the opening sequence is just ridiculous), the acting very poor, the overall effect is not very interesting. The best acting was done by Xander, but this performance was mediocre for him. I just wasn't impressed at all. I'd rent this before thinking of buying it. I'm sure glad I did 
 I'm sorry I wasted the afternoon reading it....was about the worst thing I have ever read in its category.  Would have liked to rate it as NO stars but that is not an option.  Just happened to read it because it has been sitting here for 4 years since my mom died and I took i 
 This was a promising-looking book.  It has a good number of very interesting butterfly pictures, attractive diagrams of bedding layouts, and photos of useful flowers.  However, I was greatly disappointed by two things.    First, the personalities of the multiple authors intrude too much in the book.  Not only do we read too much of "I" this and "my" that, but the potted biographies are sometimes much too long, self-regarding, and irrelevant.  Are they promoting butterflies, or themselves?  Second, I quickly got the sense that the butterfly-gardening discussion is really a Trojan horse for environmental activism.  It lectures repeatedly at the reader, when the reader feels like saying:  "Stop trying to convert me!  I bought the book, didn't I?  I'm happy and willing to make a garden that butterflies might like, and that should be enough."  The moralizing starts with the preface, and continues with the introduction by E. O. Wilson.  Wilson wags his finger at "prideful Homo sapiens," saying that people are mostly "indifferent or repelled by the generality of insects." Apart from stating that Homo sapiens has every reason to be proud of its accomplishments, I would like to add that people have (naturally) feared insects for excellent reasons:  mosquitoes bring malaria, the West Nile virus, and other diseases; pests spoil crops and contaminate food; and the bubonic plague, spread by rat fleas in Europe in the mid-1300s, wiped out one-third of the human population.  So don't lecture us about how we're just mindlessly prejudiced against insects (or anything else for that matter).  There are several books on this subject currently available.  If you are looking for a book by garden-lovers, for the benefit of other garden-lovers, I would advise you to choose one of them.  I would certainly recommend Attracting Birds and Butterflies by Barbara Ellis. 
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 I love love tegan and sara and when I found out this was one of their favorite cds I have to admit....I think i was devastated. I just saw pretty girls make graves last night and they really could not have sounded worse.Not just not enjoyable...unbelieveably horrible. I think you should take your money and spend it on a cd that actually sounds like good music. Don't make your ears go through this much pain 
 Let's consider 'Why Not Me' a trial run for Al Franken's better written follow-up 'Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.'  All of Franken's work bears the hallmarks of his sketch comedy background - it's an ensemble of pieces, some of which work, some of which don't.  In 'Lies,' roughly 80% or more of the pieces hit the mark (I wasn't a fan of the cartoons).  In 'Why Not Me,' it's about 50%.  Like the Bob Woodward parody ('The Void'), for example: funny for about the first five pages (you laugh when you see Franken's nailed Woodward's melodramatic scene-setting and habit of assembling conversations as if he were in the room).  But it drags on and on.  How many readers got though the whole piece?  Not many I bet.  Like others, I agree that the campaign diary worked the best, followed closely by the faux Newsweek piece - the classic campaign shot of Franken chopping wood with Golden Retriever at his side is a howler.  Talk about spot-on.  I think the best part of the entire book is the 'one issue' campaign (elimination of ATM Fees) and how Candidate Franken steers all discussion back to that point.  Watching both Bush and Kerry try to route every question back to stump speech set pieces makes you realize that there's sometimes a fine line between parody and reality.   
 I have three qualms with this book:   1. The characters become so painfully annoying over the course of it's 175 pages that, by the time the story has completely unfolded, we just don't care about what happens or might happen to them.   2. The book takes the moral highground. This is perhaps it's greatest flaw; the narrator, David, is painfully opinionated on all that surrounds him. I know this is something that can never be completely avoided in a first-person narrative, but it could have been handled with a lot more grace than what Larry Watson has done here.   3. The story is uninteresting. Not meaning to belittle Larry Watson's talent as a writer, because he certainly has a knack for descriptions of people and place, but we simply don't care about the majority of the events that unfold.   Read something else; save yourself from boredom and disconnection. 
 Critique of Neumann: The Case Against Israel    On page 6 of the introduction, the author states " . . I do not discuss legal issues . . some times the law is wrong. For similar reasons I say nothing about UN resolutions . . like laws they may be wrong." Since the State of Israel was founded based on the UN Partition Resolution of 1947, there was no need to write the remaining 188 pages to "prove" that  Israel is not a legitimate state since, in the gratuitous opinion of the author, UN resolutions have no relevance nor applicability, because "resolutions might enjoin what is right or what is wrong." What the author claims he will "prove," he thus axiomatically states at the outset. I have a Ph.D. in philosophy, and I can assure you that does not constitute acceptable methodology.  From this negation of the binding nature of UN resolutions it follows, in the opinion of the author, that the state of Israel is illegitimate and its establishment presented a mortal threat to the Arabs of the region - again, this is a gratuitous assertion without proof or evidence - and excuses all violence and atrocities as "self-defense" on the part of the Arabs of the region. Today it is easy to convince one's readership that UN resolutions don't mean much; today's UN is largely discredited because of incompetent leadership and its many failures to reach its lofty goals. But in 1947 - two years ofter its founding - the UN was the noblest and best hope of humanity to resolve issues between peoples through reasoning rather than by making war. Thus, it might have been more profitable to probe whether the human race has yet reached the requisite level of civilisation to f  ulfill this hope and, if not, why not?  More importantly, perhaps, to explore the possibilities for the Palestinian people, had they taken the first opportunity in history to establish a state of their own, and worked constructively at building a workable society. One might have asked - if one wanted to approach this problem from a moral point of view, as the author claims - by what authority their leaders advised the people against that constructive course of action and instead, instigating fear and war and hatred, wasted - so far - three generations of their people?  In my opinion, THAT is an inexcusable crime. In the same overbearing vein, the author derisively dismisses the excellent work of Joan Peters "Since Time Immemorial," which in examplary fashion gives original sources for every factional statement, in stark contrast to the present author who deals primarily in opinion, not facts, and whose 95% of already scant source material is contained in the work of others who are not exactly recognized authorities on the subject 
 For those of you whose children grew up with "Conjunction Junction" and other Grammar Rock songs, it is probably  time for you to buy this DVD set for your grandkids! This collection has all of the songs that you remember (and probably some that you don't!) I recommend playing it on your computer for easier navigation to the videos that you want to see. I do not recommend downloading the software that comes with it. It was quite difficult to navigate. Simply use the media viewer that you already have installed on your computer. I really give this product 5 Stars; the 2 star rating was an accident that I can't remedy. 
 Basically the title says it all.  I figured for a 100 dollars I would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge.  Basically this is a poorly made toy that shouldn't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred.  Like I said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the Tru-Break Putt 'n Hazard.  The only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 This book gives just a general overview of cat care.  It is good if you have never owned a cat before and need just general info.  I was disappointed because it didn't give many specifics on Persian cats 
 this must have seemed like a great idea at the time,"cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor". the problem is his range is all the way from a to b.   this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many "chance" happenings. in the end all we get is this "thriller"(and i use the term very loosely)that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling 
 This is the second time Daisy Ashford's famous book has been filmed for UK television. Sadly, this is the less succesful version. The whole appeal of the original book was seeing and hearing about the world through the words of a nine year old Victorian girl. Her unique spelling, opinions and ideas - mostly romantic notions about how adults in love behave -  make for hilarious reading.   This BBC TV production changes much of the original material to suit it's own purposes, which completely obliterates the artless innocence of the book. Worse still, they have actually made up new lines, supposedly in the style of the original book, and yet actually left out many of Daisy's original and memorable lines of dialogue along the way! They have also added new characters and even devised new mis-spellings that Daisy Ashford never included...what a mistake! It's impossible to embellish a piece of work as original as "The Young Visiters" just for the purposes of padding it out into a full length movie...it's a unique piece of work that sprung from the mind of a nine year old girl, and written circa 1890 - what script writer today could possible emulate that with sufficient accuracy?! So, the overall result is a mildly amusing but perplexing comedy of manners with the characters delivering odd speeches and unfathomable mannerisms, and seemingly unable to spell when they write letters to each other. As a TV programme, it just doesn't make the charm of the book come to life.   The previous version was made way back in 1984 and seems to have disappeared completely now, but it was in fact better than this effort, plus it starred Tracey Ullman, who was hilariously well cast as the pompous Ethel. And the cast got to concentrate much more on the original immortal dialogue, unlike those roped into this mess. None of the humour stands out in the new version, even though it has a stirling cast and a big budget. If you watch this and enjoy it, that's great, but in my opinion the spirit of Daisy Ashford's book has been all but wrung out of it 
 I love cats, which is why I bought this calendar, but I am going back to the regular Workman Publishing Page-a-Day.  You cannot believe the poor quality of the paper and pictures.  You have to strain your eyes to look at it.  Keep away from this calendar and don't waste your money.  Also, it's not particularly clever 
 A pamphlet would have accomplished what this guy said in the entire book!  I wanted to strangle him!  Repetitive, condescending, overly simplified and so BOOOoorrring!!!  Here is the nuts of it all:  Pick a stable stock with a narrow spread between bid and ask.  Buy 2000 shares and then sell it 1/16 higher right away.  Everything else is simply preamble... over and over and over.  Hope I saved you 20 bucks 
 I can see why the Lox don't like to talk about this debut. This sounds as if Puffy did the whole album.  Puffy and his Bad Boy production team produced most of the songs and it sounds like complete rejects from his No Way Out album instead of a Jadakiss/Sheek Louch/Styles project.  Money, Power, Respect with DMX and Lil' Kim is the only strong song on the album. And what was the point of having the Mad Rapper on this album? Even the Hitmen's offerings come off as lame.  The Ron Lawrence/Deric Angelettie song come off as lousy.  And the ones from Nashiem Myrick, Stevie J and Carlos Broady come off as mediocre. But the low point is the pop-driven sound of If You Think I'm Jiggy, which Puffy produced and what worked for Mase doesn't work for the Lox. The song blatantly interpolates Rod Stewart's 1978 disco-driven hit Do Ya Think I'm Sexy. It's got a catchy beat a la Puffy, but the song's pretty bad and overly commercial. Out of 40 to 60 songs that Puffy produced in 1997 for artists, that's his worst!  The lyrics on the album come off as materialistic and don't tell me too much about the group's background. Jadakiss had harder-edged rhymes and lyrics on the Lox' 2000 album and his solo stuff, but there's nothing he really offers here. The album's commercial sheen comes off as creatively empty. They should have let Puffy rap on this album instead and called it The Four Beats to Shake to. 
 A weak story line and a confusing plot ensured that I was complete lost somewhere in the middle of Jamica in the first few chapters.Was disappointing to read this work of Ludlum, who otherwise has had an untarnished reputation so far 
 In this award-winning novel for young people, all the black people (with possibly one exception) are honest, kind, hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and good looking.  All the white people (with one or two exceptions) are cruel, dishonest, malevolent red-necks, who persecute the "colored people" for no reason at all.  Historically, there's some truth to the setting and events, and we all admit that blacks were sometimes persecuted in the past.  But that was then.  This is now.  Times have changed, but young people are still required to read this one-sided tripe.  Let's hope that English teachers will eventually recognize this poorly written novel for what it is. 
 I was disappointed with the book because it is not for the average cook.  Too many of the recipes have unusual ingredients, and they are not satisfactory for my needs.  I give the book a 2 rating, although I'm sure that more adventuresome cooks might find it excellent. 
 I bought this movie set for my nephew and have to say that I was unpleasantly suprised to hear the language used in this "Cartoon".  Fine if your child is 13 and you don't mind, but NOT for little ones 
 This book was a major disappointment. It is little more than a wish list of ideas with no hard data or really useful information. It varies from a few lines to a few paragraphs on each job idea, with little or no information about legal issues, taxes, licensing, zoning or other basics of running some of these businesses. Can you make money doing the things listed in here? Certainly. Will you have a good grasp of how to do it safely and legally? No.    If you have absoutely no clue about what a person can do for a business, this book might be of some small assistance in getting you started thinking about it. I don't find it to be of much more value than that.    I would recommend instead one of the more detailed books, like "The Best Home Businesses" by Paul and Sarah Edwards, or even a look at the Yellow pages of a large city. Then, do some serious research on the actual businesses that you think you would like to do.    
 Very disappointing and BORing! NO likeable characters, VERY uninteresting story.  Could/Would not finish--too many "better" books waiting 
 This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless 
 I actually returned this book because it had very little , if anything, to do with WHY you actually compulsively eat. it did not go into or even explained the psychological factors that influence C.O. all this book talk about is how women's self-image is polluted with diet ads etc, etc. it does not deal at all with how to actually stop, in an effective way.   same thing as Overcoming Overeating. the whole point of the book is to stop dieting and to stop having a dieting mentality. also it doe snot deal with the actual cause of you overeating ( which is not dieting)   if you really want to overcome overeating and end your obsession with food, you need to know why you are physiologically addicted to food. why you find so much pleasure in it. and for that you have to read books with substantial research, not just a feminist sound-off.   read : the pleasure trap, LIfe is hard- food is easy , to name a few good ones.   but this one and her other one won't help you at all. 
 I study leadership, politics in business organisations and emotional transactions. I bought this book thinking it would be factual, conclusive and real. On the other hand I found it's written with a mocking tone, has no relation to real cases and is as shallow as it gets.  It could be good for some peasant who believes he can get ahead at work easily. But in reality, there's far more than this book wastes time about 
 This program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.  The art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn't look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak.   The worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the "action" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don't feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I.   This first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and more frustration than satisfaction. Save yourself the pain. 
 Examples are few and offer little explaination. I find this book so hard to follow.  On a good note: algorithms are clear 
 Nothing but a lame excuse to show the overrated Barrymore's face on the screen again 
 I am extremely happy with this product.  It works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick.  It's a superb design and I am very pleased.  I would highly recommend it 
 The untruths of this book begin on the cover, which purports to show a very blurry Israeli aircraft gun camera shot of the Liberty (more complete views of the image are in the book).  In reality the Liberty had big white identifiers on the bow, one quarter the height of the ship, clearly distinguishing it from Egyptian ships.   These numbers have been photoshopped out of Cristol's gun camera images, apparently.   Here is an experiment for skeptics: google for a similar high-angle frontal photo of the Liberty on the web, blur the photo in your favorite program until it looks like Cristol's gun camera photo, and see if you can still discern the numbers.   You WILL still see the identifier, if only as a big white splotch, though it is completely blacked out in Cristol's photos.  Why is this significant?   Because any pilot would have seen the big white American numbers too.    Don't believe me, don't believe Cristol, but try it yourself 
 Having used the Owl Clip Light with success previously, chose to order through Amazon (to a secondary provider)for a gift.  The gift finally arrived, broken and unable to be used.  Also, at the same time, ordered one to keep for future gift - it has never arrived. Probably will never order through a secondary provider again

 The premise - that one could change specific events in ones' past through psychic concentration - could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller.  I don't condemn the film's corollary either: that each change produces new, unforseeable tragedies.  It's the way the story is told - its ham-fisted dialogue and plot, its forced obscenity at every turn - that reveals its teen sensibilities.      It is therefore fitting that the director's preferred ending is included here.  It is the perfect catharsis for teens who "...wish I was never born! 
 First of all I want everyone to notice that this is only VOLUME 2.  Volume one is no longer available anywhere.  Thus, making this book fairly useless.  The only thing that it's really good at it showing different stiles between professional comic book inkers.  It nice to page through and I don't regret buyin it but it is not necessary for an artist's library 
 I found the following on PCRM.org website: "Celebrated Food Network star Emeril Lagasse offers among the worst of the celebrity books. Although he offers a few low-fat salads and vegetable dishes, most of the recipes are loaded with fat and cholesterol. From ham hock wontons to chicken pot pies, these dishes should be off-limits for anyone with a weight problem. 
 The first Butterfly Effect is one of my all-time favorite movies. With that in mind, I eagerly started watching BE2. Within the first 5 minutes it became clear that I was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie. But after finishing it, it was clear that I would have to flat-out lie to do that.  There is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie: Erica Durance naked. But it's too softcore, short, and pointless to really be worth anything.  The writing is terrible. The story is lifted directly from the original, only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion. It manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical, a feat unparelleled in modern film. The protagonist comes off as an idiotic, self-concerned, petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with. The acting is...barely passable, for the most part, but the story's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express.  The first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this? Would this one be the last? In the sequel, this is gone, but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting.  If you have any fond memories of the first one, avoid this turd 
 Here is the deal, there is a lot of material providing many, many options in this book.  That being said, most of it is not incredibly "imaginative".  For example, a PC in one of my campaigns wanted to play a samurai type character so using some of the guidelines in the DM's guide we constructed him as a standard fighter with a few extra touches (early access to Weapon Specialization, intimidate as a class skill etc...) and a few penalties (fewer bonus feats, required alginment, allegiance to a lord etc...).  My point here, is that as far as the core classes, prestige classes and most of the other stuff in this book, a bit of imagination, some compromise, and a few free hours will let you build the whole volume from scratch without having to shell out the money and at the same time, giving you quite the sense of accomplishment.  Take the advice of the DM's guide   "The standard character classes fit into virtually everyone's campaign.  They are flexible, and skill and feat selections allow them to be truly customizeable 
 My son received this for Christmas 2005 and played with it every day. The conveyor belt is noisy when running and the sponges that whirl around at the end of the car wash were constantly falling off and getting lost. After a month of being played with on a daily basis the conveyor belt stopped working - it still made plenty of noise but didn't move anymore! When I called Mattel they couldn't offer me replacement parts as the toy was discontinued in 2001! Although they gave me a voucher to buy a replacement toy, it wasn't for as much as I paid for the toy. 
 I seriously didn't like it. It is definetly not for the young and weak hearted. The characters were not likeable and the fact that everything was sexual was not exactly a positive feature. It sickened me, and i really felt bad after finishing it. Truly skip this book, it's not worthwhile, please i beg of you don't read it. I'm incredibly disappointed in Richard Peck in this one 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick.

 How would you feel if you invested in Google and they decided to dedicate 1% of their resources(employees, capital, assets, and time) to the community?  You'd be pissed.  Their stock price would probably drop at least 1% every year due to wasting resources on activities that are outside their core competencies.  This is why the government pays 100.00 for a hammer - they don't know how to make them themselves.  Imagine 4,989 google employees spending 3 days (1% of their yearly effort at work) driving corn oil fueled buses to New Orleans to pull people out of dwellings that been flooded with toxic waste.  Even better lets send them to Irag to count votes.  Maybe a few will get decapitated for their kindness.  In either case their healthcare costs would rise sending the stock price down a little more.  By the way which community should we help first?  Do we take a poll?  Is it based on demographics, need, or should we pick a community out of a hat.  And what about the employees?  Maybe they don't want to help anybody?  Is this in their job description?  Adam Smith and Alexander Hamilton would have to have a duel just to figure out who gets to kick the authors ass first.  
  This story was about a boy named Robin who could not move his legs at all. His mom went to go see the Queen and his father was fighting the Scots in the North. While they were gone he stayed with a lady named Dame Ellen. One day she left and did not come back so a monk took him to a hospice. He wrote a letter to his father to meet him at Castle Lindsey. They met each other and soon his mom came home, by then it was Christmas time. They lived happily ever after.    I would give this book 2 stars because it did not hold my attenttion at all.   I did not like this book at all it did not hold my attention.                                                                                                                             
 Why? Because it underestimates our intelligence! It has nothing to do with natural health. It has to do with advertisements. It is empty, completelly. More: it looks like a woman magazine but I believe that a clever woman would feel like I feel now, angry! I paid for something that I believed but it is not. OK, we make mistakes 
 Love this movie BUT the transfer was so pathetic that I returned it to the vendor. This DVD is absolutely the WORST transfer I have ever seen. MGM goofed on this classic 
 I thought this would be more than a "You go, Girl!" book of cheers. I was wrong. There might be a few passages that are encouraging to read, and thats valuable. However, I bought this and a few other books to expand my knowledge on the art of seduction and influence... my mistake 
 The author displays an alarming lack of understanding of European history and Christianity (especially Catholic Christianity.) He uses several negative assumptions about Christianity, some of them easily disproven with a little research, to compare it unfavorably with Islam. Simultaneously, he promotes, throughout the book, his own relativistic and pluralistic value system which ultimately holds nothing to be objectively true 
  Ok now I am afraid to try any other Our Gang DVDs! No one mentions how poor the sound is, so that it it almost impossible to understand what is being said! This made this DVD worthless in my opinion 
 I started reading DC comics in the late 1980s, so everything I've ever known has been post-Crisis.  I'd often heard that "everything changed" after Crisis, but for me it didn't matter because as far as I was concerned, this was how things had always been.   I've seen countless references to this series over the past two decades, however, so I figured it was finally time to see what all the talk was about.  The Writing: For some reason, I had formulated the impression that this series was well written.  Perhaps that idea was based on the assumption that people don't spend two decades talking about a story that's poorly written.  Well, apparently they do.  Marv Wolfman's writing is painful to read.  Characters constantly refer to themselves in the third person (a horribly awkward way of helping readers learn their names).  The heroes give hackneyed soliloquies to explain why they're fighting the good fight.  The villains give equally trite speeches to explain their motives.  Perhaps all comics had such cheesy writing in the mid-80s; I haven't read much from that era, so for all I know this was just par for the course.  But Crisis took place during Alan Moore's run on Swamp Thing, so certainly not all writers were as clumsy and stiff as Wolfman.  The Art: George Perez has plenty of fans, but I can't count myself as one of them.  I won't dispute the fact that he has loads of talent, but his tendency to fill every page with as many panels as possible just leaves the whole thing looking like a cluttered, chaotic mess.  (In Perez's defense, there's really no way he could have done it differently, due to the extreme wordiness of Wolfman's script.)  While I appreciate the effort to include as many characters in the story as possible (it was, after all, a celebration of DC's 50th anniversary), I wish Perez would have exercised at least a small amount of restraint.  Just because you can fit 200 characters on a single page, it doesn't mean you should.  By focusing on everybody, the series really focuses on nobody.  Overall Value: Crisis may have been important in its day, but nostalgia is the only value that this series has anymore.  Yet if it's nostalgia you're seeking, you'd be better off looking for the original 12 comics on eBay.  At least that way you'll get to read them the way they were originally presented.  This collection suffers greatly from its sleekness.  The updated coloring and the glossy pages give the collection a feeling of modernity that is completely at odds with the story itself.  Read this series on pulpy paper with muddy coloring, and you might be able to appreciate it for what it is: a relic. 
 I love the Backyardigans but this book is not worth purchasing.  The pull tab system they use is very difficult and hard for children to do themselves.  The pull tabs are supposed to be pulled to two seperate settings but they get jammed easily (especially when pushing them back in).  Needless to say, my book was broken the first day I received it 
 I've owned one of these for about a month.  It's a total waste of money.  It rarely sprays, just a steady stream of oil.  I'm diabetic and thought this would be a good way to restrict my use of oil on salads, etc.  I am so very disappointed......   I'll try to find another brand that is more reliable and that does what it's advertised 
 I had been using a Hauppauge MediaMVP Digital Media Receiver (Model 1000) and quite happy with this $99 device. I was able to play my recorded videos and show my vacation photos on a large screen but it died mysteriously and I thought I would upgrade to this more capable (or so I thought) device. I had lots of problems getting it working correctly and used it with 3 different media servers (both the one that came with the device and the Windows media server worked for me).  I use the device primarily to watch shows I time shift from cable. There are two features that make this $200+ device far inferior to my previous device.   1) The fast forward is "fast" in name only. Perhaps it doubles the speed but it does not seem that quick to me and I spend a LOT of time watching stupid ads. In addition to FF the Hauppauge had a feature that would skip 30 or 60 seconds at a time that made missing commercials a breeze. There is a "jump" feature but that lets you enter the total time into the clip you want to be so if it actually worked (it froze the device each time I tried to use it and I had to unplug it to even get the thing turned off) it would be a pain to use.  2) When I had watched part of a video the Hauppauge remembered where I had stopped and offered to restart from that position. Image my frustration when I clicked the wrong green key (sending me to the video menu) about 2 hours into a movie. To get back to where I was I had to slow-forward for an hour to get to see the end of the movie.   Who ever designed the software that the remote uses should be ... (well I will leave it to your imagination). So after mucking with this for to long it is going back to Amazon and I am going to buy another Hauppauge 
 Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:  http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
 I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing 
 I bought this book, the paperback version. The text is good, it describes all his letters and tries to do a lot of explanations too. However the prints of his paintings are not that impressive.  They are very dark prints. Go for some other book if you want to see the corect colors of his paintings 
 This book is an absolute waste of money. I bought this because I enjoyed her other book "Travel Photography" which is quite good but this book is probably the worst I have bought.  The information is out of date and wrong in quite a few sections. Worst of all the photography is probably the worst I have seen and is printed very poorly. Based on this I dont know how she got where she is. Money spent better elsewhere 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 This 2002 copyright book I bought (thought I was getting most recent version) is not a good book. Dont buy it. Way too much fluff.   PDF File on CD didnt work at first. Eventually got it to work, but shouldn't an adobe file work wihtout having to contact tech support 
 I just received this CD in the mail.  It is TERRIBLE!!!  It almost sounds "tinny."  Like it was coming through a $6.00 radio.  There is a lot of background noise like a record has and there is almost no bass.  I gave it 1 star because it is the Blues Brothers and there are some great songs on it.  I also have the original soundtrack ordered.  I certainly hope it sounds better 
   My daughter had to have this play set to go with the toddler doll (they are advertised in the same commercial). It is cumbersome, clumsy and difficult to play with.  It requires more assembly than I would have liked and more space for play that it seems.  It is just an awkward toy 
 The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities."  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one 
 This book is written very badly.  Every sentence has the words "like, you know, like, OMG etc etc" Waste of money. 
 The movie is ok but it is a superior film in Cantonese. The dubbed English is awkward and detracts from the film. I find the "dubbing" very annoying and would prefer the vintage Hong Kong Jackie Chan films marketed in the US be provided in the original language. Argggh 
 This book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (I think 10? 12? I don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had AIDs and writing a book on it. Except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.  All well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. Noooo. It's the slashy overtones where there REALLY REALLY SQUICKILY SHOULDN'T BE ANY! I should NOT get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. No, no, NO.  I felt dirty after reading this. I felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.  This is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath. 
 Not only is the popcorn incredibly salty, but they do not taste very crispy.  Quite stale.  Overall, disappointing.  I sent my stuff overseas with delivery within 4 days after receiving them, so it is not that I kept them too long.  Too bad, they are too far to return.  Overall a disappointing experience 
 ONCE UPON A TIME, Moorcock, a FANTASY writer (despite his pretentions) who created a character called Elric (his claim to fame), wrote some pretty entertaining stories about an albino prince (which was more or less a sensitive, middle-class man's reaction to Robert E. Howard's great macho superhero, Conan). Unfortunately, like many other authors,  the fame went straight to his head and he became a pompous intellectual type whose years have since been devoted to leftist soapboxing and tearing apart some of the great writers of fantasy fiction. Spare us, Mike, and go back to what you were best at: writing enjoyable escapist fiction. Your political views are completely molded from a life spent living the soft, pampered lifestyle of a middle-class Englishman and I'd rather not be subjected to your myopic philosophies and political opinions while reading an Elric book. Actually, wait a minute. As a matter of fact, I guess I don't have to be subjected to your blather at all. Indeed, I shall never read another one of your silly books again after slogging through this one (the last straw, it was) -- at least anything older than your original Elric series.  PS: Funny that as much as your hate Howard and Tolkien they'll always be remembered more than you.  
 I love world literature. As much as I can, I try to broaden my literary horizons and explore literature that isn't completely well-known in the Western world (esp. those by the most arcane authors that I wish were more recognized!). I have read many so far by Halldor Laxness and other authors of world literature, many which I truly love and will always have a special place in my heart. Of course I don't expect every novel to be this way, regardless if it's a classic or not a classic. At the end it's about what I get from it. The Tin Drum, for me, is the most intriguing, interesting, and unique novel that I've ever read. But it's also the most frustrating and pointless book I've read as well. I'm ambivalent. I like the book for its very original character, Oskar, an "eternal three year old," and some vivid scenes and chapters that were heartbreaking, if not just downright bizarre (such as the horse's head filled with eels, Oskar's mother's strange suicidal attempt, etc). Also, I give Gunter Grass a lot of credit for writing a novel that takes place during Nazi Germany without having the Nazis and actual events during WWII become the primary focus of the character's psyche (in fact, because of the character's childlike and caustic narration of the events that happened, at times you kind of forget that there's a WWII!). Without a doubt, this is an original piece of work that definitely deserved all of its accolades, and yes, it's a classic. However, I feel that this is the kind of book that leaves you scratching your head. It's not a horrible novel, it's well-written, and the characters are realistic and likeable. But yet, you can't help but feel that this book is a bit pretentious (does it necessarily need to be nearly 600 pages?), some chapters aren't worth reading and feel more like filler (you can skip over some and still understand what's going on), and the character becomes a bit redundant. Yeah yeah i know, the main character is in a mental institution, and yes, he's insane, but how many times must he emphasize the significance of his tin drum? This is just my opinion of the book, some people seem to love it, and the reasons why they do are very clear. But as I said before, regardless if you are an avid reader of world literature or just a casual reader, this book is not for everyone. You either love it or you don't. Some scenes I enjoyed, and I was touched by some of the character's inner thoughts, but it's not enough for me to praise this book as some people have. Sorry, but I just didn't like it. 
 For a machine that needs to be serviced regularly they need to check their customer service department.  I've had the machine for a year.  had to have it replaced becuase it just didn't work when we got it.  then 9 months later the dryer broke.  a month after they fixed that it broke again!  I've had it with Haier and plan on telling their management what a horrible product and service they provide 
 Given the alternative of singing "Yo ho ho" while drinking a bottle of rum or watching this version of "Blackbeard," take the rum.  This is one of the most tedious pirate tales yet told.  Director Kevin Connor who brought us "Motel Hell" & "The Land that Time Forgot" will probably not add to that distinguished resume.  Mark Umbers plays the lead of Lt. Robert Maynard.  Umbers was previously in "A Good Woman" with Helen Hunt & Scarlett Johansson.  He approaches love and danger with much the same expression.  Obviously cast for his good looks, a more shallow performance from a film/mini-series lead would be hard to remember.  As William Teach, AKA Blackbeard, Angus MacFadyen does an admirable job of swashbuckling.  His sleeveless vest and chubby arms doubtless make him an excellent candidate for many 18th century deodorant commercials.  After appearing in "Saw III," "The Virgin of Juarez," "Jason & the Argonauts" & "Braveheart," his lead in this turkey will probably not land him a fan base.  Jessica Chastain plays the object of Maynard's romantic affections.  Her good looks & redheaded stubbornness make the most out of the meager script.  Her only other credit I could find is a documentary called "Salomaybe?"  Stacy Keach who many remember as Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer does a brief job as the captain against whom Blackbeard mutinies.  Probably the best performance is by Rachel Ward as the rough & tumble barroom owner.  Best known for her work in "The Thornbirds," she has two Golden Globe nominations, most recently for "On the Beach," as well as an appearance in the "Wide Sargasso Sea."  Her appearances light up the screen.  Richard Chamberlain hadn't worked since 1999 when this project came along.  At this rate, his next acting job should be in 2013.  As the effeminate Gov. Eden, he isn't really evil, just swishy & boring.  His past work shows talent, but this playing against type does not work for him.  The pacing of this 2-part mini-series makes you long for commercial breaks, which the DVD doesn't offer.  If you're looking for an entertaining evening's film, keep looking.  Taxi! 
 i bought this movie after being blown away by the actor/director's masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle.  while it contains similar humor elements and near-anime-type action, it's really not worth the buy, and you would be better served by purchasing Kung Fu Hustle which is much funnier and overall a better production. i probably watch Kung Fu Hustle once every couple of months, which is no small complement 
 I give this album 2 stars out of 5, and I AM BEING GENEROUS - primarily because while the Cafe Tacubas play some of their greatest hits onstage, with 100,000 screaming fans, nobody actually stops and notices that while the songs may be (mostly) good, this is really NOT A GOOD PERFORMANCE!! I saw this band live on a few ocassions, and it seems to me like they were at the top of their game right until the moment they released Reves/Yo Soy; a double album of experimental soiunds and forgettable tunes that may be best compared to Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music" or the Works of Yoko Ono. Most of the rave reviews listed for this album come from some of their uncondictional fans.But even they would be hard pressed to admit that they only listened to the album maybe twice at most, and then chucked the entire 3 disc-set into the pile of "I'll listen to these someday" CDs. Do yourselves a favor: Buy their first 3 albums and call it a day. This band has had it. And i still don;t forgive them for Reves/Yo Soy. 4 Caminos was not a good album either 
 I liked this when it arrived.  However after a few uses the pestle broke in two.  The pestle is hollow and apparently quite fragile, making it of little use 
 It's hard not to love the idea of this book, just as it is easy to hate marred execution. A fascinating botch job, but still a botch.  As seems to be the case with the authors of many social histories, Kuh is so enamored with the fact that he got to this idea first--and it is a "why-didn't-I-think-of-that? one--that he inserts his story into the mix; in this case, he'd like to see a parallel to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist--but he ain't Joyce, and clearly isn't much of a cook. He's a great hypocrite, however: I found it hilarious that a guy critiquing culinary elitism continuously throws out french dishes without translating or providing an explanation of the dish. You will be amazed at how little discussion of food there is in here.  I won't dwell on the grammatical errors or preening prose--other reviews have--but I will say that the most dishearterning aspect of the book is the author's inability to get over himself, which severely limits his coverage. Clearly, he's not good enough of a writer or thinker to understand his own bias--because he fetishizes the past; makes his time in the kitchen (60s and 70s) to be the most important era in food history (of course!); and then tries to act like a distant, objective journalist for the present, treating it like clinical, lifeless business. This supposed distance kills the book's intent: instead of tracing the evolution of the American restaurant, he ends up lionizing the past and trashing the last twenty years of professional cooking, which get few pages and absolutely no discussion about the food produced. It's remarkable, given all that has transpired in the last 15 years, that he spends no energy on the fact that America is the culinary center of the world, yet can come back to talk about Henri Soule again and again.  The book you're looking for has not been written yet 
 I'm sick of this song!! It's overplayed...Can you people stop loving Green Day so much. They suck. 
 **This review pertains to the audiobook version, not the print version.**   The narrator (Mirron Willis) does splendid voice characterizations for all of the characters -American, British, Ugandan...  All except for the Scot, Nicholas Garrigan.  Willis makes the Scottish doctor sound mildly retarded or speech-impaired (or both?).  Unfortunately, since the doctor's voice predominates throughout the book, I just couldn't bear listening to the whole thing.  Too bad.. 
 DO NOT BUY THIS PUZZLE FOR YOUR CHILD! MY DAUGHTER HAD THESE PUZZLE AND THE SCREWS HOLDING THE ITEMS TO THE WOOD BOARD COME APART. THEY ARE VERY SMALL SCREWS AND NUTS THAT I ACTUALLY FOUND IN MY DAUGHTERS MOUTH. I CONTACTED COMSUMERS AFFAIRS LAST YEAR ABOUT THIS PUZZLE AND I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT IS STILL ON THE MARKET. I AM ONLY WRITTING THIS SO THAT AS A PARENT YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE SCARE I DID. 
 Your better off buying your favorite comic books then buying this book. Problem is he's trying to adapt to the Marvel House of style. You don't need extream foreshortening to be a good line artist. The book was rushed and done for money. There is a DC comics book out there with Klaus Jansen and Draw magazine published by twomorrow is a better bang for you buck 
 As I am reading this book, I'm going "huh?" and "what does that mean?" and "this is like poetry, apparently..."  I can't say I liked the writing style (such as it is), but it did create word pictures and pulses inside me despite my desire not to like the book!  It is a mood piece, at least to me.  Not a writer I would buy again though.  Sorry 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.  
 Do not under any circumstances read this book. I love Catherine Coulter and think her books are wonderful but was sadly disapointed with the Valentine Legacy. The caracters are boring, there is absolutly no romance and no sparks between James and Jesse and it makes for a very long and boring book 
 We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other.  This is such a small locket, that it will be very hard to put a picture in it.  Also, the locket is very, very hard to open.  The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed.  Now it stays together, my daughter loves it and wears it every day, but I would have bought a different locket if I had realized how small this is, and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn 
 If you want to read a Classic of Western Mythology, look no further.  This is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth' about reality.  The tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives.  Dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality, and when evolutionary 'science' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy,' this view will come out false.  This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it.  What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.  If the conclusion is OUTRAGEOUS, you don't, "bite the bullet," "swallow the medicine," and accept the conclusion anyway.  You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is.  It took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why Zeno's argument that 'nothing moves' is incorrect.  But during that period of time, NO ONE (except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals' like this Dawkins character) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves 
 I was one of the original Talking Heads fans since 1977, wore out every album on vinyl and own most on CD. I still think Stop Making Sense is one of the best concert movies made, and so, even tho Mr. Byrne's solo career has been erratic, it was with a real sense of anticipation that I dropped Live at UC into my player.   What a disappointment. This is a very heavily and oddly orchestrated disaster where he backs himself with nothing but strings and percussion. I think any time you see pages of music being flipped on music stands, it's a bad sign for a rock and roll concert, but this approaches self-parody.  Video closeups of anoymous violinists  finishing energetic solos with a satisfied grin look like a Saturday Night Live satire. Mr. Byrne sings gamely, but his voice has clearly lost range and its edge for the  Talking Heads classics. The pace of the concert is brutally slow and shots of the audience look understandably enervated. To make things worse, he repeatedly interrupts the concert in order to indulge himself with interview clips, where I have to assume he is aspiring to be enigmatic and Dylanesque, but just appears to be rather boring and obtuse. Overall the effect is annoying.  I'd say if you are a diehard David Byrne fan, you may find some diverting moments on this disc, but if you're looking for a good rock and roll show, avoid this like the plague and pick up Stop Making Sense 
 There are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews.  This is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. But what is more notable than that is the fact that  the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.  Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.  Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.  To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting.          
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 This book gives a good example on how a scientific work should NOT be written. Assuming things, putting them as facts and then not proving or explaining them is like pure speculation. There is no scientific background given and the reader is left in the dark. What evolutionary biology is about and what serious researchers are stiving for is compeltely being disrespected by this kind of writing. There are people who are putting their heart into this kind of work, but Mr. Devon cannot even write a fluent understandable text. What a shame to all the serious work!  
 I bought this for my 2yr old who has a speech delay.  There were only 20 signs and more than a few were common signs that we already knew.  My son does like watching it but as far as learning new signs it was a bust 
 The product is virtually worthless.....After making all possible adjustments the devise is totally unreliable.  I would really like to get my money back because the thing is already in the garbage 
 I was disappointed with this purchase.  "Vaxxine" got me excited for this disc, but sadly, the remaining songs don't compare to the fire of the lead track.  Mid-way through the CD I find myself very bored by the uninspired chugga-chugga guitar riffs. On the brighter side, the vocal harmonies are a plus 
 When Professor Polk describes the sweep of history in Iraq, he is at his best, but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts.  Much of the political ranting is supposition, marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work. The ranting gets especially tedious towards the end.  My advice, read the first part and skip the last half 
 Throughout Dr. Shealy's book, he continuously touts his products. After a while, the repetitious branded names of the SheLi TENS, Dr. sHEALy's Essentials tablets, Dr. sHEALy's Youth Formula tablets and his Biogenetics Magnesium Lotion makes his book sound more like an infomercial than authentic informative research. Whenever there is product pushing involved in a book like this an alarm of caution should immediately sound. There should be cause for concern that findings may be created or embellished as a way of selling them instead of providing accurate research and truthful information 
 I cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we've seen in films like "baby boy". Almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word. He didn't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance. I don't know what this film was about. There are parts where there is a long silence with no talking. The whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house. There are a few scenes where the characters are running around  without any obvious aim. The film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying, "what was all that excitement about?" 
 Yes. I opened immediately when UPS delivered the window fan and it got a severe crack casing!!Got to return to Target minus off my shipping charges! Sad 
 I've purchased seven items from Amazon in 2005, so I'm not a complete rookie. This item's ad title includes the word "Battery" in big, bold letters . I purchased this kit advertised with a "Used Price", but "Condition: New". The ad picture clearly shows a battery. I had looked at several ads and did not read the individual Seller's comment "BATTERY MISSING" in uppercase, though in regular font. To me, a missing part warrants more of a warning than a "comment". That's my "lesson learned", but I still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big, bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing. LESSON LEARNED: READ THE WHOLE AD FOR THE SPECIFIC SELLER, ESPECIALLY THE "Seller's comments" 
 This story definitely did not seem age appropriate.  This book is recommended for children ages 3-8.  Two of the pigs are eaten in the story, which can be disturbing to younger children.  The size of the text is enlarged during the times when the wolf is being `bad' or danger is being introduced.  That is a good way to allow the reader to raise his or her voice at these times while reading, but again, that can be scary for a child to hear.  The colors in the illustrations are a bit dull to set the mood of the sad, scary story in my opinion.  The plot is alright and somewhat easy to understand and follow.  But I highly do not recommend reading this to young children.  They would not predict that the pigs would be eaten and that the wolf would be eaten at the end.  A way to use this book in the classroom would be to read a few other versions of the three little pigs to the class and compare and contrast them.  Have the students work in groups to formulate similarities and differences of the characters, plot, setting and more 
 I liked this book until I started calling people. doesn't stand up. 
 I think this book marginalized and almost ignored the most important case in human rights and human rights violations. Where is the Israeli-Palestinians case and why it's missing from Mr. Schulz book, is it because it will show the obvious contradiction between what USA says and what it actually do. What happens when the interests of the United States collides with the human rights. These question and many others needs answers in order to support the arguments made by the author 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 I bought this book because I read other customers' good review comments.  I have to say "Don't buy it"!  The book is only introduce you some simple procedures on how to take a test.  With your common sense, you will be able to tell your child all about it.  Plus, the price is really a rob.  ...  I was fooled.  I hope you won't 
 What a vapid collection of women.  With the exception of Susan, none of the women are sympathetic.  If there is one thing to take away from the novel it is this: don't go out with ANY man who claims his marriage is far from over.  Wait until it actually is over.  If a man can be "stolen" or if he wants to be "stolen" then he isn't worth your time and the legacy of frustration that will follow you for the rest of your life.  And the women just sit back and talk about how the first wives need to get on with their life - as if having one's life thrown upside down is something that is as easily recovered from as having a cold.  One of the characters spent two years stalking her then-married boss and is surprised when the first wife doesn't just rollover and be satisfied with the new changes to her life.  What do you expect?  And for the record, I am not a first or second wife, but I hated this book nonetheless.  If I want to read about selfish, vapid people attempting to control the world around them and then being unable to cope when the world bites back, I'll pick up a newspaper 
 This book is NOT for the one-man/woman small errand running services. It is really geared toward a MUCH larger operation. I found the book no help at all and a great waste of my money. Perhaps I should have done extensive research before ordering it- lesson now learned 
 This book is absurd, ridiculous; chiefly... THIS IS NOT A TEXT FOR SCHOLARS!!! The title should be "Egyptian magic for modern aspiring sorcerers" or something like that.. 
 I was hoping, and was led to believe by the listing, that this item could be used with a MAC and a PC. THIS IS NOT THE CASE! In fact, Seagate does not recommend transferring information between a Mac and a PC using this hard drive. Unfortunately, I found this very important information on the third page of the user's guide. Very disappointing 
 I've used several other versions of this product and this seems to be the one that works the best and is the most durable.  The design makes it easy to insert and remove IPOD (unlike the newer versions) and the elasticity of the armband makes it easy to slide on and off one's arm.  I would highly recommend this product.   
 The Decemberists are wonderful performance art, an exercise in demonstrating just how gullible the indie crowd really is. Will they swallow a precious, pretentious, pseudo-english, neo-prog, ren-faire-reject band that delivers lines like "Meet me on my vast veranda / my sweet untouched Miranda / And while the seagulls are crying / we fall but our souls are flying" with perfectly nasal ernestness?  Will they ever.  It's a 5 star practical joke, making up in success what it lacks in subtlety. But if you buy it, the joke's on you 
 If you do purchase this device make sure you write down the serial number.  Supposedly there's a sticker on the back that has the serial number on it.  My switch failed after a week.  Since there was no serial number on my device the manufacturer has decided not to provide product replacement even though it's their unit and has their name on it 
 Cool ball, but hope you don't have too much stress. Mine blew up in my hands and now I have red ink all over my cubicle, hands, face and clothes. It washes out of my shirt because it is black, but my white undershirt and light blue cubicle are ruined-stained forever.   Turns out the ball was defective and had a slight "blemish" that wasn't noticible until I sqeezed it. I was staring at it thinking to myself, "Gosh, this could blow up." When --"Blasphpt!!!" I was gooed by my "stress ball." Now I know why they call it such. I really am stressed about having to pay to get new cubicle cleaned. My $10 ball cost me $50 in cleaning.. 
 I read other reviews about the poor disk quality but thought I'd get luckly, which I didn't.  The very first episode skipped and finally stopped altogether near the end.  I tried it on 2 different players with the same result.  Cheap double sided dvds.  I expect more of the same on the other episodes.  A great show treated shabbily with cheap disks.  If you haven't bought Hart to Hart yet get that instead.  
 This album is not terrible, it is quite adequate and even sophisticated in a background music sort of way..It is just not very engaging on the forefront though..We all know Alex is a masterful programmer, but the famework that surrounds his beats this time generally does not hold the listeners attention, the album is mostly a showcase for the spastic and weird, rather then evolving beats that engulf a listener into the most immersive experience techno has to offer..You could definitly track this artist's waxing and waning of artistic zeal, with this album continuing Patterson's return to his more dancy, breezy roots, while incorporating the more twisted, dark elements of his post ultraworld releases. 
 Ordinary People is an atrocious book. The subject matter is morbid, the flashbacks of the boating accident are incomprehensible, the dialogue will put you to sleep, and there's even a pre-marital sex scene between our emo protagonist, Conrad, and that skank, Jeaninne. Conrad's parents have to be the worst in the world. The mother is a recluse who bottles up her feelings around her son and his supportive father is a borderline alcoholic. I was forced to read this book in high school and it just made me feel depressed and disgusted. Please, stay as far away from this book as possible 
 Very much in need of a revision. The authors made mistakes on the maps in this edition. In the past we depended on these series to guide us around Europe and thought they would lead the way for Maui too. If you purchase this book, buy a current map to go with it 
 This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate "big secret" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.  The book was billed as "darkly funny and satirical" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time 
 I just bought the latest model the 5000 and the machine is good but the price is quoted wrong. According to the Manager of Vitamix they add tax at all times so the price you see is not the price they charge at vitamix. If you go through ANY vender they always add extra claiming tax. So if you authorize the price they will attach tax in addition to it. Check your statement when / if you still choose to order. You will have to call your credit card company. 
 The title speaks for itself.  I don't know how or why I was drawn to this magazine when I was 14. This magazine should be called J-4tweens. Ah. The title is very annoying. Like Twist, I only get this magazine when I'm really really desperate for something to read. I sure as hell wouldn't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara. If you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress, get this. The only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things (but of course). Other than that, no. They feature pretty bland fashion. All in all, this magazine is JUST like Twist. Therefore, the age reccomendation is just 11 & 12, but you're better off getting GL for even more years worth of goodness (10-15 yrs.) because no, it's NOT cool to steal your sister's damn boyfriend for pete's sake 
 This book poses somewhat of a conundrum.  Is it an over-thought monologue on the author's own hair color, or an exceedingly dull scholarly treatise?  The answer: it is both!  It's a hodge-podge of historical references, anecdotes, and Patty Scialfa.  Never delving deep enough into the history, it manages to still lay on what it does say with an all-too heavy brush, dripping with overindulgent prose.    In the end, it is sound and fury signifying... the onset of sleep.  If you are in need of a never-ending supply of sleep medication, save yourself some money and buy this book.  If not, don't bother.  
 The intro is tight, the rest just sucks... End of review! 
 It is not the Tracy Chapman you will be expecting to hear. This album is a complete disaster. I wish I had not bought it.  
 The plastic stand that holds the frame upright broke immediately. Also, be sure to note that there is no memory card. Spend the extra money and buy something better. I wish I had 
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 In the beginning this book seemed to have potential. It told of the direct Msonic influence present in the foundation of the Untied States. This was the preface. Afterwards the book endlessly drags on, with dates, times,  people, and places; everything except what I expected; a testimony of how  Freemasonry affected the establishment of the USA. If you are interested in  reading a book that reads like a high school text book, but really goes no  deeper, if you are interested in when but not why, maybe you will enjoy.  But I doubt it 
 This player works quite well in our home. We just pick it up & move to the next room, outdoors or into the van. The sound quality is better then I expected. Glad I purchased it 
 While this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot, the mistakes are inexcusable.  Many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data. Therefore, one begins to lose trust in the information presented.  Be careful if you use this book 
 If you are looking for a book on how to live on a limited income, this is not your book.  Nina Wildorf seems to live in a world that doesn't involve student loans, car payments, or the idea of a savings account.  Her rule of thimb for budgeting is 20% of your income towards clothes.  This is not fical responsibility.   And only wash your jeans every 6 months so that they don't fade?  Really?  Am I the only one who thinks this is odd?  On the other hand, she does have some cute ideas for decorating on the cheap--I am glad to see that someone besides me goes dumpster diving! 
 Every time I hear that song "One Wish" it makes me want to throw up. I hope he never makes another CD 
 Anything since doggy style by snoop doggy dogg has been less than 3 stars, dont buy any of it 
 Men and women have equal sex drives,deal with it!What makes us  different is the constant shaming women get when they do indeed act sexual.If you have the word "slut" hanging over your head constantly it just might make you want to cling to romance in order to appear less sexual than a man.Gray generalizes,and not only generalizes but makes women out to be sexless objects there to please men and not themselves. He writes as though he has a great fear of men and women being  equal in sex drive.His mysogamist views of women are  disgusting! In short what he says is,the woman only has to look nice for the man,and the man has to romance,begg and trick women into  bed because women in his mind really don't want or need sex. 
 I would rather have thrown 17 dollars worth of quarters into one of fountains at the mall then have spent it on this book. It just took waaaaaaaaay too long to get to the parts about Clay. I can't believe that by page 125 Clay STILL hasn't been invented. 125 pages of nothing but reading about an annoying main character (Davie) that does nothing but smoke cigarettes with his best friend, kind of like a girl named Maria, remember the one time a boy named Mouldy beat him up and think another main character, Stephan Rose, is weird. Seemed like a lot of filler or maybe David Almond, the author, decided he just had to write about his own dull childhood.   Anyway, I don't make a habit out of being mean about a writer's work, but there just were no redeeming factors about this novel except, I dunno, it has a neat cover. I wish I could have the time I wasted reading this book back. I paid full price for it from Borders and fully intend to return it so I can trade it in for a better book. What a waste. I only wish I could give it zero or negative 1 stars. 
 This is a very uninteresting book on the subject.  Much more could have been done about this important subject.  There was absolutely nothing of value in this sheer waste of paper and trees.. 
 Yes there are neat pictures in this book and loads of mathematica code. But that's it: no attempt is made to educate the reader: no list of important graphics programming paradigms, general strategies, etc. This book fails dramatically to meet the high standard set by the marvelous "mathematica book".  The many bugs and common work-arounds of the mathematica graphics system are not discussed at all. I would have wished a chapter about what is NOT possible with mathematica - such a chapter would have saved me a lot of time wasted in searching.  If you really want to do graphics programming, forget about this book and check the excellent mathematica usegroup instead 
 America are allied with suadi arabia, The most fundementalist and extremist Islam nation in the world. They don't care about Islam Extremists, this DVD is totally irrelevant propeganda 
 I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this! 
 Unfortunately I concur with the semtiments of the other reviewers.  I ordered the system based on the writeup in the New York Times.  At least I can save the $40 price by ordering books from Amazon.com.  First, I could not open the CD-ROM, but apparently the program is not useful.  Second, book's main virtue is as a general discussion of book cataloguing and organizing, best suited to a collector of fine books rather than someone (like me) who buys too many and needs to find them at home, rather than duplicating an academic library setting. For the basis of my collection's organization I used The Reader's Catalog.  It works great because of its index to over 40,000 books, a well thought-out plan, and the convenience of being a paperback book with complete bibiographic data on the books. Why type in an ISBN when they are easily available from Amazon or in a book like the Catalog?  
 This book is for people who do not have a wedding budget and who can afford a $100,000.00 wedding.  This book is so dry and boring talking about etiquete it puts you to sleep.  It makes planning a wedding seem like  planning a funeral.  No fun at all 
 I'll keep this review as short as possible due to this book being a very disappointing read.  I did read it with anticipation and an open mind hoping to uncover some gems of wisdom or valuable insights, what I found however as I read on was disappointing beyond words.  Joan Borysenko has a way of talking things down, making many generalisations along the way and often belittling other views on spirituality. This might have been forgiven if she had delivered a strong counter argument and provided us with a solid read however, Borysenko really did not support her theories and argument in any convincing way shape or form at all.  This book will also be quite disappointing for the intelligent woman, it should be re-titled A girls journey to God.  I was expecting more, much more, what I was left with was  a feeling of being let down instead.  I recomend potential readers to look elsewhere as this book plainly fails to deliver 
 There were two things that I really hated about this movie: the music and the forest. I'm not sure where they shot this movie, but the trees looked like they were most likely eucalyptus trees. You'd think they could have at least found a nice dark forest somewhere that would be reminiscent of the dark woods you'd expect in this sort of tale. The poor selection of filming locations might be over-looked, but the incredibly banal music was just unforgivable! I talked to a couple of young kids after they'd watched this movie and they very adamantly insisted that it was a terrible movie. In general I'd say that this movie was on the verge of being amateurish (despite the presense of well-known actors) except that someone did a nice job building the gingerbread house. If it weren't for that element of the movie, I'd rate it at zero stars instead of one star! (NOTE: The child actors did a fine job performing their roles and it is not at all their fault that the movie is so lame! 
  This book is neither about Aristotle nor General Motors.  Do not be fooled into believing it is in any way an application of Aristotelian ethics in modern business; it is not.  Morris consistently contradicts Aristotle throughout the book.    An example is Morris' proselytizing conclusion that leadership requires humility.  To make his point Morris quotes ancient Hasidic verse and the Tao Te Ching to establish that we are all worms.  Nobility, Morris suggests, is lowness.  Did Aristotle ever say this? No.  Could Aristotelian writing lead us to these conclusions?  No again.  Is Taoism consistent with Aristotelian reason and logic?  No, no, no.  Is Hasidic verse? Definitely not.  So what is going on?  Did Morris forget to read Aristotle?  Aristotle understood Man as a rational being with happiness as the moral purpose of his life.  Morris does not.  This book does not.  Morris peppers his book with quotes at the furious rate of no less than one or two per page.  He quotes every thing from fortune cookies to Einstein.  Ironically with all this mad quoting he never once, ever, (I checked) quotes Aristotle - never.     This book could better be titled, "If an irrational populist ran a non-profit organization."     The prefaces of basic economic texts usually contain better discussions of the practical intersection of business and philosophy. 
 This may be the worst book on real estate or mortgage markets that I have ever seen.  The authors seem to be saying "Look how smart we are!"  I have an MBA from University of Chicago and much of the book is a bad rephrasing of inroductory corporate finance.  My book for the real estate class at University of Chicago was by Bruggman (?) and Fisher; although that book will not win any awards, it is vastly superior.  This book could easily lose 1/2 of its contents.  Don't waste your money 
 Just like their previous effort "Nevermind," "In Utero" is more abyssmal simplistic angsty radio-rock for the "misunderstood" teens who think they have the worst lives ever because their parents made them clean their rooms and do their homework against their will.  Kurt Cobain wasn't a genius by any means, his song-writing was terrible along with his "guitar playing."  Back when Kurt was still alive, Nirvana was actually struggling with record sales but after Kurt blew his own head off, that's when record sales skyrocketed and they got the legendary status they don't deserve by any means.  The only talented member of Nirvana was Dave Grohl, and his recent work with Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath) and Killing Joke is way better than Nerdvana.  The death of Chuck Schuldiner (Death) was a real tragedy in the guitar world, not the death of Kurt Cobain.  Chuck was 10000000000000000000x better than Kurt at both playing guitar and writing songs.  Just listen to Death's "The Philosopher" (from "Individual Thought Patterns") and "Crystal Mountain" (from "Symbolic"), and you'll be de-converveted from this joke of a band.  If you're not ready for Death, check out the only worthy grunge band Alice in Chains (particularly "Dirt" and "Jar of Flies"), RIP Layne Staley.  Lastly, Nirvana didn't save rock, it just made it worse.  Thanks to them, we have awful bands like Korn, the Deftones, Cold, Staind, and other nu-metal/a$$rock bands.  
 The central problem in this novel is that a main character can only be too desperate before one begins to despise them.  
 there are a lot of original and wonderful flavor ideas.  many of the recipies are quite pricey to make due to the liberal use of dutch cocao powder.  the basic cake recipie on which most of the cupcakes are based makes a rather dry cake that has a rough texture.  the basic frosting recipie is too dense.  i like the flavors but not the recipies.  i have adapted the basic cake and frosting recipie making the end products much lighter and airier, with good results 
 OMG... I wanted to shot myself after listening to 30 seconds of this nonsense 
 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 What a disappointment!  It is only lacking cartoon illustrations to make it seem competely childish.  But more disturbingly it is deceptively simplistic.  Told through rose-colored glasses, leaving out what is convenient to ensure a "happy" ending. Save your money, wait for it on Vue-Master 
 Unless you are interested in the challenges posed by introducing a number of displaced youth who have grown up in an extremely deprived and disjointed society to the United States, this movie will not "do it" for you.  The most intruiging phenomenon in the entire film is the obvious mistrust and lack of connection between poor African-Americans and poor Africans, beyond the color of their skin.   For the most part, the situation exists between most working-class Africans and the African-Americans with whom they are lumped up with and have to coexist with at work and home (if they live in predominantly black neighborhoods) and is therefore nothing new, unless you are of a different race 
 Unfortunately this book is all politics.  Using cherry picked info to back her views, Ms. Hendershott spins just as well as any Fox News pundit.  Sure, any person with common sense understands that pedophilia is dead wrong, but it doesn't automatically follow that all of the assertions in her book are then true. She rails against Clinton's sexual indiscretion while extolling Bush's virtue, while he lied to us to get us into a war, has approved of torture, works steadily to dismantle all environmental protections and has been at the head of the most corrupt administration in our nation's history.  Hypocricy is also a form of deviance if one believes the truth to be a norm 
 if i could give it no stars at all i would.  maybe its because its not what i expected, but nevertheless, its horrible.  the entire album sounds like something out of a porno, with the same bass lines looped over and over again.  every once in a while some cool percussion is heard, but it lasts for only a few seconds and is quickly drowned out by something predictable.  then again, i wasnt exposed to this beforehand and i in fact loathe this type of house music 
 I rate this book a 1 star because I am a lender... this book is a basic promotion that all brokers are good and all lenders are bad.  I will put it simply and hold everyone's hand like a small child in my review; if you are by chance a Broker, you will love this man's philosophy, however, if you are by chance a Lender/Loan Originator, he will come off insulting and distasteful, and if you are a new consumer looking for advice as to how to get the best loan program, this book will lead you down a path of ill information.  Either way, he does not approach the subject of mortgage lending in an objective way to educate, but rather in a stance to promote those in his field (ie brokers) and slander those in the opposite side of the ring (ie lenders). Disappointing to lead innocent and unknowledgable borrowers the wrong way just to promote your business/field.    
 Ah, true Love.  Dinner by candlelight.  Holding hands in the moonlight.  Snapping a new clip on your Glock while your significant other sprays you with semi-automatic love missiles.  I appreciate a dark comedy as much as the next curmudgeon, yet MR. & MRS. SMITH annoys more than it entertains.  True, there is a predictable plot about a beautiful couple stuck in a rut--a couple who, unbeknownst to one another, are professional assassins (just try to stop that suspension of disbelief train).  Add to that the erotic chemistry between Brad and Angelina; my eyebrows are still singed after watching them.  But all the sexiness and over-the-top, lamebrained action fail to overcome the annoyance of Pitt's detached smirk and Jolie's constant flirtation with wackiness.  As the fighting (boy, is there fighting) escalates, I was suddenly asking myself, "Wouldn't it be great if they popped each other off?"  Maybe in the sequel.  While we're at it, would someone please feed Angelina a steak, mashed potatos. . .something?  Nothing wrong with being slim 'n trim, but come on, lose the East Africa look.  In the long run, MR. & MRS. SMITH's biggest problem was the fact Vince Vaughn didn't appear enough.  At least he gets paid to be annoying. --D. Mikel 
 I was cautiously hopeful for more originality in this release, and disappointed to find very little. I listened to this once and haven't seen the disc since. I appreciated the attempt at writing more songs that involve everyone, not just me and my experience. But beyond that, the CD left me wanting something fresh musically and lyrically, some different integrated musical styles and in general, a sense of diversity 
 Don't say I hate history, but many movies turn history into soap opera. The way they had Catherine kissing passionatly and really, history never mentions that. Peter was a jerk, but I never read that he and Catherine kissed passionatly; that was a waste of time. The movies talents were wasted. If they want to make a soap opera, they shouldn't do history but something else. All the actors act like they are from NPR. The only thing I have learned (for I stopped watching it half-way) is that the Ottoman turks attacked Russia. A&E made this movie for the money. If you want to learn the non-romantic story of Catherine, read about her instead of watching this trash 
 After thoroughly analyzing this book for a college paper I can say that I am no less than disgusted with the content of this piece.  It does nothing more than to bash "whites" as all being racist, biggots, and horrible human beings.  All it talks of is the disadvantages of being "black" and the inability of a person of color to come up in this world.  I wish the author would have analyzed the situation rather than just focusing on putting down "whites" for the sake of making a point.  I find the novel utterly disgusting and written in a poor, distasteful manner 
 It seems like a nice complete set of playfood, except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard, and I've thrown most of them out already.  It doesn't take much to crush them.  There are much nicer sets out there, and there are separate pieces sold on ebay, that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better.  Not worth the money 
 The main problem with this book is its lack of scope - translating a single sadhana from an Indian collection. Sadhanas are a type of text that are largely generic in format and content, and the present case is no exception. Therefore, English's study offers very little new material to either the academic or religious forums. With her confessed lack of knowledge of the Tibetan vajrayana tradition, English is unable to consult any of the vast array of primary sources on Vajrayogini, relying instead principally on correspondence with those learned in the Tibetan tradition.   Despite polite comments on the back of the book by Janet Gyatso, its hard to see how this would be of real use to academics, since there is very little contained within that has not been previously translated from texts within the Tibetan tradition, except perhaps a few previously unknown forms of the deity, which is really only of minor significance to academia.  She justifies her lack of scope by saying the academic community needs in-depth studies focussing on specialist areas. However, if we are to have a 500 page book on every sadhana in the Indian and Tibetan tradition, there will be a lot of wasted paper.   A large section on the book - the controversial claims about the influence of Saivism - is simply reiteration of her tutor Sanderson's earlier work and presents no new insights.  What would have been of interest is a discussion about the Vajrayogini 'byin-rlabs' or blessing, the initiation ceremony unique to that tradition. English barely mentions this, avoiding it on the grounds that it is rather complicated. Similarly, there is little discussion of the Tilopa lineage of Vajravarahi or Gamapopa's subsequent modification of it, again one of the areas of the Vajrayogini tradition not so far widely discussed in the West.  It is hard to see how Buddhists will benefit from this book which, whilst written for academics, is clearly being marketed towards Western Buddhists by the publisher. If they seek teachings on Vajrayogini from academic books ordered from Amazon.com, its clear they are pursuing one set of teachings whilst ignoring others from the Vajrayogini corpus (esp. the Vajradaka explanatory tantra) which explain all practices must be received from a qualified vajra master, i.e. lama.   English suggests a better name for this sadhana collection would be Vajrayogini-sadhana-mala. I would suggest the original title, Guyha-samaya-sadhana-mala (i.e. secret commitment), was more than adequate; its a shame she didn't consider what the compiler was clearly recommending!  I'm not sure which is sadder - the fact that there is another book selling the secrets of the esoteric vajrayana tradition, or that Oxford University is now issuing doctorates for such guff. 
 The first time using the product it got jammed and I have not been able to open the machine up due to its malfunction.  I need to exchange it for a new pasta maker, however, I do not have any of information to do it.  It was thrown out by mistake.  Could you please send me information on how to exchange the machine for a new one and then I could be better at rating the product 
 The author endorses genocide of the white race, This is now acceptable in our society. He should be run out of the country 
 I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS 
 I used his book as an MBA student 15 or so years ago.  Now as an adjunct professor, I am using this newest edition in my undergraduate classes. Although my observation may be biased, the book is a bit too encyclopedic,  a bit superficial in coverage, and fails to excite the students.  I wish it  were more up-to-date 
 This movie is for liberals what the Left Behind book series is for Christian conservatives, it portrays reality how they want to see it. Its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much PC political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it. Entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall IMO 
 Cheap mixture of basic body language knowledge and psychology catered to the masses. Very shallow and some of its comments show a unbelievable degree of narrow-mindness (Comments like "if you look like this, you are like that" are all over the book). Very disappointing book, comments like "If someone speaks about sports a lot, he probably likes sports" (page 63) say it all. 
 What a terrible biography!  Leon Wagener's book is full of inaccuracies, is based upon "interviews" conducted with those tied to Armstrong that many of the interviewees claim never occurred, and is yet another shameful example of a writer with marginal talent propagating the same tired, FALSE urban legends about the first man on the Moon that have been circulating for decades.  I look forward to the day when Mr. Armstrong will allow a true writer to accurately and justly tell his remarkable story.  Leon Wagoner should stick to his day job as a writer for Star Magazine!   
 I picked up this book because I thought it might make a nice bedtime read for the kids.  They enjoyed "The Animal Farm" a great deal on account mainly of the talking animals.  But I guess making lighthearted tales of whimsy for the children is not good enough for mister fancy writer.  This ones almost downright depressing.  Plus theres sex!  Good thing I read ahead a little bit or I would have to answer a lot of questions thats for sure.  I guess this is how they wrote books back in the 80's but it wont fly in 2006 I tell you what.    Why is there no option for ZERO STARS?!?  Oh well ONE STAR for you then Mr. Orwell 
 "When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'.  
 This book is guaranteed to make you fall asleep. Some people take a glass of warm milk, others taking sleeping tablets; But this book has absolutely no side effects and is can make *anybody* fall asleep within 10 minutes! Try it for yourself.. 
 Polemicists seeking to slander Chomsky regardless of facts might take pleasure in this work.  But, knowing Chomsky personally and having read his works thoroughly, this book misrepresents his arguments to create a pastiche bearing no resemblance to the man or his ideas.  Chomsky never relished 9/11.  The scion of Hebrew scholars, he hardly hates Israel.  Indeed, he briefly lived on a kibbutz there in the 1950s.  He does see Israel possessing significant freedoms and a press more vibrant than America's, but is also very critical of Israeli policy toward Palestinians and presents arguments to that end in the tradition of Avi Shlaim.   While one can certainly disagree with Professor Chomsky's ideas, this book is hardly the place to familiarize oneself with them.  It is more in the tradition of tabloid than scholarship.  For those seeking intellectually honest critiques I suggest looking elsewhere... 
 A complete waste of money, even at 1 cent. Once applied the screen is significantly less viewable. The "clear" shield is about 10% opaque! Avoid this one at all costs.  [later] It appears the shield I received wasn't a DioFilm but a cheapo one they give with eh DioSkinz. I've asked that they send me a DioFilm for review. We'll see 
 I'm VERY picky about my linguistics books because I've just read too many by hobbyists that turn out to be full of errors.  Unfortunately being an actual linguist doesn't stop the author of this book making sweeping statements that simply aren't factual, or rubbishing statistics because he has a "feeling" that the opposite is true.   He predicts that English will be the only language spoken anywhere in the world in the not-so-distant future, and on what basis? His main "evidence" for this seems to be the fact that Quebec French is adopting English forms of speech.  Absolutely nothing is put forward to justify the conclusion that English will replace French in France, though, or Spanish or Arabic or Chinese in the countries where those languages are spoken.  Yet somehow he arrives at that conclusion anyway.  Dalby also makes shockingly racist comments about the Travelling community in England, and for all his dire warnings about the deaths of languages, offers no practical solutions whatsoever for how to prevent them - except that people should stop spreading English.   An easy enough read for those of us interested in the subject, but unfortunately contributes very little of substance to it 
 Ad hominem is a logical fallacy, you say?  That sounds like something a sexually deviant, financially-incompetent intellectual would say 
 You'd think Michelin, a French company, would write an excellent guide to its home country. You'd be wrong, unless you consider information about accomodation and places to eat to be superfluous, which this guide does.    What does it contain? Lots of brief explanations of every last tourist site in France. In an effort to be inclusive, it has failed to prioritize, resulting in minor attractions being given nearly the same coverage as major ones. Yes, they rate things using their three-star system, but it's just not enough to distinguish the worthwhile from the merely amusing.   The only reason the book merits two stars is the suggested walks provided for various cities.   From now on I'm sticking to Lonely Planet. Their guides may be weighed down by unnecessary PC editorializing, but they give you enough logistical information to find places to eat and sleep. 
 DID/MPD is a psuedo-psychological fad, just like repressed memory therapy, that is not in any way validated by the true Science, Medical, or Psychiatric professions.  Every case of supposed MPD ever studied by any accredited Psychiatrist has been shown to be merely a product of suggestion by a disreputable therapist.    If you wish to read a harrowing story of real abuse survival and not some science fiction rubbish, read A Child Called "It", by Dave Pelzer.  It is simply amazing to me that there are so very many real, documented, verifiable cases of actual extreme mental, physical, and sexual abuse survivors out there, and that NOT ONE OF THE DOCUMENTED REAL CASES DEVELOPED MPD OR DID!  Maybe that's because there is no such thing as DID/MPD, and those people like "Trudi Chase" who claim actual abuse and make up sensational science fiction stories in order to get rich and sell books should be ashamed of themselves.  By the way, it's a well known and highly accepted FACT in the Psychiatrical and Medical community that Sybil was all a lie as well.  Do a search and see what those taped transcripts actually reveal.  Her "therapist", and I use the term in extreme sarcasm, named her alleged personalities and asked her to "let me speak to that part of you that feels that certain way, we'll call that part Helen, ok?"  Educate yourselves.  Read this and enjoy it as a piece of total fiction.  If you want fact, read Dave Pelzer.  
 Yet another album that suffers form the lack of understanding of the work  of Bach.  I have not heard any previous swiched on Bach, and if this is the  style of interpretation of the Music then I will certainly give them a  miss.  The mathematical precision of the work with the relationship between  tones is lost in many sections and the whole seems to have gained a  discordant note that is not appropriate to Bach and his craftings.  The  whole feeling of the music is the same as Walter/Wendy Carlos's previous  works 
 The book is "OK", some years old now and I found a couple of errors. The trivia has a lot of stuff on TV shows and movies that I have never heard of. Nonethe less it was fun looking over from my bedside stan 
 I'd give this movie a negative star if I could.  AVOID this movie. It's terrible. Not one positive thing could be said about this movie 
 I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k-cups. I loved the price. The coffee is wonderful(!), but I hate getting grounds in my coffee! I've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds *under* the filter, so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup--about a 1/2 teaspoon per cup. Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards. 
 This book was published in 1996, however, the information seems like it comes from 1986.  It is full of stereotypes and hacker rumors that any REAL hacker would laugh at.  It might be good if you want the info on search warrants, but computer hardware and software has changed so much that most of this book is irrelevant today 
 This movie was awful. Madeline Stowe deserves better, and Mischa Barton should stick to the O.C Dumb premise gets even more muddled when the mother (spoiler!) finds her daughter, the daughter still behaves like a total brat. I would have left her with the bloodsuckers. 
 First off, Tony Robbins' voice is like nails on a chalk board. There's a real phoniness to it as well as his inflection and false enthusiasm. If you get past all that you're still not much better off. This CD comprises of six separate discs, an hour apiece, that could have been compressed into a 15min pitch. Believe in yourself, try hard, try harder and consistently and constantly never stop trying to improve. That's it!   Robbins has gotten super, super rich tapping into the millions of vulnerable souls out there looking for a purpose. Maybe I'm one of them but I must say I felt thoroughly ripped off having purchased these recordings. I tip my hat to him though, he's got a racket going that will forever provide him an audience until the end of time.  I can't say he's doing anything wrong. I'm just saying he's making a lot of money preying on peoples' weaknesses by selling them tapes and seminars that provide a very short term comfort with no lasting results 
 This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work 
 I could hardly wait to read this latest Dorthey  Martin book.  So I bought the hard cover.  It is so bad I  almost did't finish it.  The murders are never explained.  The characters are all gray and you need a guide to tell them apart.  In the end you think to yourself,"That is it?"  Mrs.  Martin, not your best effort 
 I didn't know that they made music videos this long. If I had known that's all that this was, I would never have watched it. THIS IS A HORRIBLE FILM! SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND AVOID THIS MONSTROSITY! 
 I enjoyed the first 3 books of the Women's Murder Club. Didn't like too much the 4th (of July), but the 5th is just BAD ! What's the plot ? There is no plot ! 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it's even badly written. Don't know if Patterson thinks about writting a 6th, but don't count on me next time  
 Having read 'Price of Temptation' and enjoyed it, I pre-ordered this book, excited about another romantic, boys-love read.  Therefore, it pains me to say how disappointed I was with this novel.    While it still delivered in the sense of romance (as in, there was payoff), and while the author fixed the point of view problem from the previous book, the plotting in this novel was so predictable and ineffectual as to be tedious.  The author had too many themes--architecture, ghost stories, storytelling--none of which connected or were resolved very well at all.  It lent a very messy feel.  The author also posed questions about characters and their motivations and yet left them unanswered.  As a whole, the writing felt rushed and pieced together.  Where the occasional moments of colloquialism in the previous book were forgivable for their infrequence, the extremely modern and loose dialogue in this book stuck out terribly.  The most interesting aspect of the book was the subplot revolving around the coachman.  I wish I could say the main couple had been more intriguing since that's what I read the book for.  The excellent chemistry that the author created between Stephen and Jamie in 'Price of Temptation' was not recreated here between Rob and Dean.  And while I like the occasional use of fragments for effect, they showed up far too much throughout the book--so much, I resigned to see it as writing error and not effect.    I madly recommended 'Price of Temptation' to my fellow slasher friends--and will continue to do so--but that same enthusiasm will not be carried over into the author's second work. 
 steve i heard you are going to be studying in the united kingdom of great britian and northern ireland for the next two years.... something i aspire to do. If you have a moment to sit down and talk, that would be great 
 This dress up trunk is of very poor quality.  All the dress up items are thin, flimsy and poorly made with frayed unfinished hems and edges.  The trunk itself won't last more than 5 minutes, if you can get it to stay  together at all.  Don't waste you time or money!  You and your child will be sorely disappointed 
 I was disappointed in this product.  When I attached it at the cable source it created probles for my broadband connection and living TV set.  I did install it at my TV on the second floor where I was originally having signal deterioration and it worked for awhile.  I would first suggest having your cable company in and "tweak" your cable throughput - it shouldn't cost you anything other than sitting around waiting for a service call.  I no longer have it installed and will resell it on ebay 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 Want even more extreme policies from the radically egalitarian vermin than we've seen evolve within the US over the past century?  Follow the ideas of this turkey and you'll get them!  You can have freedom or you can have this  kind of enforced utopian egalitiarianism--you can't have both.  I'll choose  freedom any time 
 Well, truth be told, I am a die hard Barbara Michaels fan (aka. Elizabeth Peters).  I exausted my Barbara books and decided to switch to one of her Elizabeth Peters novels.  Since I didn't want to get into a whole series like the Peabody series or what not, I picked this book.     What a let down!!!    OK, it kept my intrest and wasen't a total waste of time, but the story was predictable from the middle of the book.  Maybe even the beginning. Normaly when I read one of her books I feverishly tear through the last 20 pages or so.  Yeah, this one contained the quintessential explination and the "wrap up", but there was no basis to it.  I came to the last page and thought  THATS IT, you gotta be kidding me.  
 I purchased this Dictionary for my daughters thinking it was a thorough complete dictionary that would meet all of their needs when searching for a word. I have recently come to learn that this book definetly falls short of a complete dictionary,..as it simply does not contain many words you would find in any other complete dictionary. Several times my children were searching for a word and gave up not being able to find it in the book, so I had to get MY dictionary so they could find the definition! Very disappointing 
 WOW!!!  I used to love these guys when I was in high school and had forgotten about them until recently when I saw this disc in a used bin at a record store.  When I put the disc on I could hardly believe my ears!  The level of musicianship, quality of arrangements, and man oh man, Emanuel Rahiem Leblanc's voice is astounding!!!  I didn't remember what a truly spectacular singer this guy was - an absolute equal of any of the great R&B stars of the 70's or 80's.  To label them a "disco" band only, would be doing a misservice to the group.  Their music skillfully and beautifully fuses soul, funk, doo-wop, and R&B.  I believe it's much more musically substantial than a "disco band" label implies, that's all.   Judging by alot of the feedback here they can apparently still throw down in concert as well.  That's not a surprise.  Listen to the skill all the players in this band possess and you'll see why this band's music is timeless - sounds as good today as 20-30 years ago, and will sound as good 50 years from now.  I sure hope they play Minneapolis soon!! 
 Not only is this rife with errors as other reviewers have mentioned, but it completely glosses over Asian edged weaponry and labels it as "mediocre" and "uninteresting".  The book should not be sold as a guide or as a handbook or as anything short of an incomplete and inaccurate school report on European weaponry 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose. 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 I hated this book! I usually love Coulters work and her heroes, but Anthony was just revolting! The rape, the beating, everything about the way he treated her, including the whole 'I loved your mother, you'll do as the next best thing' just left me wishing that another character (even Edward)would come save poor Cassie from this monstrous man! He just completely degraded her. So what if he loved her - move on, get over it. Personally I see his actions as a deranged stalker, not a man in love. I disagree with all the other reviewers who state that we shouldn't apply modern values to historical romances - hello? If I want realism, I'll read a history book. This is supposed to be fiction! If it was really accurate he probably would have no teeth and smell bad! Plus, we as the readers should identify with the main characters. Cassie's decision to love the man who raped her just left me cold. My kind of heroine would have fought and made him pay (maybe castrated him after beating him thoroughly!) If you like romances - stay away 
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 I don't care how many credentials or degrees or how informative your information is, but if you start to fall asleep every three or four pages or have to read whole sections over because your mind drifts, then you've  missed an essential part of writing and editing. YOU MUST MAKE IT  INTERESTING! I read a half dozen books a month and this read like a text  book, no worse than a text book. It read like a military manual, JUST like  Kirkus reviews says. They were right on target.  Fire your editor and get  someone with a personality to help you write your next book. The only  reason I give it two stars is that the information is there if you can  suffer the writing 
 I purchased an iAudio U2 MP3 player for someone as a gift.  On Amazon, they recommend this case as an accessory.  As already noted by another user, this case does NOT fit the U2 player and I am just re-emphasizing that point.  Do not buy this as an armband for the U2 
 I am an avid reader and I am not sure what to make of the other individuals' assessments of this novel.  I gave it 2 stars because the writing wasn't horible, but I did not see any development in the characters or any compelling reason to become engaged in the story.    Written almost entirely from Lorna's perspective (with the exception of about 5 pages), readers are unable to see any internal dimensions to the other characters.  Even when written from Lorna's perspective, there are no clear dimensions to her character either.  There were attempts to provide depth to personalities, but, in my opinion, ultimately failed.  Instead, I found myself unable to really care what happened to the members of the story. Most people want characters who maintain a level of complexity, whose stories evoke some sort of emotional response.  These characters provided none of these things.  If you want to read a romantic suspense with no romance or suspense in it, then this is a perfect choice.  Even knowing this, I wouldn't get my hopes up. Try a Nora Roberts, Suzanne Brockmann or a Tami Hoag for characters with depth and a story that compells you to not put the book down.  This book just wasn't it 
 Thriller is the ONE song I like by Micheal Jackson(not counting the Jackson 5) I saw/heard it in 13 going on 30 and thought it had a good beat to it. and when that dude starts talking near the end, some of it goes like this:  Must stand and face the hounds of hell, and rot inside a corpse's shell  Now would you really want some 6 year old listening to that? I bet they don't even have that talking part at the end. Oh, and I would love to know exactly how they got permission from Micheal Jackson : 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 More anti-hero "iconoclast" post modernism that has nothing much to say or nothing new to add. This is like diluted Henry Miller with less wit and style 
 I was disappointed in the contents of the book.  Although some of the information was helpful, each chapter ended with how difficult it was to be an independent IT Consultant.  Also, the book is written from a UK perspective and does not focus on many aspects that are specific to the US, including new legislation (SOX) or sub-contracting 
 Berkhof's work itself is an essential document for the thinking Christian. With much of what one sees going on today, this is put into even sharper relief. This particular publishing is the `New Combined Edition', giving you a lengthy introductory work as well as the work proper, topping it out at over 900 pp. But the publishers cast it in a small book format. You have to forcibly hold the book open to read it. I would suggest getting the The Banner of Truth edition but I don't know if it will include the introduction 
 i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.  
 I bought this book hoping for clues to help my high school students.  It didn't happen. This book would be a good choice for college instructors.  
 This review is for the audio edition. No stars is the true rating of a silly conversation with an old guy who cannot talk. The level of the meanings and ideas it is less than of a child in the first classes of elementary school. I feel very stupid i paid money for this garbage 
 I didn't think this book was particularly strong.  It has writings from academics whom I totally admire.  And I understand why people would study gayness as it relates to 1960s popular culture.  Still, this book has very little about Warhol and his sexuality in it.  A person is better off reading a biography of Warhol, especially those written by the people who knew him personally.  This was quite an unimpressive anthology 
 This is a reasonably fun light read which would have improved if it had been edited.  As with many American popular science books, the first third is perhaps worth reading if you're fast, the second third is barely OK, and the last third seems to have gone directly from a first draft written in a word processor to the printed page.   The premise is entertaining- that human intelligence might have evolved as a sexual display - but it's not well supported by evidence. To be fair, the author points this out occasionally in the first third of the book.   I only save books I might like to read or refer to again. This one ended up directly in the wastebasket. 
 This book is really reserved for pattern's fans, because material inside is essentially focused on processes patterns, and design materials are expressed in a textual way. Anyway, some ideas are good to be kept aside,  but amount of such ideas don't justify the book size 
 This book is way too much, in almost every respect. I say almost because there is one respect lacking, which is Quality, with a Robert Pirsig capital Q. There are plenty of pages, words, descriptions, drugs, inane ramblings, and just about anything else under the sun you might identify with a book that is, at last count, going absolutely nowhere in a very verbose way. This is the epitome of not having much to say and taking a long, long time to say it. Very late 20th Century America, to be sure.   I read 200 pages, give or take. These 200 pages represent roughly the equivalent of most full-length novels, given that the average DFW page contains about 500 words. The thing still had 800 pages to go, plus footnotes. In a world teeming with books screaming to be read, a 1000 page, small-print book with little direction has no room to stand in my world, let along sit on my lap and take up valuable reading time. As it is, I wasted far too much time reaching page 200, a task I deem Herculean yet foolish at the same time. Why did I not stop at 100? I cannot answer that question.  The book appeared to be headed for points unidentified at around, oh..let's say page 2. I stuck it out, opting to see if it would eventually go somewhere. That's like standing next to a dead elephant wondering if that, too, will go somewhere. I assure you that no amount of time spent staring at its lack of movement will make a difference. Do yourself a favor and walk away from this particular elephant, lest you become irate and throw it at someone. This thing could really hurt a person if you were inclined to do something like that.  I obviously don't have anything good to say about this book. In trying to understand people who might like it (since it does have a 4 star average rating after all), I can only venture a guess that young, not-especially well-traveled readers do? Some lost segment of Generation X which never woke up to realize that the world is more than Dave Eggers and Douglass Coupland? Blind People?  A friend of mine once reviewed Dave Navarro's album Trust No One by saying that the potential buyer would be wise to heed the title of the album. Likewise, you can use this same sentiment when standing in the bookstore contemplating the purchase of Infinite Jest, because in the end, you'll wonder if the joke is on you 
 This book has a lot of useful information about puppy development and personality - but it recommends the choke-chain leash-correction training approach, which has been abandoned by many dog trainers. Setting up situations so the puppy gets it right and is then rewarded is much more humane than jerking the poor little one around 
 The premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.   I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum 
 This could have been one of the best films of the 80's. All of the components are there. Ford gives the best acting of his career. The production is elegant and holds up as often breathtaking even by today's standards. Two things however really bring this movie down.   The major negative here I believe is Polanski's insistence on starring Emmanuelle Seigner. This is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen grace a film, but it is the understatement of the year to say that she can't act at all. In fact, I think that she might have just about turned in the worst acting performance I have ever seen in this film and it totally destroys Ford's performance. When the film was over I thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really two halves here. The first half is dynamite; the second with Seigner is a totally different beast, your average stupid kid thriller. Watch this film and dare contradict my statement here. Get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not meant for this part. It's so bad that  Ford fades into the background in any scene that she was also in.  OK, the second negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up. There is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where Ford and Seigner would be time and time again. It really ruins what could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot. They were never needed and muddle an otherwise great story.  I am really kind of mad with Polanski here. He destroyed what could have been one of the better films he has made. And this statement comes from one who worships the ground Polanski walks on. 
 The advice in this book is not bad, but it is very simplistic and there is nothing new here.  If you have listened to any program on retirement or read any recent magazine article on the topic, everthing here will be familiar.  You can expect to live longer, work longer and should plan in a holistic way for your retirement to provide for financial, spiritual, emotional and physical well-being.  Other than advising diversification and spending less than you earn, Ruth offers no specific financial advice.  The book is very short and repetitive and typographical errors are irritating.  If you make the same mistake as I did and buy this text, you will be helping Ruth's retirement plan much more than your own 
 Don't EVEN bother buying this book.  If you can avoid the snores with all the medical mumbo-jumbo, maybe this book is for you.  Bottom line is: don't fret about aging because it's going to happen to you and eat right, exercise and take your vitamins.  So what else is new?  P.S.  Dr. Weil writes that there are no anti-aging remedies yet he advertises Origins mushroom face creams--hmmm.... 
 I watched this movie with my 7 year old daughter, and regretted it about 10 minutes in.  After reading Queen Bees & Wannabees, I can't help but despair whenever I look over the precipice and get a glimpse into teen girl world.    In Barbie's envisioning of this world the central theme is to "be yourself", but in the end they only seek themselves in a banal existence of dress shopping, chasing each others' boyfriends, inventing lip gloss disguised as a highlighter, deciding what to wear to an afternoon of watching cute boys practice football, and halfheartedly pursuing a career as a rock star.  While I realize that this is teenage girl reality, is this what needs to be held up to pre-teens as a personality blueprint?  The popular girls look exactly like the unpopular girls, so it's not like the criteria for who gets to set foot on the "popular lawn" is really clear, other than you have to be mean-spirited and backstabbing.  But at least they somewhat captured the spirit of what it's like to be on the outside looking in.  Of course, there's the "magic diary" aspect of the story, which seemed the only tie to the "other" Barbie world (Fairytopia, Mermadia, et all).  I realized then what I was really watching...a marketing cry for help from Mattel.  The target demo for Barbie has shrunk to 3-6 year old girls, and they're trying desperately to expand back into the 7-11 range that other brands like Bratz are chipping away at.  I promptly dumped all Mattel stock from my 401k. 
 1st unit had bad logic board and died after about 1 week of use. Next one the power supply died within 1 month. 3rd unit had bad paper feeder. 4th unit same bad paper feeder problems but couple weeks after warranty ended and HP would not replace despite same problem they "fixed" earlier. Drivers are junk and buggy. In contrast we have a Canon All-in-One unit over a year with zero problems and a Canon printer about 2-3 years with no problems. Stay away from this HP (in fact all HP units) as it will be a pain dealing with the repair issues. My son also had a HP All-in-One that was replaced 3 times in 4 months. He finally ended up selling the replacement unit he received and buying a Canon All-in-one. All in all, 7 replacement units within 1 year between the 2 HP units in our home. Junk! Junk! Junk 
 Even though originally titled, "Andy Warhol's Dracula", this film had very little to do with Andy Warhol. Udo Kier plays a count visitng Italy to satisfy his "special diet", i.e. "virgin blood." Though the royal family's daughters seem promising, Joe Dellesandro (who uses the Andy Warhol style of "non acting")is busy making them ineligible for the Count's requirements. The count's reaction to non virgin blood (in repeat scenes) has to be among the grossest scenes in film, next to the end of Pink Flamingos. Other than that, the movie wanders, the dialogue is dull, the political conflicts unnecesary (remember this was the 70's) and parts of it are closer to soft core porn or badly acted costume drama than horror. Though not as amazingly awful as "Sins of the Fleshapoids" or Ed Wood (who has a certain charm) Blood for Dracula will leave you scratching your head one moment and then turning it away from the screen the next 
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 Great title! Fantastic cover! If only the actual story had lived up to the hype. I love the Realms, amd a huge fan of Paul Kemp, R.A. Salvatore and a handful of other authors who breathe life into this world. I honestly went into this title anticipating great things... which NEVER happened. I did finish it, if for no other reason than I knew with a premise that cool it had to get better. It never did.  Do yourself a huge favor and pass on this one. Mr. Kemp or Mr. Salvatore should have a new book out soon.. 
 Based on an extensive research project this book promises a lot but delivers nothing. The first thing that you have to recognize is that there is hardly any structure at all. Repitions abound without adding any value. The style of writing is close to unbearable - they could have put the contents into a fourth of the pages. The cases are sketchy at best; they claim to offer best practices but are nothing new. The book tries to look into the future and puts forward a wildly speculative view of what the authors think lies ahead; again they do not offer a vision but describe the status quo in future tense. For people who like real satire I recommend Moody's Harley Davidson poem! Summary: Only recommended for those who need to own every book on the subject.. 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 I bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion, however, the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it doesn't seem to go with anything including jeans. The comfort level is ok, not spectacular. In reality I don't think this shoe lives up to the Steve Madden name. I can't recommend this shoe 
 A long, stupid and boring story that you MUST read and memorize at college for quiz tests. I still wonder how studying this most unimportant account of a most unimportant guy is going to help me become a better Mechanical Engineer 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 of all the movies i have seen in this catergory this movie was dissapointing to me. poor acting and hard to understand dialoge.  would get a refund if you were in australia. but it is too much hassle to poste back overseas. and it could get lost in the mail. debr 
 As the parent of a child with a disability, I wanted to like this book more than I did. I appreciate Ms. Buchman's candor about all the events in her life and am glad that it has helped some parents. However, I could not relate to most of what she wrote.   Most parents of kids with disabilities don't have the extreme resources that she has, including live in nannies, access to training programs across the country, expensive private schools, whatever specialists, psychologists, etc America can offer and more. Plus if you're more in tune with your kids, more engaged with them and not emotionally closed off, you might find little in common with a lot of her personal struggles with her kids and husband. I was glad to read that she worked on those issues, but again, I could not relate.   Perhaps it has just come easier to me to not bottle in my feelings about my son's disability at least in front of my own family, and I have always felt strongly about being open and honest in a caring way with my other children, not being an emotionally distant family with pink elephants in the room.    I also have always been a type A overachiever, and yes it has been with some pain that I had to shelve the supermom within me to instead slow down and focus on my special needs family, but I just couldn't relate to her behavior. I also think, like another reviewer wrote, that the things she wrote don't make sense - the crazy hours she and her husband both work, plus constant travelling for work, just does not jive with all the "family time" and long weekend mornings and weeknight dinners she claims to have with her kids. The rosy colored glasses I think she's viewing her kids' childhood with may lead some readers to feel guilty unfairly. Some people may like this book, but I am glad I got it from the library instead of buying it 
 Janet Evanovich is my absolute all time favorite author, which is why I'm heartbroken over this book. I have never read an Evanovich book I didn't like until now. I literally finished the book only because Janet wrote it.   The book pretty much goes like this: steal a hauler, Beans is kidnapped, follow people around, get Beans back, follow more people around, Gobbles is kidnapped, follow some more people around, Hooker is kidnapped(my favorite part, who likes a cheater!), follow even more people around, etc, etc... Wish I had a nickel for every car they tailed in this book. I also agree with the other reviewers, Beans the dog got on my nerves pretty quick.   I'm still a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series. I can't wait for the next Plum book in January. I just wish Janet would have spent her time working on the next Plum novel instead of wasting everyones time with Motor Mouth.  
 the annoying lackluster characters or the insipidness of the "novel" as a whole?  It makes one wonder what the author actually *did* while at Oxford.  And the positive comments from Wintour and various media outlets are laughable and fairly baffling as you read the drivel.  Save your brain and choose something else...anything else. ; 
 Kurt's journals were a private thing, not something that should have been mass marketted by corporate America to kids...All that they did was exploit Kurts deepest thoughts to make a quick buck off of angst filled youth...The company who published this book can rot. And the people who buy it, I question. No matter how curious you are these were the inner thoughts of an artist that should have never seen the light of day 
 Not even Jessica Alba can save this really bad movie. Compared to other dance movies like Flashdance, Dirty Dancing, Footloose, Grease, etc. this is by war the worst. This one is not a keeper. Not recommended. If you want to see Jessica then get "Into the Blue" which is much better and that is recommended. 
 I got this about a year ago. People complain they can't hear me unless I talk really loud.  The other phone in our house (also a panasonic, but a kx-tg2258s) didn't have this problem, but it just died and displays an 'e3' error code. I am finished buying panasonic phones, and for other products I buy, I will consider other brands first 
 I did not like the book Adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters. I also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father I shall bla bla bla 
 Mark's clever as a wizard but just as cold.  For fans of technique only, those to whom concerns for the characters don't matter, but being post-modern and just plain edgy is as good as it gets.  Steve Vai plays more notes than Mozart, but never played a memorable tune.  Costello's so wound up in "being a writer" that he forgot to make his readers give a damn.  Maybe next time, because a good book's probably in there somewhere 
 This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book. 
 I was disappointed with this book. Rather than a behind the scenes look into the strategy and excitement of today's dealmaking, it is a look into the past (poorly edited)of several VCs really not relating to their current successes. Better historical perspective in "The Big Deal" by Wasserstein and better strategy in "Winning at M&A" by Clemente and Greenspan 
 If a person constantly predicts a bear market over a period of years, eventually he will prove right, since, as we all know, bull markets do not last forever, and bear markets are regular features of the stock market landscape. However, it is not enough simply to predict a bear market, one must predict a bear market at the right time. A prediction of a bear market during the early and mid 1990s (and there were many) would not be particularly helpful, since the bull continued to 2000. The same applies here to Mauldin. Mauldin predicted a bear market in 2004. He was wrong. A consistent bull market lasted from early 2003 until early 2006. The market has turned down since May of 2006, but as of this writing (Aug. 3), the market is still up significantly for the year. If you listened to John Mauldin's advice, you would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005, and early 2006, especially in small-mid caps and foreign markets.   According to John Mauldin, bull and bear markets always last approximately 7-15 years. The facts do not support this conclusion. A bear market lasts for as long as it continues, and no longer. The bear market of 2000-2003 lasted only 3 years. Now according to Mauldin, the bull market of 2003-2006 is simply a "bear rally." But three plus years of positive returns cannot be so easily dismissed. In practical terms, for investors, you simply cannot afford to sit out a market rally like the 2003-2006 one.    Study after study has shown that the best way to minimize your risk and maximize your returns is to diversify, invest for the long run, and choose your mutual funds and stocks with great care after substantial research. One should not "buy and hold" blindly, but it's been proved that if your investment horizon is 9 years or more, a diversified portfolio of stocks will consistently outperform bonds. Furthermore, it's impossible to time the market successfully on any kind of consistent basis.   Mauldin is in the hedge fund business; hedge funds are designed to produce positive returns during bear markets. So it is in his personal interest to convince people that a bear market is coming. Hedge funds are limited to people with over a million dollars, so they are not exactly a viable solution for average investors. In addition, hedge funds are not the cure-all that Mauldin suggests. In fact, many hedge funds lose money and go out of business. They are, in fact, extremely risky investments, despite Mauldin's claims.   Mauldin believes in a deep value approach to stock picking, which I happen to agree with. Value stocks have lower volatility and tend to outperform the market in the long run. However, they don't do as well as growth stocks during bull markets, as several value fund managers learned during the late 1990s, some of whom even lost their jobs.   The argument Mauldin makes for a coming recession is pretty persuasive although not original. Trade deficits, budget deficits, an aging population, pension and medicare obligations; these all point to increased inflation (the least painful and only politically acceptable way to pay off our obligations) leading to recession and depressed stock prices. With the current market and economic conditions (Aug. 2006), it's time to think about some defensive investment choices: value and high-dividend stocks, and bonds. But we are not in a recession yet, and it's not inevitable. As Mauldin points out, quoting Greenspan, the market is so large and complex that it's essentially impossible to make accurate predictions. And the market is so efficient, that if it were possible to predict the future by any means, that information would be immediately and permanently discounted. 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 I wish I could give this book less than a star because even 1 star is too generous for this book. The first chapter is quick to cite the important points in working a room (points that you can learn from just any other book on conversation) and the rest is just nonsensical repetition of the same facts again and again. All in all, the book has too many flaws and a too little new material to be of any value 
 I still like the book, but new teachers should be careful when reading it.  Several people have written that Esquith has left out some important details.  For instance, what kind of population is this really?  There are no African-Americans on the cover, or I don't know if they are even directly mentioned in the book.  I don't believe race has any direct bearing on how well a student will do, but a white male compared to a black female teaching African-Americans in a "jungle" will have quite a different experience than a white male like Rafe teaching immigrants or Americans of immigrant families.  Also, are most of these students from single-parent households?  And when immigrants come to the U.S., don't many of them already have somewhat of a work ethic instilled in them due to their history and culture?  Otherwise, I think it is a good book and I enjoyed it very much 
 I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it 
 We read this book in ILA and it was so boring! The character had no emotions and it was very slow moving with no excitement. I almost fell asleep. DON'T READ THIS BOO 
  	Considering his string of career disappointments since the demise of "Lois & Clark" you have to wonder why in the world Dean Cain would ever have agreed to star in "Lost," a 2004 movie by Darren Lemke now available on DVD.  The only possible answer that comes to mind is that Cain figured that if people could suspend their disbelieve enough to not see through Clark Kent's disguise, then maybe they could also suspend it enough not see through this failed and pointless movie.  	The set-up here (one can't actually call it a plot) is that Cain is a bank VP who arranges to have his own bank robbed, and then double-crosses the bad guys who stage the hold-up on his behalf.  It is a premise that might have gone far in the hands of an accomplished screenwriter.  Unfortunately, Lemke acted as his own scribe and apparently never showed the script to a soul until the cameras started rolling, so one can only surmise that there was no one else there to tell him that he had gone way, way, way, off course.  	The tension in the film is supposed to come from three facts: #1, Cain's character, Jeremy Stanton, is lost somewhere in the Nevada desert trying to make his escape from what he initially believes to be the perfect crime.  The second alleged tension point is the fact that not only his erstwhile accomplices, but everyone else west of the Mississippi have quickly figured out that Stanton is the brains behind both the robbery and the double-cross.  The third and final bit of suspense is intended to come from the fact that Stanton's cheated former partners are hot on his trail.    Regrettably, not one of these subplots really works.  Much is made in the screenplay of the fact that Stanton's map is out of date and that roads along his intended route are closed, flooded or no longer in existence.  But by the third time his On-Star proxy telephone navigation aide has informed him that the road he is on actually has a different name than the one on the map, the device has worn dangerously thin.  In point of fact, it is probably impossible to truly get as lost anywhere in North America as Stanton is portrayed as being in the film. But this impossibility is only one of several that haunt this improbable tale.  A few other include Stanton's apparent belief that his disappearance will go unnoticed after the robbery; the fact that he is portrayed as not having ever scouted out his escape route, and therefore has no idea at all of where he is going; the fact that his bad guy accomplices somehow unerringly get from the scene of the crime to the exact same roads to nowhere he is unintentionally traveling, and do so quickly enough to literally be right on his tail; and the fact that these same accomplices not only figure out EXACTLY how to trap him, but are successful in doing so. The script even has Cain reprising one of his old Superman stunts, unbelievably successful in spite of the absence of costume or cape.  To spice up Stanton's journey, Director Lemke tosses in an ominous cop on trash patrol, a catatonic old lady with a truck to sell, a spooky toothless preacher, moral lessons from one of AAA's lesser known competitors, and perhaps the worst motivational speaker to ever sell an audio tape.  None of it helps.   This film is aptly titled, for the movie, like the Stanton character himself, speeds 90 miles an hour down a dead end road, and it is quite possible to sense Cain sharing Stanton's grudging relief when the whole thing comes to a predictable and bad end. "At least it's over," both the actor and his character must have been thinking.  It is only too bad that neither Cain nor his alter ego ever noticed the cavernous holes in this awful story; perhaps he could have driven through one, gotten clean away and against the odds lived happily ever after. 
 I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.  The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.  Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .  The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.  This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.  Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man.   In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.  - CV Ric 
 First off anyone that knows who Kenneth Hagin is, probably has been part of a church that acknowledges him as an influence or that Rheima is some kind of parent church for their local church cleverly disguised as the type depicted as in the Word/Faith movement.    Many of the attributes Hagin points out that are for the Believer to take authority over Satan is nothing more than blasphemous.  He uses facts that are blatantly lies, heretical, and preposterous.  Here is an actual quote from page 19-20, "... the average Christian has more faith in Satan's authority and power than in God's!"  Which Christians has he polled for this?  From what denominations?  Perhaps within the Pentecostal/ Charismatic realm, which then becomes understandable.  Most Bible believing Christians I know, realize that God is sovereign and that alone shows God has exponentially more authority than the defeated satan can even ignorantly believe.  My heart goes out for those seeking truth, but teachings from Hagin and the rest of the Word/Faith movement can do anything but build faith.  The faith they teach isn't faith in God, but faith in faith and that is utterly an idol and God will rebuke those that claim to know Him.  I'd feel sorry for those that on Judgment day say to the Lord that they have healed many in Jesus name by laying on of hands and speaking in unknown tongues as well as dancing and laughing and making animal noises and other strange gutteral sounds all in the "name of Jesus", and you can probably guess what Jesus will say next as well as not seeing your name in the Book of Life.  The time is short and Jesus will be returning soon.  Please check your heart and most importantly check that the church you may have been a part of for several years of through family generations are actually teaching thew Word of God and not adding or subtracting to/from it like this word/faith charlatans are doing.  I can't stress how dangerous this is as I see this mentality of word/faith creeping in like a weed even in many fundamental type churches which makes clear the end times are arriving soon.  Be careful and God bless you and pray that God unveils to you the truth of His word and that the Holy Spirit guide you to a Biblically sound church with no heretical or blasphemous elements.  Even you Pentecostals know the story of one drop of arsenic in a gallon or 5 gallons of water.  
 See what happens when the author's friends write the reviews? After all the glowing raves given "Postwar," I spent fancy money on it, and in the end, I came to agree with the only negative review of it I saw, in The Economist. You are misled by the acuity of the first chapter, in which Judt explains how much the current peace of Europe derives from the severe ethnic cleansing that took place there during and just after World War II--a fascinating point quite new to me. But after that, over 830 pages, Judt tries to explain everything and gets to the bottom of nothing. What did Margaret Thatcher really accomplish for England? I still don't know, though I learned a lot on my way to not knowing. This was the failing cited by The Economist reviewer, too. If you want a history of the war's aftermath in Europe (though only up to the mid-fifties) try "1945" by Gregor Dallas: distilled, acute, clear, concrete, fresh, and compelling. Maybe Dallas needs to hustle academic insiders as well as Judt does, for unlike Judt, Dallas actually delivers the goods and deserves the credit wasted on Judt. 
 The article that Mrs. Montano refers to in her review actually says that there is overwhleming evidence that Chief Seattle did not make this speech!  You can google it up yourself and see. Wanting to believe something does not make it so 
 As below, this book does not include birds in the other peterson guides.  Far better books are out there 
 I'm not surprised that the author is described as a "television writer"- this book is a collectio of short, meaningless facts and falsehoods that do little for the understanding of one of the most important events in American history. His mistakes are mostly a matter of his lack of understanding of the wider history and context of the war; for example, he wries about Confederate "desertions", but the CSA didn't conscript of enlist soliders the way the North did. Instead, soldiers would come and go, leaving for a while to (say) bring in the harvest and then returning to the army. Typos, factual errors and just plain lack of understanding abound- just like television 
 This is a very poorly written book. There is no coherence to it, no direction, no real point 
 I found this to be a really annoying, and - in the audio format - annoyingly-told story. It sounds like a screenplay, with symbolism, mystery, and trivia that are so mediocre... how best to describe it? Here, read the book if you think this is fascinating: the orange is a symbol of the divine feminine because it's round like a mother's womb. If that doesn't blow you away, read something else.   The two leads are so stereotypical, it hurts. Lastly, the guy reading the audio version puts on these heavy nasal French accents that actually impede understanding of what's being said, and then he has French people speak to each other in these accents - way overdone. Then, layered on that, they are explaining things to each other that any French person would already know (cle de voute, for example) for the reader's benefit.   Taking in the many supposedly intriguing objects and situations in this book was exactly like watching the movie Van Helsing for me - I'm watching that thinking "a werewolf, and vampires? and frankenstein? and hot chicks? why, it's got everything! what next?" Short attention span theater. The fact that this book is so popular makes me sad 
 This book tries to link together everything in Stephen King's books.  Sometimes it tries too hard.  Like finding a character name from one book simply mentioned in another.  Not too mind-blowing.  Some of the interconnections were intersting, but overall nothing to write home (or a book) about 
 There are many much better slow cooker cookbooks out there...Mabel Hoffman's for example.  I made two recipes from this book and both were barely edible.  The combination of ingredients in most of the recipies are enough to prompt a gag reflex!  ... Do yourself a favor and look into buying a different slow cooker book 
 Useful for traveling and basic translation purposes, but very limited in word meanings. This is particularly true for the English to French section, where a word will often have only one corresponding meaning 
 I was given "Videohound's Horror Show" as a Christmas present the past year, and just finished working my through it the other day. I have to say I was really disappointed overall. As other reviewers point out so well, why are "Alice in Wonderland", "Platoon" and "Wizard of Oz" included here? There are so many movies that may have horrific elements in them, but they are still not horror films. Even if you take those films out of the mix, the biggest issue I have with Mike Mayo's work, is that he is approaching and reviewing these films with a main-stream sensability. Mayo's approach to most of the films presented in this book are written as if for a non-horror fan audience. Most horror fans know what to expect with a "Halloween" sequel, we aren't looking for quality film making like "Shakespeare in Love". We just need to know if Michael is creepy, what's the body count, and are the special effects worth the ticket price? I was hoping to find some "new" titles here, but to be honest even a casual fan of the genre, will be pretty familiar with the movies listed here.  The one aspect of this book that I did like, was that Mayo was not into giving away spoilers. Rarely does Mayo spill the beans about any twists or shocks pertaining to any of the films he reviews, and that was a breath of fresh air.  As a horror fan I would recommend you check out "Legacy of Blood: a Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies" by Jim Harper instead of VideoHound's offering. "Legacy" doesn't cover nearly as many films, and sticks just to the Slasher genre, but it is well written, and features reviews written for horror fans by a horror fan. Jim Harper "gets" horror, and knows what a horror fan wants 
 Let me start by stating that im a 24 year old university educated individual.  This book was thrusted into my face and forced into my brain when i was in forth grade.  It was by far the most driest and boring book i've ever read at that point in my life...and continue to be so until college.  Now, i dont remember anything at all about this book other than the fact it was about some boy writing letters to some man; but the fact that i dont remember anything gives you an idea at how little i stimulted.  Till this day, im reluctant to even bother to re-read this book and give it another chance.  I've been scarred for life.  I have no doubt that this books contains a lot of substance and insightful tales, but the thought of reading some poor pathetic boy's letters causes me to shriver.  If i would have to chose any book of my childhood that discouraged me from reading more, it would have to be this.  PLease spare your child/student from the tortures of this book.  Maybe once they've grown mentally and have the capacity and patience to understand it, it would be a great book.  But at such a young age, its a horrible read.  I noticed that this book recieved some high marks from young readers; for some reason i feel that those ratings may be incorrect and the young children's opinions may have been "clouded".  Do you teacher's know no shame?  
 Don't be fooled by the perfect cut of the countries on the box cover. I bought this for my [...] thinking the pieces were actually in the shape of the countries and it would be a good learning tool. Not quite. Some were. Most were not. Some countries were so small they were difficult to read. This will be in our next garage sale. Springbok puzzles are still the best 
 To be honest, I've never been that impressed by the kind of programmes the History Channel puts out - too much emphasis on entertainment and not enpough on decent research, historical accuracy, etc.  So it was no big surprise to find this programme seriously "skewed", as a previous reviewer put it.  This is a thoroughly lacklustre product which suffers from the same shortcomings that I already mentioned.  So rather than waste my time and yours reviewing something that isn't worth watching in the first place I just want to direct your attention to "The Real Da Vinci Code" released in May this year (2006). It still isn't the definitive investigation - you'd need more than a couple of hours to cover all the relevant topics, but it has this offering seriously outclassed in every department- even as straight forward entertainment! 
 Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry 
 As Mr. Lincoln once said, " People who like this sort of thing, will find this the sort of thing they like".  My wife, a fan and American Studies major, loved it. I on the other hand found myself wishing that Patrick O'Brian were still alive.  The first chapter is the best section of the book, but was basically meaningless since I do not believe that baseball embodies Mystical American Goodness.  You will like this book if you are a Delillo fan, or believe that the literary critics know something that you don't.  If not, life is short, find something else 
 Is there a risk that following the events of September 11, 2001, the United States may be overreacting, or acting in an improper or counterproductive manner?  Of course.  We need some thoughtful, objective, and constructive criticism.  And some good advice.  But this book doesn't provide it.  I'll mention just a couple of areas where I think the book disqualifies itself from being helpful.  The first is in the discussion of a racist American backlash against innocent Arab Americans.  And a backlash against dissent from American policies.  That's something that I do not take lightly.  And what this book says will, in my opinion, make matters worse.  Mahajan says "the backlash against dissent got so bad that even one tenured professor lost his job because of it."  Um, who lost his job?  Sami al-Arian!  For those of you who don't know who he is, he's on trial for having been the North American leader of Islamic Jihad, a notorious terrorist group that has claimed "credit" for attacks that have killed at least 100 people in Israel and the disputed West Bank territories.  He's also accused of having played a crucial role in writing the Jihad's constitution, raising money for the Jihad, helping other Jihad leaders enter the United States, and planning an extensive espionage operation.  If there were just one person the United States ought to have been firing from their position, arresting, and putting on trial, it might well have been al-Arian.  He's not the right person to try to defend by claiming anti-Arab racism!  He's not the right person to try to defend by implying that his only crime was that "in his youth" he made "an intemperate speech."    Well, let's see how this book deals with the Levant.  The author says that the Oslo process was about the Arabs "bargaining away part of their internationally recognized rights to the whole of the occupied territories."  Unfortunately for him, there is no such right to all of the disputed West Bank.  Nor is there even a right to ethnically cleanse all Jews (or Arabs) who might wind up on the "wrong" side of the Israeli border.    You can give constructive advice on how to deal with terrorism.  Or you can support terrorism and taunt its victims.  But you can't do both.  And this book is defending the bad guys. 
 A friend of ours, Guy Gilbert, recommended this film as the "funniest I have ever seen"... it wasn't. There are good moments but not many. My suggestion to Guy was to watch 'Sean of the Dead' and come back to me.. 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 Right from the beginning!!!!!!!Horvath  checks his buddys  house after he disappears and has to CHAMBER a round in his S&W. No trained operative or law enforcement officer carries a weapon with an empty chamber. He also, while checking out the property, describes several cars in the area. All of a sudden he alludes to a FORD. Never mentioned it before...where did the Ford come from....or did he mean the Navigator that he previously referred to as a Lincoln. And then.......the one that broke the camels back.....after being captured in Lawlors house and having his equipment evaluated...........no more S&W but now a Sig 40!!!!!!!!!!  Amateur writing!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Greg 35 year police vet 
 I read the enthusiatic reviews before buying this cookbook.  I was disappointed.  First of all, the recipes are very difficult and time-consuming. It would help to have a staff of kitchen help to do all the required prep. Secondly, the presentation is lacking. But the worst problem of all is the exotic ingredients called for.  It seems that every other recipe requires "kombu" which is apparently some kind of seaweed.  I searched high and low and checked out every oriental market in town, to no avail.  Nobody knew what I was talking about!  I still don't know what kombu is.  Similarly, many other ingredients are generally unavailable.  Maybe these things would be easier to find on the West Coast where there is a large Asian population, but you just can't get them in Texas.  All that said, I did have some very delicious results on the "Acorn Squash stuffed with sweet rice."  I only had to make a few substitutions.. 
 I fell in love I guess with the radio edits. When the CD came out and I purchased it, I blindly thought this was what I would be getting. But to my surprise, I ended up getting quite a bit of RAP mixed in with the songs that to me completely ruined them all.  I threw the CD in the trash, and have learned my lesson with purchasing any future PCD audio 
 I bought this after experiencing McGraw-Hill's SAT I book. It was comprehensive and effective, yet not boring. However, this guide is not only brief and anemic in actual content, I found myself asleep several times while reading it. The websites at the back of the book are not only inaccurate, but may actually be fake. Being a computer nerd, I found no indication that any of the websites HAD ever existed (with the exception of the College Board site); this book was published in 2002, why is there no indication of some of these sites in a search engine cache, links off some other site, etc? There isn't even any indication that any of these sites are planned for the future: absolutely none are registered web domains. Furthermore, the strategies for the multiple choice are VERY basic common sense. A whole page is spent on the concept of elimination of answers that aren't correct. The ONLY redeeming factor is a slight review on rhetorical strategies that actually aided me in the DBQ.  Do yourself a favor: save your money and find some other review for the English Language test. Ironically, the McGraw-Hill guide to the AP English Essay is an excellent guide to writing in general and even includes a section on writing a college admissions essay 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 If you've never read anything about auras, this one would be okay as a primer.  However, there was really nothing new or profound - sorry to say.  My feeling throughout was that the author was trying to make a fast buck by using the Cayce name.  Not worth the 3 or 4 bucks 
 I've tried four recipes so far and only one turned out good.  I'm an experienced baker and have never had this many flops from one book.  Polka dot Minicakes came out awful, the glaze was way too sweet and would not spread as pictured.  The Sweet cheese puffs were just so-so. The Dutch Chocolate Minicakes were excellent.  The Lemon-laced gingersnaps were passable, not great; I have a much better recipe. I also was disappointed in the lack of photos.  I'm now not eager to try any other recipes from this book.  Sometimes I think authors leave out something so you won't get their secrets? 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
  From a guy's perspective it was boring but from a reader's perspective it was an Ok book. Im not that much of a fan about the Newberry books i just read all kinds of books. i really don't care what kinds of books I read. 
 I had hoped to use this book in my high-school history class but found that it does little in terms of imparting a solid sense of what life was like in ancient Rome.  The mystery portion is okay, but my real disappointment stems from the weakness of the historical contextualization 
 If you want a dry outline of the Roman Empire from village to Empire, followed by a rather cursory treatment of Rome's collapse, this book is for you.  This book is also for you if have sleeping issues, and is the kind of book that made me hate history and the liberal arts when I was a smug physics major.  This tome is also filled with far too many spelling typos.  Alex Alaniz  1. Please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book: Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients.  2. I have REVIEWED many books from undergraduate to graduate in: PHYSICS, MATH, ECONOMETRICS, and HISTORY among other areas 
 The title IS very deceptive. I bought the book thinking it was going to help me see life diffrently, it didnt. The author seems to be using the word "God" to get the attention of a christian audience and thats about all. Relates  "god winks" to divorce, and walking out of a marriage. Last time I checked God wasnt a proponet of those things. The author uses these as examples to reprsent a change in life that God is promoting.. The book does have u think about conicidences a little more, and might have u think more deeply into them, but thats about all. I would NOT reccomend this book to a new christian or a struggling christian. It takes all the focus onto the individual and not God. The only thing good about the book is that it is a quick read, and offers interesting stories every now and then. Beware..dont be fooled 
 The book is trite, boring and difficult to read. Poorly worded exercise questions make the book unbearable. The ideas are difficult to understand. Perhaps, a good editor could have saved the book. Or, any editor for that matter.  
 While the born again crowd will no doubt love this book, those who respect cultural and religious diversity will be appalled 
 Chasteen's book is a Marxian historiography.  One of the interesting things about books like Chasteen's is that the reader does not immediately realize, and sometimes never does, that the author has an agenda that goes beyond documenting history; and I think it is important that Born in Blood and Fire is identified as a Marxian viewpoint.  The author frequently asserts his opinion, matter-of-factly. Chasteen's disdain of liberalization and capitalism makes it very clear that he is positing Latin America would have been better off without these modern advents.  Of course, this is only his point of view, but in the context of this book, a textbook, students should be aware that his opinions are not "A Concise History of Latin America."  Agree or disagree, this book must be read critically, not swallowed whole.   	Reading about Mexican liberalization from Chasteen, I was able to pick through his arguments to find just the facts; and I could even selectively use his own words to paint a more favorable, and to some, truer, depiction of liberalization in Latin America.  However, Chasteen is selective in his arguments and, hence, paints a much drearier picture.  For instance, where Chasteen discusses the arrival of the railroad, he says it "drove a lot of peasants off the land, allowing the landlords to extend their holdings, make landless peasants their employees, and multiply their profits."  One can also sum up this situation by saying liberalization in Mexico helped establish property rights and the arrival of the railroad raised property values and created jobs for millions of landless, jobless peasants.  Although Chasteen does mention the benefits of liberalization, he minimizes them and doesn't note them as accomplishments, but merely side-notes.  Using an admitted "extreme example," Chasteen tells his readers that just three families owned a third of the land in Colima.  What the average reader won't know is that Colima is a relatively small state in Mexico, and three families owning a third of the land means there were three families that owned around 550 kilometers of land each.  Chasteen doesn't give his illustration any more thought than a simple sentence because it is there for shock value only.  Two sentences in chapter 6 illustrate the overarching theme of Chasteen's book:  "This basic power structure facilitated a half century of economic transformation that benefited a quarter of the population at the expense of everybody else,"   "The influence of outside examples was not all bad, of course," where Chasteen is essentially conceding that his history of Latin America entails, by and large, a negative influence from the U.S. and Europe.      	By Chasteen's definition of "neocolonialism," any country that the U.S. imports raw materials from is a neocolony; or any country which the U.S. helps achieve independence, or which we liberate, opens free trade with, and has a close political alliance with the United States is a neocolony.  But how many people would describe post World War Two Japan as a U.S. colony?  Chasteen's account of Latin American history is rabidly anti-American.  Even in describing women's liberation in the Americas, Chasteen ignores the fact that the U.S. first had women's suffrage and with our great cultural, political, and economic influence over Latin America, provoked women's liberation in countries throughout the region - this idea is not even explored in Chasteen's book.  It may seem like I am painting a "rosy" picture of U.S. - Latin American affairs; but if I wrote a history on this subject, both the good and the bad would be explored in detail.  It is a sign of intellectual laziness to revert to a simple - blame America - approach to history; and this is my major gripe with Chasteen's book.  Much of his account is, indeed, true.  However, he is selective in his history and chooses a course of anti-Americanism rather than an objective historical perspective.   
 What a mistake.  Worse than just lame.  Wish I took the time to read the critical reviews before purchasing.  Badly made with little thought and effort; a poor money for value investment 
 im moving over from vb to c#, so naturally I would like to see examples written in c# so I can get the semantics down.  This book does not do that.  Half in c#, half in vb, fully useless.  Next time release 2 versions of the book.  Or better yet, write some of it in vb, some in c#, some in python, some in perl... 
 My parents gave this book to me when I was a kid because I was a "late bloomer".  I really think that was the beginning of my self esteem issues.  I was unaware that I was a "late bloomer" until they pointed it out to me by giving me the book.  I can remember being so sad reading it and thinking there was something wrong with me.  Now that my daughter is a bit of a late bloomer, it's gotten me thinking about this book.  Please don't buy it for your kid.  If you do, please explain to them why you're giving it to them.  Don't leave it to them to draw their own conclusions that they are like Leo they can't do anything right 
 ........that "tag" is actually a bit harsh on my part........this really isn't a "bad" book (i.e. one that's full of errors).....it's simply a book filled with cute little truisms that basically anyone who reads the Wall Street Journal 4 times a year already knows.  Maxwell is really a "Christian" writer who writes these little overblown pamphlets.  Technically, not religious or prosyletizing in nature, these little books smack of old-boyisms that are tired and have been re-hashed ad infinitum.  If you're a young, junior level mid-manager, get it, read it.  It's not a terrible book........just don't expect to be "the Person Others Will Want to Follow" by ingesting this little bathroom reader 
 This woman put 23,000 people out of work. Poor thing, she got fired, received a huge severance and a book deal. Now all she can think about is herself and how bad they did her. I fell asleep reading it. 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 It seems that the only books that the Bush administration and the neocons read were "Brave New World", "1984" and Marvel Comics "Judge Dread".  The results appear here as a garbled account for the innocent abroad and judging by its ratings it's hit its intended target audience of drones squarely between the knees.  Toilet paper is cheaper and will provide hours of endless scatalogical entertainment instead for all "ye good ole boys".  
 I was made to read this book in school, and found it impossibly dull and overly descriptive.  The plot is terribly perdictable, and slow paced.  I hated this book  and definitely recommend against reading i 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 This book is certainly written in a surprising format, and some of the passages are interesting.  However, in attempting to follow Cha's thought from one part to the next, the thought itself disappears, leaving only a form.    This book is clearly written for a very narrow range of readers: recent female Korean emigres to America who also know French, as well as extremely knowledgeable scholars.  Those who do identify in some way with Cha's biography do find a way into the text.  The two articles I read as part of a study of this book were written by Korean American women, who did find something meaningful in Dictee.  I, however, was lost and confused most of the time by the often minimalist use of words, their repeating, and the sudden jumps in theme and style.    Buy this book only if you fit into the above mentioned category, or if you have much time and desire to struggle through a confusing work for a questionable reward 
 I just felt that there was nothing in the workbook that was useful. Most of the material was something I would be embarassed to try on a group, and I have to say, this will end up in the next garage sale 
 It's not like the album is bad.  It's just not the RJD2 that we all knew and loved not so long ago.  It's definitely pop.  A blend of Jon Brion and (you'll hate me for saying it) Badly Drawn Boy.  Both those artists are great, but RJD2 what have you done? 
 My daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them.  She learned how to move about on them although a year later she's still quite wobbly.  The shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use. My problem is that there really is no way for her to stop. No knob brake like normal skates have, so most of the time she's pretty out of control or walking like Frankenstein. Also, the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own, so we have to dot it for her. It wasn't like that when I first bought it, though. We bought her normal skates for Christmas to replace these. 
 Not worth the money buy a different book if you are interesting in learning how to build kitchen cabinets.  This book is random and appears to be chapters of previously published material.  
 This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion.  The character development was weak.  The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention.  If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first.  I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series. 
 I first want to say that Piper's passion for the supremacy of Christ is contagious. I have personally benefited from his ability to bring the church's focus to what matters most: The supremacy of Christ and the glory of God among the nations.   However, I would like to express my disappointment with this book. I bought the book because I was very interested to hear how Piper would respond to the "hard sayings" of our Lord. I was very dismayed by his exposition and application of one particular demand of Jesus (Matt. 5:38-48/ Demands #28-34, 43,44). I feel that his failure to uphold what is absolutely essential to discipleship cannot be overlooked. I want to challenge Piper, as well as his avid readers and fans, to rethink their understanding of Jesus' "demand" to the church to love enemy/neighbor as he loved them.   The reason I specify "the church" is very key indeed. You see... I understand what Piper was intending to say with his title "What Jesus Demands from the World." But I feel that this reflects his misunderstanding... or perhaps confusion with Jesus' demand to his FOLLOWERS to respond with the sacrificial "non-sense" love of God in every situation. It seems that he makes no distinction between the kingdoms of the world vs. the Kingdom of God. Are we not to call people out of the kingdoms of the world to which Satan manipulates and into the Kingdom of God which cannot be thwarted?   Piper mixes much and in the end he only makes comfortable the conscience of the "American Christian." He attempts to point out the radical commands of Christ... then he makes his claims "natural" by confusing the call of the Christian and the purpose of the worldly kingdoms. Of course Jesus would never "demand" that someone like Pilate lay down his arms and "turn the other cheek." That's because Pilate was playing his role in the kingdoms of the world (Rom. 13:1-7). Pilate was not a disciple in the garden who pulled out his sword to wack at someone's head. But if he was a disciple and he had done this... he would have been scolded along with Peter.   The same would apply to the awful emperor Nero. We never hear Peter or Paul rebuke Nero for not living like Christ. And they did not change their interpretations of Jesus' hard sayings because they saw that worldly governments could never abide by these commands. They were not confused to the point of mixing the role of the church and the role of the worldly kingdoms. Romans 12 describes the role of the church vs. the role of the worldly kingdoms in Rom. 13. Only those who know Christ are expected to walk as he did (1 Jn. 2:6).   Jesus said the "world" will know we are his disciples by his non-sense love (Jn. 13:34-35). Not by our commitment to calvinism or our love for democracy. Human wisdom leads us to believe there are "personal" enemies and there are "mortal" enemies. Jesus said there are just enemies. How can we confuse this? The point is very clear. When Jesus said love your enemies... he meant we are not to forcefully resist them... and certainly NOT to kill them. Jesus said we are not to "resist" an evil person (Matt.5:39). In Greek... the word for resistance is speaking of armed revolt or defense. We are not at a loss to understand how we apply this Kingdom principle. Jesus modeled it for us. When we make exceptions to this kind of love or hint at other "love acts"... we mock our Lord's example. I am afraid Piper said a lot of good to end up saying nothing at all.  I am not talking about "pacifism." I am not talking about living up in the hills somewhere or joining an Amish community in the secluded country side of Pennsylvania. I'm also not talking about the "Third Way" of a Mr. Walter Wink who presents Jesus' ways of love like those of Ghandi or the promiscuous civil rights leader Martin Luther King. I am talking about letting Christ live his life through us in every situation while being motivated by love of God and man! I wouldn't even call it "non-resistance." I would call it resisting with Christ's love that makes no sense to the world... yet... it is overcoming evil and confounding those who mean us harm. (For we know this love does no harm to its neighbor according to Rom. 13:10) Now that... is truly radical!   We must take more seriously Christ's person and work. This is absolutely essential to our faith. When we ignore kingdom principles (or change them) we cease to be in the world and establish ourselves as permanant citizens. At this point...we lose our distinct identity and we deny our true citizenship (Phil. 3:20). The church should have no fear of taking Jesus "more absolutely" than he intended (p.238). Quiet honestly, how do you get more absolute in love than in the example of Christ himself? And we are called to do the same.  Finally, I would like to comment on Piper's usage of "allegiance." We do not share an allegiance in "two directions" (p.325.) Jesus never said anything of the kind. Is Jesus condoning pledging allegiance to some other King or power? By no means! Submission and support do not mean the same. We understand our relationship to the world around us by our allegiance to Christ alone! I'm so tired of Christians using "give to Caesar what is Caesar's" as if it gives them a right of passage into anything and everything political. Especially in this "Christian nation."  Respectfully I ask, "Mr. Piper, do you think your definition of love is as radical as Christ's?" We should follow the love acts of Christ. Perhaps, then we will see the foolishness and absolute absurdity in suggesting that there are "other love acts."  Piper can tell people the right way to live is to love like Christ. That he did very well throughout most of his book. But when we say there are exceptions or even hint at that... we are no different than any other religion in this world that offers nice little adages and a set of morals to live by. As with Laodicea, soon the day of comfort will be over. "Christians" will then be given the opportunity to join with the kingdoms of the world forever in hell or suffer with Christ and enjoy victory forever in the Kingdom.   My readings of the book of Revelation confirm my vision as being biblically sound. Let the separating of the sheep from the goats begin. May all who belong to Christ come out of the great harlot who has seduced his bride with maddening wine (Rev. 18)! 
 This book is boring. The answer is "Would you recommend this company's products or service 
 The idea behind this book is great, but in reality it's nearly impossible to use. I had high hopes when I purchased it but was very disappointed once I read it. The directions were confusing, and the whole book is too disjointed to be helpful. Because it was so expensive I tried several times over a year to read it and glean something I could use just to justify the expense. Each time I would walk away no better off than I was before. It's too bad the author didn't take the general idea of this book, simplify the directions, update it, and definately make the whole thing user friendly. What a waste of money 
 This book is great for a first time owner looking to learn about parrots in general and specifically about african grey parrots. It devotes a nice introduction and touches on most toopics that are important in a manner that is easy to digest for the common human. However, I feel that the book falls short on several aspects, and I found myself wanting to know more after the last sentence in each section. I thought I would leave it as just a reference manual but the book in itself is poorly cross referenced and does not even have an index! As such, the book is merely a pamphlet or guide about african grey parrots. For the ~$20 that it costs you can find the same information in much less expensive books that actually have an index. Having some experience with other parrots and with other books, I find the book lacking and plain.   I guess the book will appeal to the non-science types and those who just want to have a generic guide of how parrots behave. For those of us that want to be our parrots best friend the book falls way short of its goal. 
 I expected this book to be about PARENTING an only child per its title and was disappointed. Susan Newman did touch on some important issues such as teaching sharing and respectfulness and avoiding loneliness, although there wasn't a lot of meat to the chapters on these subjects. She also discussed being careful not to have excessive expectations of an only child, which I found interesting. However, a great deal of this book was devoted to justifying the decision to have an only child. If you're struggling with your family planning choices and would like someone to tell you repeatedly you're doing the right thing, you may enjoy this book. At this point, I don't need justification, I need information on addressing relevant issues so that I can be the best possible parent to my child. I also do not need reasons why my decision to have an only child is "superior" to the paths other families choose and was a little disturbed by the author's tone. Bottom line: this book effectively identifies some concerns of parents of only children, but I will be looking elsewhere for more substantial parenting support 
 I was looking forward to giving this to a friend for Chrismtas but when it was delivered to my house,the sound of broken ceramic rolling around inside prevented me from even opening it. Very disappointing 
 If someone wanted to write a book about Tolkien & Middle Earth, they should have researched a little better.  Not *this* garbage!  Tolkien was a CATHOLIC -- & a hard-liner at that.  Catholic.  Not Buddhist, not Pagan & certainly NOT Gnostic (sheesh!  Some of this stuff in this book was hard to read because it was so WRONG)!  Yes, he got some of his ideas from mythology (the myth part of the book is ok, I guess.  But, there are so many *other* *better* books about myth out there than *this*... I know I've read better).  But, the books are basically Catholic.  Just read the Sil & you'll see what I mean!  There's hardly *anything* in here about Tolkien's Catholic upbringing as it pertains to the books.  If I want the *real* story on Tolkien & what he believed & wrote, I'll stick w/Tolkien's Letters & Joseph Pearce.  I shouldn't have bought this book, but... well, I'm a sucker for anything Tolkien.... 
 Sorry about my english, I write from Paris France  I paid taxes for the sending of this and I have to pay again now 22,15 Euros to the postal service to have my item.  Could you explain this please?  Thank you 
 A book which is not bad as a quickie read on the basics of Camille, but it comes up quite short as an authoritative source on the storm. Many survivors stories, while compelling at times, begin to sound repetitive, and, strangely enough, leave the reader with a sense that not all has been told.  It is also quite apparent that the author is a born-again Christian, as he often elects to print survivor contentions that they were saved from the storm by their personal Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Not that this is bad per se, but is does add to the repetitiveness of the narrative, and after hearing it once it seems superfluous, as well as adding a hidden agenda to the text. This is not a National Geographic-style book about Camille; it tends to stay on a base emotional level; hardly detached, never scientific, and certainly not the last word on the topic. A disappointment, in short.   
 The first and last book I ever had read by Salman Rushdie was his Satanic Verses. I liked it, in spite of a tendency to unevenness that left me a bit unsatisfied. Yet, I remember placing it on the shelf with such masters as Amado, Allende, Garcia Marquez... My only contact with Rushdie, ever since, had been the occasional op-eds or comments I came across here and there, some of them intelligent considerations on events of our times, others sheer nonsense.  Well, with all the respect due to someone whose output not doubt has been affected by the hardships of a quite peculiar fate, unevenness seem like the only mastery Rushdie has perfected with this last novel, to the detriment of any other stylistic and literary achievement. Magical realism, when it makes its timid appearance, seems counterfeit and not at all integrated with the rest of the plot.  The two first parts, India and Boonyi, were boding well, though. I recognized the imagination served by the flowery style that had pleased me in the Verses, and to that point I didn't mind the characteristic excesses of verbosity which more often than not lead Rushdie to say in ten sentences what others might have expressed in two. Then, brutally and mercilessly, in the next part, called Max, Rushdie plunges us in a parody of Dan Brown that in terms of nonsensicality, poor research and stylistic sloppiness barely leaves anything to desire to the biggest best-selling writer of our times (which says not so little about the latter). Whether the pastiche is intentional or Rushdie unwillingly makes a concession to the spirit, or lack of such, of our era, I am unable to tell. But somehow, it's the latter I'm inclined to believe to be the case, after finding no proper reason to indulge into this from the book's perspective.  Thankfully, Rushdie brings us back for a while to a more tangible world, with a description of the last decades' developments in Cashmere which I would like to think of as accurate. While I feel myself rather well informed as to the general outline of contemporary history in that region, Kashmir hasn't been on the top of my list when it comes to details. Yet, after Max and the literary and historical massacre committed on France during World War 2, I can't help but remaining with the nagging feeling that the same sloppiness might also be pervading what I am reading in the part of the book named Shalimar the Clown, which covers a subject I'm not familiar enough with. At any rate, what we get from Rushdie's pen in this part is what we would expect from a survey of the region by Robert Fisk - praiseworthy, without a word of argument, but a far cry from our expectations if a good novel is what we're looking for.  Finally, Kashmira, the last part of the book, brings us back home to the superficiality of contemporary America. I will grant Rushdie that he manages to convey some the superficiality very well, especially when describing the US media and judicial system's black-or-white appraisals of the very complex issues developed in the previous chapters. But I have once again to wonder whether this was fully intentional.  For again, we have landed in a segment of the book which reads as if it was written by an altogether different author, who has made his the superficiality of the authors of galloping action novels favoured by today's readership in most parts of the world. Chases, thrills, court actions, the whole bit is there, as well as a finale of superficial profundities that sounds like the author really got tired of his novel and had to get done with it quick. Are we reading a pastiche too, in this case a pastiche of a whole society? The rather shallow picture of the rather shallow personality of India/Kashmira (as opposed to those of the other characters, which are much more "real"), could lead us to believe so. There is preciously little, unfortunately, to rescue a poorly designed plot, not even the few bits of magical realism, which I otherwise am a great fan of, and not even the barely veiled satirical disgust at what goes for social interractions in that part of the world. A redeeming feature in this last part, however, is the description of the appalling conditions in the USA's prison system. But here too, I have to wonder: how much of it is accurate, and how much of it is the product of Rushdie's fancy of the moment?  At times I seem to perceive that throughout the book, Rushdie has attempted to convey a symbolic meaning. Or a series of overlapping symbolic meanings. Either he manages, most of the time, to keep this well hidden from view, or I am just not able to see through the unevenness 
 This movie is more a curiosity than a "chef d'oeuvre" (French for masterpiece) of erotism. It hasn't aged very well either... It may have been a hit then, because it was one of the first of its kind - although I am not sure.   Coming from my fellow French men, I was expecting a more sensual and passionate love story rather this 2 hours of voyeurism and sadomasochism. I found the movie rather boring, expect maybe for a few scenes. The total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some. 
 The biblical and creator references in this book are overwhelming. I thought I was buying a book about knitting, but found the references too distracting to be able to focus on her knitting instructions. 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 I am so mad at Disney and their movie "Hercules" because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories. I like Greek Mythology, but the movies have not been good at all. And this weak effort is not going to do anything about it. The plot has been changed completly, Pegasus is never mentioned in the real version, He is not trying to impress people, he had no trainer, the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned, the hydra fight is because of a different reason, ugly characters, Hercules was never in love with a chick, Hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either, and all kinds of things that I won't mention.   Don't buy this movie because it is completly different, why don't you read Greek mythology instead of watching this 
 I bought his with a lot of hope that it would feed me full of valuable information with which to arm myself the next time I go to see the doctors.  Instead it gave me the grade 7 version of what PCOS is.  It didn't have any medication information such as whether high estrogen or low estrogen bcps are better or what kind of progesterone is best, (i.e. ones with lower androgenic effects).  It simply restated what you learn about PCOS in preschool.  (well what I mean by that is it's like a censored version of what PCOS means).  It tells you things like: well, you should either tell your family about your syndrome or else lie to them because they don't need to know anything anyway.  Or: You should either find a doctor who will listen to you or find another one.  Well a B.I.G. DUHHHHHHH goes out to the authors of this book.  In the very small chapter dedicated to medications it stated that BCP's are used to regulate hormones (well every General Practitioner in the world can tell you that) it didn't even state which ones might help with which symptoms.  I could have written a better more informative book on PCOS from internet research, not to mention all the medical books I've read. My advice would be to get free information on the internet rather than buy this book and then for less basic and more in depth information on PCOS...  Check out instead It's My Ovaries, Stupid! by Elizabeth Lee Vliet. 
 I was not pleased with the quality of this recording.  The McGarrigles are just wonderful, but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster.  The first and last cuts seem OK, but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy!  The piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible.  I also didn't appreciate the sisters' reworking of several songs I already love from "The Bells of Dublin" (some of the best Christmas music ever recorded).  The sparkle I longed for just isn't there in this one 
 There were no redeeming qualities in this book. The story - which started with an interesting premise - was so poorly written that it couldn't keep me interested. I plugged along through this book, and by the time I finished, I was desperately wishing that I could turn back the hands of time and NOT waste my time.  The story had no continuity, the characters were relatively vapid, and the flashbacks were utterly annoying. I know that Laymon is supposed to have a great cult following, but based on THIS book, I can't see it. 
 I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray!  But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a "leg separator," which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...  The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors.  ; 
 Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..  Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..           
 We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and  inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a  distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the  aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing  victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers. Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some people bother to read such books because it's a waste of  trees,paper and time! Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who  like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse. She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's  supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!! Very dangerous book 
 Book is written in Fantasy, no real research done.   Absolutely trashy, no academic value.  Avoid 
 Oddly dull, considering the author makes her living by writing and that her writing is on gossip.   I was surprised at how many times I thought to myself, "I guess you had to be there," in response to her narration of an allegedly wild and crazy party.   I was amused when she noted how something or another she wrote created a "sensation." Perhaps they created a sensation among certain cliques in Manhattan or the Hamptons, but they didn't hit my radar screen. Just goes to show how each of us is the center of our own universe.    Possibly the most irksome feature in the book was when she'd refer to "my friend so-and-so" [insert extremely interesting person's name here]in passing, without offering up any information about that person. Instead, she squandered many pages on the likes of the Trumps and others of that ilk.    She kept my interest most when she described her childhood and young adulthood.         
 This was a waste of money.  My 5 year old loves taking photos.  She uses my digital camera  sometimes.    I  thought this would be a great gift for  her.  She could  see the photos on the back of the camera like  mom's.  This was not the case.   The LCD does not  project the images  and it is so small  you  can not read what mode you are in. If the batteries run  out, it erases the  photos. I think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly.  My daughter  was frustrated  quickly and  it has laid  in  the  drawer  for 3  months. If your child  likes to take  photos, I would invest in something  else 
 The debate over this movie appears to be heated. Here are my two cents. I have been a Larry fan for many years and have seen him live several times. The Blue Collar shows/movies are wonderful platforms for Larry to shine. Regretfully, this is not a well written movie and Larry suffers for it. One of the bright spots in the show was the supporting cast. Larry's partner, played by Iris Bahr, shows great talent and promise in her role. She made the most of a quirky character. I would recommend that if you just want to see this movie, rent it. If you are a die-hard Larry fan, go ahead and pick it up for keeps. I'm hoping that Larry gets a second chance to be highlighted as he is absolutely hilarious and could really do well if given a quality script to work with 
 OK, so I thought I was crazy, not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot. People were making fun of me, "HOW CAN YOU BURN ANYTHING IN A CROCKPOT"?? Now, I look at the reviews on this thing and see that I AM NOT ALONE. I always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot! Now I know that they are not SUPPOSED TO be like this!!! DO NOT EVER BUY THIS THING UNLESS YOU LIKE SCORCHING BURN GUNK!!!!! On the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours!!!!  I am trashing mine today!! 
 Very timely, very frightening, and very poorly written. A difficult read. Meic Pearse is like the speaker who likes to hear himself, but substitutes the written word - a lot of them, with a lot of syllables, and vague meaning.  The subject matter is too important to be presented in such an obtuse and confusing treatise, but worth the struggle 
 It should be noted that the Amazon description for this product is wrong. It does NOT contain both English and Japanese audio tracks. No 4Kids DVDs ever do (save for a few rare, uncut releases).  Sonic X may not be one of 4Kids WORST dubbed animes, but it ranks fairly high. Things are edited out for seemingly no reason, even the mildest of violence is cut, Japanese text and refferences are blanked and not even translated, and entire episodes are re-arranged. Not to mention, plenty of refferences to the Sonic games are not translated properly.   Do not buy this set if you are looknig for a high-quality, entertaining product 
 This book tries to cover a lot of ground, but in the end you get a sense that it has gotten you anywhere.  The first impression I got was that this book was actually a bunch of journal articles thrown together because there isn't much sense of continuity to this book.  It doesn't have an overall theme and the topics covered don't seem to connect well.  It starts off with a short biography of the Grimms, so far so good.  After that, it covers the orgins of the tales, a little dry, but not bad.  After that, there's a chapter about how the Grimm tales indoctrinate children into the bourgeoisie.  The Marxism seems a little dated.  After that, out of the blue, you get a chapter on Henri Pourrault, an obscure writer of fairy tales.  It's never explained why this writer is in this book, but I guess the author really liked this journal article and couldn't resist throwing it in.  After this, it gets really weird.  You get a chapter about how fairy tales are all about childhood sexual abuse.  If that doesn't kill your mood to read fairy tales, then the following chapter in which the author attacks the Grimm tales as outdated and obsolete and advocates the rewriting of the tales for more modern perspectives will.  One gem that the author singles out for praise is a rewriting of Cinderella.  In this version, Cinderella is a labor organizer who organizes all the workers in her kingdom.  The prince, impressed by her accomplishments, falls in lover with her and proposes.  However, Cinderella refuses to betray the worker and rejects the prince.  In the end, Cinderella moves to America and the prince commits suicide over the heartbreak.  Wow, the kids will love that one.  It's not even entertaining or enlightening for adults and borders on masochistic.  That's some of the nonsense that you'll run into in this book.  I really recommend that you pass on this 
 Cause i grew up listening to chuck,i give 3 stars,but that aint chuck i knew from rapalot,but like a tru fan i got the cd anyway,some tracks are ok,but that aint bill,if you are a wick fan buy it for your collection,if you aint,dont 
 The title is misleading because the author spends an inordinate amount of time detailing her many friends around the world and how many lunches, dinners, vacations, etc., she has with them.  There is a lot of name dropping going on here and not a lot of introspection.  Who is she trying to impress?  And, more important, why?  Her acting ability speaks for itself.  It seems to me she doesn't need to catalogue her social relationships 
 This movie has got to be the worst I have ever seen. Garfield written by Jim Davis is a wonderful comic with lots of clever humor. Garfield is my favorite comic of all time. but this movie was nothing like the comic at all. Even Jaws: The Revenge and Batman and Robin can entertain me when I'm really bored. This movie I felt like I was trapped threw the whole thing. Before this movie I believed that every movie could be slightly entertaining, nd then I saw this. If you're a fan of the comicdon't see this movie. Its not Garfield its just a bunch of characters with the same names, that don't act at all like there comic counter parts. I think if I could rate this movie any number I would rate it -10. Its just that bad. Do not by this movie. In fact don't even rent it you aren't missing anything if you don't see it. My final word is that if you want to see the real Garfield just read the comics 
 Don't bye thees. They don't look like orginals. They are really small, so it looks like glasses for children!! It's just waste of mone 
 Having read and enjoyed the author's young adult book Hoot, and looking for a light adult read, I picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light.  Frankly, it was both of thos things, but within a hundred pages, it became eminently easy to put down.  I enoy a diversion reading book periodically, and have some adult writers that meet those needs, Thomas Perry and Harold Adams to name two.  This one didn't make it for me.  It seemed to be a lot of: given a hurricane, one darn thing after another for a group of characters I didn't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together 
 First, I want to say that this is another book that tells you how to eat healthy.  Many of us who are overweight know how to eat healthy - we just don't do it.  We are addicted to our ice cream, sodas, sugar, etc.  Forget buying this book if you & your family like beef, pork, lamb, veal, etc.  On this "way of eating" you are allowed chicken, turkey & fish.  (Most of the people in my family are not fish eaters, including me, and especially talapia, which is the fish that is recommended in the recipe section of the book.  Talapia tastes like dirt to me.)  Therefore, if I were to follow the instructions, I'd be serving only chicken & turkey.  Dr. Katz's research seems sound, and I agree that the food industry has succeeded in "addicting" us to sugar and over-processed foods.  I intend to try some of the recipes (they look pretty good) and I also intend to cut the junk food out of my diet.  I've already cut out white bread.  Dr. Katz says that our appetites are lulled by flavor consistency.  So his theory is that if you eat the same flavor during the day, your brain will turn off the hunger and you will be satiated.  So, the first day you incorporate raisins & currants into your meals, the next day, apples, the next, pineapple, and so on.  I really would have tried it, but my family likes other things besides chicken & turkey!! 
 Could I just start off by saying that this is the reason Amish people live happily : they don't have to subject themselves to this kind of lousy television. What were thinking when they created this?? All I unfortunately have to say is, thank God for books 
 Initially written in 1966, this survey of 19th and 20th century modern art is defintely showing its age.  Despite five revisions between 1971 and 1993, most of the references to critical scholarship date from the 1950s and 1960s.  I do not imagine this book will be revised again.  The author maintains a rather tradition and connoisseur-bound view of the periods under consideration that sometimes lacks engagement and vibrancy.  It is as if the revolution in art criticism during the 60s/70s/80s never happened.    I don't know the reason for why the period 1880 to 1940 was chosen as the years bracketing this survey, but the result of choosing the 1880 date is that two of the major figures in French Modernism (Courbet and Manet) are conspicuously absent.  The author has also chosen to focus on individual artists, sometimes at the expense of more fully covering art movements and social context within which they emerged.  Images are decently chosen, though small and primarily black and white.  Focus of the text is on established European artists with barely a mention of artists in North America.  Readers might consider the following Open University texts covering similar ground to Hamilton but in a more engaging manner:  Modernity and Modernism : French Painting in the Nineteenth Century, by Francis Frascina, et al. Primitivism, Cubism, Abstraction : The Early Twentieth Century, by Gill Perry, et al. Realism, Rationalism, Surrealism : Art Between the Wars, by David Batchelor, et al 
 Since Arthur Hailey had his book "Airport" published which was later made into a movie in 1970, it became successful. The sequels that followed: Airport 1975 (1974) and Airport '77 (1977) did not have that big of a success, though the former fared better at the box office. I was not really that impressed with the latter in scientific terms. The plane crashes at sea and sinks to the bottom when only the forward cargo hold flooded. There was plenty of air inside the rest of the plane that, in reality, could keep it afloat for as long as it was available. The characters, like Airport 1975, overacted as well. Karen Wallace (Lee Grant) was an obnoxious alcoholic who was constantly rude to husband Martin Wallace (Christopher Lee) a professional scuba diver who drowns while accompanying Captain Don Gallagher (Jack Lemmon) to the surface to send out a mayday signal. She goes nuts and tries to open a door before she is subdued and kayoed by first stewardess and girlfriend of Gallagher, Eve Clayton (Brenda Vaccaro). There have been some sequels in the past that have meaning, but most are a waste of a movie watcher's time 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 Gary Allen's book, None Dare Call It Conspiracy,[NDCIC] utilizes anti-Semitic themes and sources.  Some details follow.  In Chapter 3 "The Money Manipulators", Jewish bankers are given substantial attention. The Rothschilds, Schiffs, and Warburgs plus the firm of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. are depicted as part of the powerful and prominent evil-doers who are part of the conspiracy to create wars, depressions, and other sinister manipulations.  Among Allen's lies--which can only be found in anti-Semitic literature.  1. "The Warburgs, part of the Rothschild empire, helped finance Adolph Hitler."   [In Chapter 5, Allen says that the financing of Hitler "was handled through the Warburg-controlled Mendelsohn Bank of Amsterdam..."  He cites 2 sources on page 85 for this assertion.  However, neither source says anything about the Warburgs having helped finance Hitler and neither source mentions any role played by the Mendelsohn Bank of Amsterdam.]  2. In Chapter 3, Allen exhumes the charges made by Father Charles Coughlin, Eustace Mullins, and Dearborn Independent articles, that the Federal Reserve System was a scheme by international bankers, led by Paul Warburg of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. to gain control of the nation's economy. This theme has always been pre-eminent in anti-Semitic diatribes about the "Jewish plan for world control"  3. In Chapter 4, "Bankrolling the Bolshevik Revolution" Allen revives a lie originated by Czarist propagandists at the end of World War I - that Jewish bankers, especially Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb and Co., financed the Bolshevik takeover in Russia. This lie was first published in the Dearborn Independent in their series of articles entitled The International Jew. For more on the articles, see:  http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/ford.html  HISTORICAL NOTE: After the Bolshevik ascension to power in 1917, emigre Czarists and White Russians disseminated the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion in Germany, France, Great Britain and the United States. These folks sought to restore the Romanovs by "proving" that the Bolshevik Revolution was a Jewish plot for world domination as described in The Protocols.  In the United States, the introduction of  The Protocols came as a result of the endeavors of Boris Brasol, a Czarist agent who remained in the U.S. after the Revolution. [At one time, Brasol headed the Czarist Secret Police].  Brasol is responsible for providing an English language version of The Protocols to Henry Ford which led to the Dearborn Independent articles. In a 1921 letter to Maj. Gen. Count Sherep-Spiridovich, Brasol wrote:  "Within the last year I have written three books, two of which have done the Jews more injury than would have been done to them by ten progroms."   Brasol vouched for the authenticity of The Protocols to the American Defense Society and he induced them to distribute copies.  A May 1941 FBI memo for U.S. Assistant Attorney General Wendell Berge described Brasol as: "extremely mercenary" and "responsible for many of the anti-Jewish protocols published in the U.S. and (he) is violently anti-Semitic."  Father Charles Coughlin serialized The Protocols in his weekly newspaper, Social Justice. Allen cites Social Justice on page 66 of NDCIC as a reliable source of info.  4. To support his lie about Jewish bankers financing Bolshevism, Allen relies heavily on a 1931 book authored by anti-Jewish White Russian, Arsene de Goulevitch. The book, Czarism and Revolution, was subsequently translated into English and published by Omni Publications of Hawthorne CA -- a one-man bookselling operation which catered to anyone seeking anti-Jewish publications.   In the preface to his book, De Goulevitch refers to the "Polish and Jewish problems" which existed in Czarist Russia and the amazing ability of the Jews for propaganda".  Gary Allen described this book "as one of the best sources of information on the financing of the Bolshevik Revolution."  DeGoulevitch cites as one of his authorities, none other than the aforementioned Boris Brasol!  Another authority cited by DeGoulevitch was General Alexander Nechvolodov, who in 1924 published, in France, a book which included the full text of The Protocols with approving commentaries.  5. Anti-semites use any scrap of evidence to associate Jews with prominent Bolsheviks and they don't especially care if the evidence is accurate so long as it conveys adverse innuendos or statements.    For example, DeGoulevitch quotes General Nechvolodov's statement that Leon Trotsky was married to a Jewish woman whose father (Jivotovsky) was among those (along with Schiff, Warburg et al) who were responsible for financing Leon Trotsky. In reality, Trotsky married twice but he never married any woman whose name was Jivotovsky.  6. Allen again cites DeGoulevitch as the source for a statement that another "important financier" of the Bolshevik Revolution was "an extremely wealthy Englishman named Lord Alfred Milner...".  According to Allen, DeGoulevitch discovered that Milner spent over 21 million rubles to finance the Russian Revolution.  Historian, Dr. Carroll Quigley, responded to Allen's assertion as follows:  "Allen's statements about Milner are almost all wrong. He was not a rich man at all...He was never a millionaire...It is nonsense to say, as Allen does, that he wanted a revolution in Russia in 1917 and gave 21 million rubles to finance it...I have been through the greater part of Milner's private papers and have found no evidence to support Allen's statements about his connection with the revolution in Russia...He was not linked in any way with the Rothschilds, as Allen says..."  7. On page 69, Allen writes: "According to the New York Journal-American of February 3, 1949: 'Today, it is estimated by Jacob's grandson, John Schiff, that the old man sank about 20,000,000 dollars for the final triumph of Bolshevism in Russia.'"  The quotation is actually from a society gossip column by pseudonym "Cholly Knickerbocker" !!  8. Allen cites Dr. Carroll Quigley's 1966 book, Tragedy and Hope as a source for his comments about the role  of "international bankers" in working toward a socialist superstate under the auspices of the UN.   When advised that Allen used him as a source, Quigley observed:  "Allen's book is full of factual errors...and is flatly wrong in his statements that my book supports his version of history...I may be correct or I may be mistaken but I certainly did not say what Allen pretends that I said...Allen not only selects evidence to prove a case, but also concocts evidence if necessary" ...  Here is another Quigley comment on Gary Allen and W. Cleon Skousen -- both of whom cite Quigley's book as "evidence" for their right-wing conspiratorial arguments.  This Quigley comment came in response to assertions made by Gary Allen during a debate in which Quigley and Allen participated together.  A question was asked concerning Gary Allen and W. Cleon Skousen's interpretation of Quigley's research:  "For example, they constantly misquote me to this effect: that Lord Milner (the dominant trustee of the Cecil Rhodes Trust and a heavy in the Round Table Group) helped finance the Bolsheviks. I have been through the greater part of Milner's private papers and have found no evidence to support that. Further, None Dare Call It Conspiracy insists that international bankers were a single bloc, were all-powerful and remain so today. I, on the contrary, stated in my book that they were much divided, often fought among themselves, had great influence but not control of political life and were sharply reduced in power about 1931-1940, when they became less influential than monopolized industry."  Incidentally, Gary Allen is quoted a Washington Post interview as confirming that he never contacted Quigley to discuss his book or to ask Quigley questions.  This is indicative of the quality of mind and "research" employed by conspiracy theorists.  Gary Allen (who had a degree in history from Stanford University!) never did any seminal research of his own.   For example: he never investigated Milner's private papers, nor anyone elses! He also didn't even think it necessary to make inquiries of Quigley---his MAJOR information source!  William Loeb, the ultra-conservative publisher of the Manchester NH Union-Leader, ran an editorial in his paper wherein he described Gary Allen's book as "anti-Semitic nonsense".  The conservative newspaper, Human Events, refused to accept advertising for Allen's book as did the ultraconservative Church League of America.  Perhaps the most enthusiastic endorsements and promotion of all of Allen's books came from the John Birch Society (JBS).    In view of Gary Allen's close association with the JBS (he was their most prolific author and contributor to JBS publications), readers might like to review what J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI thought about the JBS and its conspiracy arguments.    See my 65-page JBS Report which is based, primarily, upon first-time released FBI files and documents at:  www.birchers.blogspot.com    OR  a more recent edition at:  http://ernie1241.googlepages.com/jbs-1  
 As a devotee of the Rendell/Wexford series, it grieves me to say this one strikes out.  I kept doggedly reading the thing, thinking, this surely can't be Rendell writing this.  I can't remember any detective story with such a cast of extraneous characters, so many red herrings thrown out.  The occasional insertion of Wexford's daughter Sylvia's predicament was refreshing, but the story itself bogged down quickly.  Two girls dead, some unknown connection between the two of them, lots of suspects.  Then comes the unlikelyl (absurd?) revelation of who the original ringleader was.  Sadly, then, this reader admits disappointment over End in Tears 
 Story and picture quality aside, it is very annoying that the film seems to have been transferred off center. From the opening titles to the dialog boxes, anywhere from one to three letters of the printing are missing on the left side of the screen. I guess you get what you pay for 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 King, Keohane and Verba (KKV) present an argument for unifying qualitative and quantitative methodologies in political science under one overall rubric.  However, the book falls short in several respects.  First, KKV have a tendency to repeat themselves.  They say the same thing over and over in different ways.  In other words, they replicate what they just said.  Duplication is a big problem as well. (Get the hint yet?)  More editing would have helped.  Second, not everything they say can be accepted at face value.  They take seemingly innocent ideas and state definitive conclusions, without letting the reader know that what they're saying overturns years of epistemological research into the nature of scientific research.  People who disagree with their perspective are brushed to the side.  Third, their attempt to unify qualitative and quantitative methods suffers from a bias to the quantitative side of things.  They first explain ideas in quantitative or statistical terms, use a formal analysis, and then state something like, "the same method can be used in qualitative analysis" without always saying how, precisely, that should be accomplished.  Sometimes, I grant, they provide qualitative examples, but those serve primarily as foils against which they base their hypothesis.  Qualitative researchers quoted by them tend to get torn to shreds by the end.  This book is usually required reading in research design/ research methods courses because it's been the source of most disagreements in political science methodology over the 10 years since its publication.  But if you don't have to read it for a class, don't bother 
 This book lost almost all his credibility. Why ? How, in a book called "FRENCH ACES OF WW II", the writer dedicates only five lines ( that's right, five lines !! )to the greatest of them all, Pierre Clostermann of the RAF ?!! ( according to French official sources quoted by the author himself ). It seems that the writer want to avoid the controversy surrounding Clostermann scores: the British ( for whom he flew during all his career in WW II ) credit him with between 11 and 15 air victories, and the French give him 33 !! Ohter than this, the book doesn't even mention Rene Mouchotte, a great leader of the first Free French squadrons in RAF - numbers 340 and 341 ( although he was not an ace ). Weird distribution of topics, because Frenchmen in the RAF have only six pages to their credit ...It seem the writer got completely lost in the vast ammount of information he probably had, and the result was this catastrophic, disappointing book !! 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 I read "Veronica Decides to Die", after reading "The Alchemist," "Eleven Minutes," and "The Zahir." The previous two I enjoyed tremendously, even through "The Alchemist" didn't strike me as original and groundbreaking as the people that recommended it to me had described it. Had I not had such high expectations, perhaps, reading it would have been more rewarding of an experience. Getting to the point, "Veronica Decides to Die" is yet another novel where he's reinforcing the theme that rules all of his books, the importance of appreciating life and treasuring each moment in life as the precious gift it is. It gets tedious at times, and I won't be the first to point out that the incessant borrowing of ideas is another obvious shortcoming. He introduces psychological disorders as a sort of a rebellion against society, as always, over-simplifying things in order to draw the reader to the "natural" philosophical conclusion. The problem is, this time Coelho doesn't quite succeed. 
 I do not object to a humorous book about the exploitation of the Holocaust.  There is no doubt that the Holocaust has made too many scoundrels rich and famous.  There is also no doubt that it deserves a comic treatment, at least as part of a normalization of the abnormal.    At first the novel is indeed funny, hilariously so.  It is no crime on the part of the author to be unable to keep this up for the whole length of the book.  The humor quickly ends and the rest of the novel is deadly dull.  I am in no position to complain about this, there is considerable talent in this book.  It just cannot sustain itself long enough to be taken seriously. Nice try thought 
 In need of a fun, adventure read, I picked up an author I always seem to see on the shelves - Cussler. It was a fun, easy read, but I expected better from such a prolific author. This is a book I would have loved when I was 14 years old, but have now come to a be a bit more demanding of realism. I found the syntax and grammar of the narrator to be very poor, which detracted from the book tremendously - I was left wondering if the editor just rubber-stamped this one.  My main issue with this book was the sci-fi level of belief suspension needed to get through it *Spoilers*: 1) fully functioning artificial intelligence robots able to carry out casual conversations, circa 1993  2) Japan has secretly created a perfect missile defense program  3) an adventurer/underwater researcher sent in to take down a heavily defended fortress, instead of a trained team of SEALs/Delta/etc. 4) That a Japanese tycoon created over 100 nukes from one salvaged "Fat Man" atomic bomb from 1945.  5) That a super-secure vault would have a convenient ventillation duct large enough for a man to squeeze through.  6) Robots that drive cars 7) several ridiculously convenient coincidences that save the day  8) the usual near death witty comment, etc...  all in all, kind of fun, but don't think much or you'll ruin the plot. 
 This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE 
 Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment.  It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story. Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment. She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married. Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?  She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.  I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.  It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info. 
 This book paints Leonardo as tragic looser who never finished anything and died in despair. The real hero of the story, who occupies more than half the pages, is Charles Dent, an untalented amateur sculptor with a misguided idea to complete one of Leonardos unfinished works. As I read this book to my 5 year old daughter, I felt sabatoged by this ridiculous tale that mangles the story of a great person. And why, in a childrens book, do I need to hear that "Leonardo wore short rose-colored tunics while all the other men wore long white togas"? Stay away 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 This book pulls together a lot of information, but in my opinion it is written and organized very very poorly. I have over 10 yrs of experience in in the healthcare industry and came across this book during a grad level course in CEA.  Long, boring, convoluted sentences fill the pages of this book. It took about 3 times more time and effort to get through a page in this book compared to a page in respected journals like JAMA, NEJM, BMJ etc.  If you have lots of time and are doing research in this field - go for it. Alternatively if you want to quickly determine what CEA is about, I would recommend reading Peter Muennig and Kamran Khan "Designing and Conducting Cost-Effectiveness Analyses in Medicine and Health Care" 
 It blows the dirt around and it doesn't matter how many times I go over the carpet, I end up just going back and picking up debris by hand 
 I have read many bipolar books and I found others more helpful. The Dummies book doesn't speak to me personally, although it has lots of facts. I didn't get the sense that I would like to go to this doctor. I mean, that is my response, anyway. Also, I know that it is petty, but I don't like the title. I don't like to think of myself as a dummy, and it made me uncomfortable to carry around a book that says "bipolar disorder for dummies" in public. Maybe if it were about doing my taxes I would feel different, but I'm a bit sensitive on this point 
 Fun idea.. really, really fun idea.    However, I gave each of my teenagers (11 & 14),  a Reindeer Jelly Bean Candy Pooper.  It was some task for the kids (and the rest of the family) to get the dam things out of the packaging w/o breaking them.    The first one lost it's rear legs before getting all the way out of the package.  woof!  The second one stay together long enough to see the new year.  TIP use a razor blade and be careful of the legs 
 I ordered a subscription in jan and just received my first issue in may after several calls. Unfortunately, it is in Italian which is not mentioned in the details on amazon. they offered  to refund the remaining subscription but the first issue cost me $25. Unless you can read italian and are very patient, I would pass on this periodical. 
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 If I didn't already have enough knowledge to see the flaws in Ehrman's presentation for myself, the portions of this book actually written by the author would make me want to believe Ehrman. Everything in this book that's worthwhile is cut-and-pasted from public-domain sources. What isn't cut-and-pasted shows an author--and I use that term loosely--who is woefully under-equipped and under-trained to make any intelligent, scholarly response to a scholar of Ehrman's caliber. It's all capped-off with an appendix that includes a personal email exchange between the author and Ehrman, evidently without Ehrman's consent. This in itself demonstrates the sheer lack of professionalism in this book. I don't agree with Ehrman, but the ignorance represented by this book almost makes me embarrassed to be an evangelical 
 The subject matter of this book has the potential to be interesting.  However, the author kills any interest you may have by repeating herself over and over.  She spends about 2/3 of the book letting you know that she herself is a product of the white middle class.  She also goes on and on about what she is going to examine in the book without ever actually getting around to examining it.  Also, a considerable portion is devoted to the author's dilemma about whether or not she should have an abortion after unexpectedly becoming pregnant while having a casual relationship while writhing the book.  This book reads like a general outline of the author's diary and it's BORING.  She never truly examines the psyche of middle class suburban white girls in America - just her own meandering self observation.  Skip the book. P.S. - It's interesting that the first reviewer of the book shares the same surname as the author 
 Robert A. Heinlein, a leading writer of science fiction, wrote "A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method."  In Stranger in a Strange Land, we're introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on Mars. These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF 
 I was SO disappointed when I listened to this CD! It's a remix of the songs. They are done acousticly and it is not worth buying. I love Bon Jovi, but this was a HUGE disappointment! I am not happy with this CD at all.  
 When I first got diagnosed with ADD (as an adult) I believe the exact phrase "You mean I'm not lazy, crazy or stupid?" went through my mind.  FINALLY, there was an explanation.    So when I heard about a book by that name, certainly I had to check it out.  Once I did though, I was sorely disappointed.   I have ADD, yes.  Nevertheless, I've still managed to get pretty far in life in spite of the "handycap" the authors of this book seem so eager to hide under.   It's been a while since I read it, but I have the distinct recollection of finding some new example of a "You can't succeed in the world because you are 'disabled'" mentality on every page.  You can't do this, you can't do that, you've failed and you will continue to fail - just accept it.   Excuse me?  I don't know about the authors of this book, but MY ADD makes me creative and intuitive and perceptive and just generally a genuinely unique and awesome person (egomania aside).  Where is this addressed?  Where are the helpful hints for harnessing THAT kind of potential?  If they're in there, I sure didn't see them.  All I found were new little tricks for combatting the "affliction" with which I am (oh so unfortunately) beset.  Using these tricks, I can hope against hope for some semblence of a "normal" life they say.  Thanks but no thanks.  I'm doing pretty well so far, and I refuse to feel like some sort of mental cripple.  If you, and the authors are happy considering yourself as something less than the rest of the world because of the way your mind works, feel free - this is the perfect book for you.  But you can count me out.  
    This paperback was published less than a month after the Heaven's Gate mass suicide in March, 1997. It is a tossed-togather quickie "written" by the staff of the New York Post. In typical Post sensationalistic style, it covers the history of the cult and the mass suicide. As such it records useful information, but I'm amazed that no full length scholarly work has yet appeared on the Heaven' Gate episode.      Interestingly, I was in graduate school in Eugene, OR in 1975 when "Bo" and "Peep", the future Heaven's Gate leaders, came through town. I recall seeing ads for their presentation but, for lack of time, didn't go. Wish I had as I have a strong interest in why people believe in the type of pseudoscientific and paranormal crap Bo and Peep used to later lead dozens to their deaths.     But back to the book. It was clearly a rush job and abounds in errors and inconsistencies. On page 11 Hollywood is described as a place where stars "grinded" out films. GRINDED? The last time I checked, ther past tense of the verb "to grind" was "ground". On page 124 a "local" radio station in the area is described as receiving calls from "around the country". Still, what can one expect from New York Post writers? This is probably the best they could do.      In summary, this book does provide the basic details of the events of the Heaven's Gate cult suicide, and for that it has some value 
 We loved "One Hundred Hungry Ants", written and illustrated by the same team, but "A Remainder of One" is flawed by having language that is more advanced than the mathematical skill it is intended to teach. I would recommend it for a child who is advanced enough in language to have no problems with the meanings of words such as "former", and "infantry", and yet slow enough in math to need the lesson that 25 leaves a remainder of one when divided by 2, 3, or 4, but not 5. I spent more time explaining to my six-year-old child that the sergeant is Joe's boss, and that "former" means what he used to be but no longer is, than I spent on reading the book! The attractive block-print illustrations lack the clever jokes of those found in "One Hundred Hungry Ants", as well 
 "The Sound and The Fury" is reported as one of William Faulkner's early successes.  From this performance I have trouble understanding why.  The book alternates between dialogue and descriptive narration.  I had trouble following the story.  It sounded like a series of barely related scenes.  I did listen to a recording of this book.  I do have more trouble following recordings of fiction than I do with history.  It may be that I would do better reading this book than listening to it.  There was nothing technically wrong with the recording, I am just hopeful that a written version would be more understandable.  I would recommend giving a written version at try 
 This is just a PR piece for the Disney company, a way to build hype so more people will buy their products and see their shows.  I was hoping for some nuts & bolts advice on designing theme parks and theme park rides.  Everybody knows how to brainstorm;  everybody knows the importance of color and lighting and music;  everybody models on computers before they make physical models.  What do Imagineers do that's different?  Do they have special techniques for brainstorming, or for choosing colors, or stage lighting?  The answers are not here.  Also, what have Imagineers learned from their mistakes?  If you take this book at face value, Imagineers have never made mistakes;  everything they've done is perfect, and any criticism leveled at Walt Disney world was later retracted or countered 
 After a year and a half I finally gave up reading it. This was the worst written book I have ever read, I couldn't get into the book some of the facts were interesting but give me a break. The best part of the book was  Buffetts letter to the author. I am reading Currently reading a  "Pirate Looks at Fifty" and I am already as far as I got in this  book after reading for three days 
 This book came highly recommended to me.  With all the hype surrounding its apparent genius I expected to be blown away.  Sadly though, this book comes across as someone who has just played a video game for the first time (MYST) and decided that the kids might be on to something.  Murray proclaims that one day in the distant future, they'll make a 'holodeck' and we'll finally have true immersion.  In the mean time, we can gloss over all the interactive components that make such an experience compelling in the first place.  The future of gaming/narratology/ludology whatever-you-want-to-call-it is already here.  You don't need a "VR Suit" or some imaginary technology to have a truly immersive experience.  Her woefully uninformed look at the games of her day are completely inexcusable:  "...interactors will be lured into worlds where they float, tumble, and arc through thrillingly coloured spaces, fly through imaginary clouds and swim lazily across welcoming mountain ponds.  The nightmare landscape of the fighting maze, in which we feel imperiled may give way to enchanting worlds of increasingly refined visual dealight that are populated by evocative fairy-tale creatures."  At the time of this book's publishing (1997) games such as Jumping Flash, Mario 64, and Tomb Raider had already taken the world by storm. By reducing contemporary gaming to mindless, juvenile violence (while championing those themes in 'War & Peace', 'Hamlet' and 'Star Trek') Murray shows a complete lack of interest and imagination.    The heavy hand of narrative is not the only way to tell a story.  We don't need a "cyberdramatist" the likes of a Dickens or a Shakespeare to show us the way.  She could have explored the work of Miyamoto, Wright or Kojima and the stories that arise out those gaming experiences.  Instead she focuses on the Miller Brothers because they offered up the most conventional form of storytelling.  Eight years on, their impact is almost forgotten.  Above all, people want to act - not in the theatrical sense, but in the name of imaginative 'play'.  Maybe someday she'll prove us all wrong and the "Dr. Quinn Holodeck" will sweep us up in the rapturous joy of existing in a town populated by:   "...blacksmiths, barbers, general store owners, saloon keepers, scouts, and, of course, female doctors and who could be given their own homesteads or boardinghouse rooms in particular physical locations within the fictional world."    Sounds like fun.  Criticism aside, I did enjoy the chapter "Eliza's Daughters".  Murray's look at procedural characters and believable agents proved informative and intriguing.  If only the rest of the book were as objective and plausible then I might actually believe the hype surrounding, "Hamlet on the Holodeck".  
 This book, short and terse, takes a reproachful tone and minimalist explanation style. My biggest crticism, though, is its lack of challenging words. Those who have no trouble telling apart "incite" from "insight," "disparage" from "disparate," and "plum" from "plumb" aught to look elsewhere to satisfy their intellectual curiousities. I was wholly disappointed with this book, but very glad to have found a replacement for it called "The Bibliophile's Dictionary," which is in every way superior.  This book is a reference for the laity and, in my unintentionally high-brow opinion, should be skipped 
 The Publishers Weekly review is spot on. Half-baked quasi-thoughts from the discipline's yeasteryear, combined with troublingly absurd prognostications, won't do much to satisfy sociologists or introduce you to the discipline. The mediocre plot summaries are buttressed by more detail about the show's 186 episodes than PW admits, and about which Delaney clearly knows a great deal, but there's not enough new or interpretative to do much for Seinfeld fans. The combined weaknesses will simply frustrate anyone who is BOTH a sociologist AND a Seinfeld fan.   If you want to be the master of your domain, either disciplinarily or zeitgeistian, you'd do as well (nay, better) to find plot summaries online, open to a random page in any Sociology textbook, and discover or invent connections on your own. It'd be cheaper, more fun, more social, and (since Delaney's Sociology is somewhat shallow, and his Seinology sometimes overbearing) more educational.  I suspect that the book will sell well as a function of its title, despite the arguable poverty of its content. Maybe Delaney's snickering like Neuman, or maybe he's as incomplete as Kramer. But if you fancy yourself as having a fraction of Jerry's clarity, perception, and/or frugality, keep on shopping - IMHO, this isn't it.  OTOH, if you crave for more of a show eight years passed its cancellation (and the outtakes on DVD releases simply aren't enough) and/of if you don't know anything Sociology and want to pretend that you do without actually learning much about it, there are clearly those (see other reviews, here and elsewhere) who've found value in this volume - not that there's anything wrong with that, just that there's not clearly something right about it, either 
 It's said that the second historian was the first revisionist.  In other words, to some extent any and every telling of history reveals as much about the historian as it does the history.  But for as much as the telling of history is always interpretive, it is also entirely possible for an historian to confront, recognize, and largely neutralize her own interpretive biases; while she need not abandon or apologize for her point of view, nevertheless it is her responsibility to present all the relevant historical facts -- especially those that might cast doubt upon her interpretations and agendas -- and then argue her case with all of the relevant information on the table.  That is the difference between interpretive history and deceptive or misleading polemic.  Lepore accomplishes only polemic here, then, in that she presents as supporting evidence for her biases only her own highly questionable interpretations of the semantics of the colonists' own writings on King Philip's War.  She is hermeneutically daft, asserting a self-contained truth within those writings that is simply absurd.  Texts (especially in the case of the very personal diary entries, private letters, and firsthand accounts that constitute the overwhelming majority of the colonists' writings on King Phillip's War) do not and cannot contain some absolute, inescapable meaning that imposes itself upon the reader.  Texts communicate their real meaning only when referred to the indigenous contexts (social, political, religious, philosophical, linguistic, psychological, etc.) that produced them; when removed from those contexts and read in ignorance of them, the reader must of necessity substitute the contexts and agendas of her own experience for the authentic contexts, so that the texts will appear to have radically different meanings than they really do -- they will seem to mean whatever the interpreter wants them to mean.    And what does Lepore want the Puritans' writings to mean?  What is her agenda here?  Essentially, it is portray the Puritan colonists of 17th century Massachusetts as despicable hypocrites.  Now, as I said, if that's her agenda and her bias, that's fine; but it is acceptable for her to present the conclusions born of that agenda and bias as history only on the condition that they are argued in light of all the evidence that might call them into question.  Lepore fails on this count.  Again, she confines the supporting evidence she provides for her theses to her own highly speculative interpretations of the colonists' writings; as other reviewers have noted here, then, this book is much closer to deconstructionist literary criticism than it is to history.  She misses the forest for the trees: she makes no attempt to check her interpretive biases against the broader historical narrative that is the context of King Phillip's War.  For example, in 1622 the natives around the Jamestown settlements in Virginia attempted to eradicate the presence of the colonists, through a surprise act of genocide that followed eight years of peaceful coexistence.  The attack ultimately resulted in the deaths of two-thirds of the roughly 1200 colonists in Virginia at the time, and sent a powerful shock through the other New World colonies and their groups of sponsors across the Atlantic.  The natives committed their genocide at Jamestown only two years after the Plymouth colony was founded; it is unquestionable, then, that from the earliest years onward the Massachusetts colonists' attitudes toward their native neighbors would have been colored (and rightly so) by a great deal of suspicion and mistrust in light of the knowledge of what the Virginia natives had done to the Jamestown settlers -- only fifty years before King Phillip attempted essentially the same thing.  Yet Lepore never once mentions the genocide in Virginia, and does not recognize its immense significance for the relations of the English and the natives in Massachusetts fifty years later.  To name another example, Lepore offers no analysis whatsoever of the nature of the Puritan faith of the Massachusetts colonists, and how that faith affected their conduct in the war.  She does mention their faith in a non-specific way, when it serves to imply a monstrous hypocrisy on the part of the colonists; but never is an astute or sympathetic understanding of their religion presented, and since the early Massachusetts colonies were communities of an almost monastic fervor, devotion, and asceticism, Lepore simply ignores an immensely important factor in their motives and reasoning during King Phillip's War.  In its place, she asserts that the colonists fought to preserve their "Englishness;" in support of this idea, she presents some diary entries and editorials of the day in which the colonists wrote of their fear of becoming like the savages, should their common life in the New World continue in the direction they thought it was headed.  But it seems perfectly clear to me that Lepore has grossly misinterpreted those writings.  The colonists did not actually think that their assimilation into the native culture and way of life was real possibility: the warning that they might "become like the savages" was not a cultural apprehension of theirs, but rather the sort of hyperbole so often used in Christian homilies and catechisms and pastoral essays intended to exhort the faithful.  The Massachusetts Puritans were not afraid of becoming Indians.  They were afraid of losing their faith, losing the Christian path through life that they had sacrificed so much to preserve.  They were afraid of any compromise or waning of the Christian zeal and austerity of their near-monastic lives.  After all, it was in order to preserve the Christian life that they had left England in the first place, decades earlier: they had first settled in Holland after the English anathematized them, and then left for the New World when they saw their faith diluted by worldly comforts and distractions while living on the Continent.  So to me, the idea that they fought the natives in King Phillip's War to defend their "Englishness" is simply preposterous.  Englishness was something they had willingly left behind to purse their religion, and played no more of a role in most of their lives and motives than that of superficial, sentimental cultural orientation.  I think it's deceptive for Lepore even to pose the question, "why were the English really fighting?" as though it requires some subtle expert analysis: the colonists fought the natives because the natives were trying to kill them... it's as simple as that.   There are many more examples of Lepore's highly selective consideration of the historical record, and highly questionable reasoning and interpretation.  But it is not possible to argue them satisfactorily in a review such as this, of course: to respond adequately I would have to write a book of my own (as I've already made a good beginning of doing), taking Lepore point by point.  One thing I'll grant her is that she presents her source material openly, with no attempt to conceal certain passages that might be interpreted any number of other ways than those she has chosen.  But again, the biases and misunderstanding that a 21st century American will inevitably bring to any reading of texts produced by 17th century Puritans render any approach to understand their conduct of King Phillip's War solely by a consideration of those documents a myopic, naïve, misguided effort, and doomed to failure 
 This book has an interesting title and an interesting cover, but that's basically where it ends.  I am returning this book and I do not recommend that you buy it.  The fact that Walmart also sells it should have been a give away.  
 Very, very disappointing.  I actually was happy to finish. I would have preferred some character background as most true crime books extensively cover the character.  This had NONE! Horrible, scattered writing.  I was having to flip back pages to see who was who.  Very disappointing, especially since I was truly intrigued by this story.  Pass on this book.. 
 I read the bad reviews but I bought it, it worked for one week and died. Pure Junk, avaoid anything by Griffin 
 I really wanted to like this one but just couldn't get past the smell.   It was really over-powering.  Lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this isn't one of them.  I didn't find it drying though and it did lather very nicely.  It was just too strongly scented for my liking 
 The size 6, which I am, was too small.  I returned it for a 6.5, which was too big!  So, no shoes for me 
 I wasn't really impressed with this book.  Iwas esxpecting more of the things that I can do as a non-professional (I'm a receptionist right now) and someone who has no real selling skills.  All that the author talks about is pretty obvious things that require some serious skills, like start a business that earns an average of $700,000 a year, then sell stocks in that company.  Okay, sounds good, I'll get right on that.  He does mention some good points about saving (what we should be saving according to our income, but the stories about the people in his book (are they even real?) get to sound a little out of my ballpark.  I like the idea of finding something that you're good at and make a lot of money off of it, but is that always possible?  I like painting buckets, but there is only a small market for that (I've even tried to sell online).  I'm skeptical about the stock advice- don't invest passively, he says.  I was told that the best way to invest was to picka or fund that you're confident and let it ride, because "beating the market is nearly impossible, " someone once told me.  So, if I can't invest aggresively, and can't dramatically increase my income (or get rid of all of my expenses), the only thing left for me is real estate.  I think that point was made after the housing boom made the author rich, but the market isn't going anywhere now.    I'm still looking for good advice 
 Well, if you are a Neanderthal guy with no experience at all on comunnication with people on your own species, buy this book RIGHT NOW. On other hand, if you are even a little polite and educated this book will not tell you anything new. Anyway, if you are looking to increase your comunicattion skills, you could use one or two pages of the whole book. I think that it is too litle for 200 more pages.It is up to you 
 As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences 
 I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned.  Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market.  The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it.  Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on.  On other occasions it completely locks up.  The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message "PROTECT UNPLUG".   The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner.  I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system.    First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load.  To insert a disk one has to press an "Eject" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk.  If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over.  Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be.  On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful.  I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception.  Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review.    Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great.  It's average.  Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass.  The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it.  But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now.  I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon.    
 While overall I found this book enjoyable enough to read, I must agree with the aforelisted reviewer Mr. Sam King that Reid does not do a good job in getting his facts straight. I too found glaring errors in his history of rock in the late sixties. His writing style is OK, but I think it's irresponsible to do such a lame research job in such a high-profile publication. Most people probably don't know, won't care, or won't notice, but I was pretty appalled 
 This book reads like stereo instructions!  In fact, it contradicts itself more often stereo instructions.  Many terms are used but not defined.  Basically, if you are a student, it's impossible 
 This is by far the most boring Beverley book, although competing for the title with her next, "To Rescue a Rogue."  The beginning is quite promising.  But than the action just stalls.  The love story is completely unconvincing and sorely lacking any tension.  Throughout the book, Jane agonizes whether to tell Simon the secret we readers know.  St. Bride is described as a wild character, with adventurous blood of his ancestor Ademar running through his veins.  But he comes across as a wimp.  Also, he marries the woman he barely knows when it is not quite clear that he is even attracted to her.  To fulfil a dying friend's wish?  Who on earth does that without an excellent reason, even in a romance novel?  It is not so clear how this man obliged our hero.  Then, after talking to his friend Hal, who really is in love, Simon decides that he too is "thunderstruck."  It just doesn't fly.   Apart from the somewhat interesting beginning -- very little is going on in the rest of the book. Just extremely boring conversations. Simon's cause -- fighting for the rights of Canadian Indians -- is entirely undeveloped.  He just drops this idea to go home and "do his duty" to the family.   In my opinion, reading an old Beverley book for the second or third time is time better spent 
 I have found this book to be confusing to use and therefore of little to no value. If I had seen in a bookstore and not Online I would not have purchased it. I also purchased Schaum's Outline of General Topology which is very good 
 I found this book entertaining in terms of the anecdotes they use to illustrate their points.  However, I was deeply disappointed with the degree of conviction they maintain based primarily on a data sample of a little more than 100 firms.  That compares to more than 30,000 transactions globally in a normal year.  I find it difficult to have much confidence in their conclusions.  I find it annoying that author's often seem to promote either their agenda, their firm, or a particular point of view by using either data that tends to support their conclusions or a sample that is too small to be meaningful.  Nonetheless, if you are interested in being entertained, this book is for you...howerver, if you are interested in some modicum of rigor, you need to look elsewhere 
 Dreyfus' understanding of distance learning is quite limited. On page 39 of this book he defines distance learning as "the correspondence-course model of anonymous information consumers." Distance learning has a lot more going for it than that, I have found that there is a lot of interactivity in online courses and a high level of communication with the professors. I took one of Dreyfus' classes at Berkeley as an undergraduate and I never got to talk to him, there was no face to face learning. If you feel that the lecture method is the only way to learn, then the internet is not for you. If you want to feel like a "disembodied presence" go take a class at Berkeley as an undergrad 
 I get allegory. I understand that's what is trying to happen here, but a writer still needs to craft characters and the story.  The four protagonists: Jack, Staphanie, Randy and Leslie are interchangable. There is no moment in this book where the reader gets a chance to develop a rapport with these people. Instead, they are instantly thrust into the crisis.   The plot turns on dialogue, and when the same words could come from any of the characters, the story dissolves into a mess 
 When I first received the product and installed it I had a few configuration issues (not unusual) but now, after 8 months of service, they are telling me I need to purchase an upgrade ($69.99) or I will have no virus protection.  I contacted Customer Service (what a misnomer) as no one was available to actually speak to me and the automated system was like one of those automated phone loops you enter when trying to contact any company.  I finally gave up and an now shopping for a newer and more reliable antivirus and protection system.  I did not get a full year of service, got jerked around and have lost all faith in this software package.  I wish any other users good luck 
 I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back.  It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.  Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  But, I would not waste the time if I were you 
 I am a nursing student and former editor with a Master's degree in English.  This may sound extreme, but I think this book is dangerous. The problem with this book goes beyond wordiness, poor organization and contradictory information. It involves a process.  The student dedicates an hour or two reading a chapter, puts the book down and says, Boy, I've worked hard; I must have learned something.  And, yes, the student has worked hard. Very hard. The student has waded thigh-high in verbiage for nearly two hours. So, he's right to think he's worked hard to understand the material.  But that doesn't mean the student has learned a commensurate amount. He hasn't.   In other words, this book is deceptive. You work hard, so you think that translates into knowledge, but what you're working hard to do is to understand what in the heck the authors are saying.  This book needs a no-nonsense editor. Someone who understands that more words doesn't mean greater clarity.   The school I attend uses this book. I suffered the first year; the second year, I never touched this book. I bought a different one.  If you're a student, don't waste your time, like I did. Your hours will be better spent with other texts. 
 I heard great things about this book and was disappointed.  It did not reveal anything I didn't already know and some of the material is dated.  It is a preinternet type tight style that you see at higher limits and if you are playing higher limits, you already know this stuff 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 I loved Mortal Kombat,and I thought the sequel would carry on the great Kombat legacy.I was heartily dissapointed when I saw annihilation.Brian Johnson was cool as Khan,but some of the special effects were so fake I had to laugh.Robin Shou returns as Liu Kang,the savior of Earth.After killing Shang Tsung,the group heads on home when all of a sudden,the Emperor busts up the party and sends his minions down.There,Khan makes his first appearance,along with his abnormal,yet awesome soldiers.Johnny Cage is killed,and Rayden(now played by James Remar)fights Khan,winning but sacrificing Johnny Cage.Now,Earth has seven days before it's destroyed.What I didn't like about this movie was appearances by people who had died in the first film,like Scorpion and Sub-zero.Who heard of Sub-Zero having a brother.Another thing that got me was how Liu Kang's fighting got worse since the first film.He was losing every battle,except the end,and even then he wasl osing.Do not get this film if you want to avoid dissapointment 
 I am an accounting student at the Univ. of Sask. I had to buy this text for my Mangagement Accounting class.  This book is incomplete when they are doing examples. The writers don't explain where they got  their numbers  from. It's very difficult trying to learn it. Also, the exercise problems  at the end are horrible!! They are so vague!! 
 Having seen Ann Coulter once it is rather hard to catagorize this book, especially in view of how she acts in person and her "vocabulary" off camera. Since I generally review military books I will try to stick with that topic.   Ann devotes an entire chapter in this book, 206-218, to a rather bizarre comparison: how Max Cleland lost his limbs in Vietnam to Bush's "honorable" service in the National Guard. Yes it is true that Cleland lost his limbs through an accident. This accident rated some rather derisive comments from Bobby Muller, but that does not grant Coulter the right to do the same. I saw Cleland at hearings and he left much to be desired in my opinion, especially regarding veterans issues. I dealt directly with Cleland's office and they really never really cared. And it is true he always played the sainted one during hearings. For Coulter to equate a disabling injury in Vietnam to Fort Dix, as on page 208, shows how demented she is.   What Coulter does in this chapter is denigrate Cleland's service (through an accident) so as to pump up Bush's record in the National Guard. Anybody who served in Vietnam knows what NG service was all about. Coulter tries to lie about Bush not being AWOL, which is a simple fact. Interestingly, she likes to use the Boston Globe to help prove other points in her book, also regarding Cleland (see page 212). Since that is the case, why didn't she use the Globe's excellent and extended investigation, never refuted, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Bush was indeed AWOL. And, for the record, just because somebody got an honorable discharge does not mean they never went AWOL. Indeed, my own father went AWOL before WWII, served 30 days, and received an honorable discharge in 1945 as a pilot. The only reason my father served 30 days and Bush did not is because the latter had a congressman for a father.    In Chapter 7 I had to laugh over her comment about "slutty-girls" and this "is not how women talk". Okay, but that is how YOU talk off camera, Ann.   I would like to point to two other unrelated topics. On page 312 Ann makes a ridiculous argument against legalizing drugs. Prohibition was a failure for a number of reasons, not least of which was it created crime and corruption. I don't follow her circular logic at the bottom of the page. I also don't agree with her touting herself as a "conservative success story" on page 321. Her personal life is a mess, but she is a millionaire, and that is how she measures success.   My final comment to people like Ann and her followers is this: if you are so sure a group of Americans or "liberals" are ready to "surrender" to the terrorists, why don't you strap it on and join the fight? I would have more respect for you if you even joined the National Guard as a reporter for the Stars and Stripes, you know, kind of like what Al Gore did in Vietnam. 
 Based on the pictures shown on Amazon as well as Logitech's web site, one would believe the dropping your iPod into the dock charges and provides the audio connection to the speakeres.  You'd be incorrect on both counts.  You still have to plug into the computer to charge this thing, and there's a cable (not shown in any of the pictures) that you have to plug into the top of your iPod to make the audio connection.  We returned this item and went with something by Altec Lansing in the same price range instead...we're much happier with it 
 Phoebe Hoban's BASQUIAT: A Quick Killing in Art is one of the few biographies of the painter whose brief career (1980-1988) coincided with the disgusting obsession with profit of the Eighties' art world. There is little here about his work itself, and in order to understand why Basquiat is so important you'll need a collection of his pictures.  The two big themes of the book are drugs and lots of sex with myriad women and men. I had the impression (like many, I assume) that Basquiat's sinking into drug addiction happened only after his corrupting fame, but Hoban reveals that he had been seriously abusing drugs since the age of fifteen. Basquiat's making an income by selling his body is also exhaustively treated, as are his relationships with Klaus Nomi, Rene Richards, Suzzane Mallouk, and others. The reader notices that a lot of things are being left out. It is obvious, and Hoban herself makes an allusion at one point, that Basquiat was somewhat well-read, but Hoban never talks about his intellectual activities or, with the exception of Cy Twombly, his discovery of his artistic predecessors.  After recounting Basquiat's death, there are two final chapters. The first describes the fights over his estate over the following decade. Hoban has Vrej Baghoomian coming out looking like quite the scumbag, and she describes the case of the several Basquiat forgeries. The chapter ends with a chilling visit to Basquiat's mother, now left extremely poor and mentally fragile even though she was entitled to fifty percent of all proceeds. The final chapter finally focuses on Basquiat's art itself, its themes and the painter's techniques. However, it isn't as substantial as other presentations of Basquiat's work.  If you love Basquiat's painting and really could care less who the man was, Hoban's biography has little appeal and that is why I have rated it rather low. I think that the book would be most attractive to those seeking to understand Basquiat in a historical context along with the 1980s art scene as a whole. That the work is very well-sourced makes it a useful guide to further research 
 Some years ago, a brazilian lend this book to me.It's a small and concise book.In fact the only quality of this bad book is his small size. All the rest are ridiculous Castro's propaganda. Well, I'm an (unemployed) brazilian agronomist.I must tell you that Cuba has nothing to teach about agriculture.In fact Castro's Cuba is, a complete agriculture failure.The big Cuba's crop is sugar.Well, in 1912, Cuba produced more sugar then in 2003,2004 and 2005. Cuba's experimente with organic agriculture was and is a failure.In fact, in Cuba, the general people has no flowing water, eletricity,etc. Outside privileges and money support to latin american marxists, Cuba's money goes to propaganda.And this is pure castrist propaganda. 
 sorry to say that i'm very dissapointed to own this book. For those who are new to VBA, it is not a good start from here. I also find that the example and the function covered is not practical enough to use to develop your own program. I would recomend a book written by John Walkenbach which the examples and function cover more practical 
 Very bad English and extremely difficult to read. I will definitely not recommend this book to anyone unless he is an expert in data mining 
 Ok so I have always thought Courteney Cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it. It really is the most boring show Ive seen in a long time. If you thought she was bad in scream...and friends..dont watch this...there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it. Hopefully this show will be scraped 
 Don't get me wrong.. I got sucked in by Daylight too.. but the fact is.. Aesop Rock is NOT Canibus. His lyrics DO NOT make sense.. his lyrics have never made any cohesive sense for more than two bars at a time.  The only songs even remotely worth keeping on this album are No Regrets, which is actually surprisingly well written, the excellent Daylight, and 9-5er's Anthem which is also average.  Check out Bazooka Tooth, it's Aesop's most well-produced and written album 
 I found this to be a dull look at a suburban family falling into moral ruin 
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 I ordered a Swarovsky crystal pendant which I thought was clear like one I had purchased once on a visit to a Swarovsky factory.  The one I received is clear but not like the first one.  It is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one. I was disappointed. 
 Joseph Goebbels seems somehow to be writing books from hell! Never have I read such an eloquent exposition of the sufferings of those poor, poor Naz...oh- I mean Germans at the hands of those mean, mean commies. After their benevolent invasion and occupation of the USSR the Germans definitely deserved better! That poor misundertood pacifist Hitler was outfoxed by that mean ol' Uncle Joe! Barbarossa was just a "pre-emptive" perfectly reasonable police action! Communism IS worse than Nazism! I get it! Sieg Hei...oh- I mean Deutschland uber alles 
 Even as a kid, I remember getting bored with Pippi quickly. Unless I'm not recalling correctly, each chapter stands alone, so there's no real plot as such. The other thing that bothered me was that the author bothered to create a defiant, irreverant, spunky girl hero, yet her two friends are stereotypically male and female, to the extent that they don't even have personalities--they're just cardboard cutouts, foils for the main character. Not only is Annika fearful, hesitant, afraid of risking adult disapproval, and not wanting to get her dress dirty, but she's not in the least influenced by Pippi to be more adventurous. Lindgren sold lots of books but to my mind didn't accomplish much. Unlike Caddie Woodlawn, this protagonist is too far out in left field to truly inspire girls 
 I've recently discovered Krentz at a local library. I've read most of her works by now, and her formula is a little worn from being used so often. I keep reading her mostly because there are flashes of brilliance in her  works that promise to be something more, but all of them then get lost.  Grand Passion is the worst of the lot -- I figured out the mystery of the  paintings by the second or third chapter, and the suspense and romance was  so unrealistic I was skimming every other sentence just to have the relief  of getting to the end 
 I read the reviews here about this book and loves mysteries. This one is a total bore 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 Very bad selection of songs, most of them you alredy have in others Bee Gees collections like number ones or the record.  It would be much better if the producers choice new songs like country lanes, or tears and remaster them.   Any real fan can make a better list 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 Nowhere in the description does it mention what iPODs are compatible with this charger.  I assumed the charger would work with all iPODs but it doesn't fit the new 4G iPODs 
 This book is big on eye-grabbing claims and weak on substance. It is designed to appeal to the credulous. The title is one obvious example of the lack of rigor. The book was about "radical enhancements" - including the genetic manipulations. It had almost nothing to do with evolution. The author skipped glibbly over that distinction. Readers should be very skeptical about the exaggerations, loose claims, and handwaving in this book 
 This book was a bit of a disappointment, the text is informative, but the poor black and white images are really quite awful, and not every state capitol comes with an image, which is very odd in a book of this kind..the book feels like a ph.d disertation that was bound into a book, the physical book is quite second rate in quality, though the text is scholarly..could have, should have been better...seriously over priced 
 I couldn't get past chapter 5, and that was after skipping through some of the earlier chapters. Dull descriptions, and too many of them, dominate the writing. Characters were about as exciting as bricks. Plot development--ha! This is a mystery novel: why isn't the plot going anywhere?  And lest I forget, grammatical errors abound in this novel. Tip for you, Nevada: something is not "comprised of" things, things comprise a larger object. And Yosemite being at the same *longitude* as Mississippi? Pleaaase! Give me a break, it's barely at the same lattitude; Yosemite is 225 miles north of the very northern tip of Mississippi, and Mississippi is 300 miles long N to S. Hey Barr, are you sure you weren't smoking that dope when you wrote this?  Apparently (thank you other reviews), the punchline is that a plane full of dope has crashed in the mountains and people are swarming over each other to get at it. Big whoop. Come out to LA and you can see drug dramas for real--murder, intrigue, corruption and all.  Do something useful with your time: find a good Sherlock Holmes novel 
 If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical.  Well, even if he is right, which I hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book 
 I like this story.The writer wrote people's mien very carefully. I make me feel seemingly I was in the story. It described a poor young woman and a man,they loved each other,they both bought a present to each other,and they  used different ways. The same thing was they both sold their things to by  the present. So, though they didn't have much money,their mental world was  rich 
 It is interesting to see all of the gushing reviews of this film.  I found nothing socially relevant, compelling, insightful or even remotely interesting in this film.  The pace is like watching a turtle race and creates a film that IS dull.  There is nothing to like or empathize with in any of the characters.  If your going to waste your time with any of the "Three Colors" films, watch White 
 Sviatoslav Richter brings his superb technique and penetrating musical intelligence to bear on the WTC and the result may not please scholars but it is deeply enjoyable (which is probably what Bach had in mind).  Unfortunately the sound on these recordings is abominable.  After listening for more than a couple of minutes I give up.  I think it is the fault of the original recording in an over reverberant acoustic but there is a constant "aura" which really gets in the way.  There is a far better and consistently more exciting version recorded in Innsbruck in the early 70s but it is only available in a CD version on "Polo" which is published in China.  Presumably RCA Victor has problems with the dissemination of this version in the West!  It's not a perfect recording by any means but it is far more listenable.  
 I'm appalled that my public university, the University of Virginia, would even consider paying somone like him to teach. Everything he talks about is just ridiculous.  
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant.  The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders.  Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless.  Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader.  So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was.    Do yourself a favor and keep surfing... 
 This movie smacks of sub-par quality. Unlike its two predecessors which are far superior, Blade III is plagued with a poor script, an unqualified director (sorry, David Goyer is no director), and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace. Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect. What you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters (including Snipes's Blade) who are all dressed up with no where to go. Rated or Unrated, avoid this DVD at all cost. It isn't worth the money or the effort. 
 Just in the first few paragraphs alone she makes the same point about the smell of the slave market not being quite as strong because of the cool weather 3 times.  It seemed like a redundant effort to fill pages with nonsensical information.  If she had a better editor who helped her catch these errors she could concentrate on making an even deeper more rich story which I believe she desperately wants to accomplish.  Sorry to say I won't be reading another of her stories again 
 This item is billed as "The Best Of " Shatner and Nimoy..Now I really do have to wonder about the use of the word"Best"here...Neither Shatner nor Spock can sing,so this album exists as a goof...But there really isn't anything funny about the material contained on this disc...indeed,since at the time it was recorded both performers took themselves and thier efforts very seriously,the sides on this album were never intended as joke material..The fact that they HAVE become joke material still does not excuse the fact than any of these sides,by either of these two actors,were ever recorded...Now I like a good joke when I hear one,as well as the next guy,and I appreciate comic tunes,but the dull,tedious,often over-wrought balderdash that is to be found on this album stupefies rather than entertains... Getting back to the use of the word"Best" as a descrition of what is contained on this album...If this stuff is the"best" that either man is capable of I can only shudder at the thought of what the stuff left off this compilation must sound like..."Best"...as in The"best"manure the cow has to offer?..As in It's "Best" to shoot oneself in the head rather than endure these tunes?Or maybe "best" as in IT WOULD BE "BEST"TO AVOID WASTING YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THIS FLAPDOODLE....That is a use of the word "best"that is appropriate.... 
 Despite back cover endorsements from "Sisters Today," "Liguorian" and the "National Catholic Reporter," I believe that there are a number of grave deficiences with this ostensibly Catholic medical ethics text - not the least of which is Father Richard Devine's advocacy for the acceptance of IVF within marriage.  In addition to assurance of doctrinal soundness, I find the Vatican's 1995 "Charter for Health Care Workers," the USCCB's "Ethical and Religious Directives" (2004) and the Catholic Medical Association's ethical statement to be infinitely more readable, comprehensive and concise!      Part One   This section on fundamental moral decision-making features "The Person: At the Center of Morality," "Moral Decision Making: Morality in Action," and "Conscience: The Moral Guide."  It contains a number of dated references to theologians who have dissented from the Catholic Church's magisterium (eg., the late Jesuit Richard McCormick, the former priest Daniel McGuire, and Father Charles Curran), without any corresponding reference to Pope John Paul II's 1993 encyclical on fundamental moral theology, "Veritatis Spendor" - which took dissenting notions to task - or the 1992 "Catechism of the Catholic Church."    Part Two: "Questions at the Beginning of Life"  All three chapters are characterized by minimal reference to John Paul II's 1995 encyclical on life issues, "Evangelium Vitae."   Chapter 4 "Abortion"  It seems odd that Father Devine should cite dissenting theologian Father McCormick for "The Classical Christian Teaching" (p. 78) on abortion.  As per Father Devine, "for many anti-abortionists the sole value is the life of the fetus....It is difficult to imagine how the controversy can be resolved so long as this single-focus understanding of the question dominates the debate" (p. 55).  Father Devine accurately notes that "In 1999, almost 862,000 legal induced abortions were reported to the CDC" (p. 60).  As per its own Annual Report of 2001/2002, Planned Parenthood readily acknowledges having itself performed what would constitute about one quarter of those abortions.  Father Devine may not appreciate that, in many cases, "anti-abortionists" are dealing with forces who share no interest with the "single focus" of the "anti-abortionists."  In regard to RU486, Father Devine writes: "Although not entirely free from risk, it avoids the inherent risks of surgery" (p. 59).  "Not entirely free from risk" seems very inadequate phrasing.  The Food and Drug Administration has been debating whether to make this abortifacient an "over the counter" medication - depite such stories as "Two More Women Die After Abortion Pills." (NY Times, 7/20/05).  Chapter 5 "Newborns with Disabilities"  Columnist George Will is the proud, loving father of an adult son with Down Syndrome.  He tells us that "In America, more than 80 percent of the babies diagnosed prenatally with Down syndrome are aborted....the American Association of People with Disabilities....worries that increasingly sophisticated prenatal genetic testing technologies will mean that parents who are told their expected babies are less than perfect 'will experience pressures to terminate their pregnancies from medical professionals and insurers'" (Washington Post, 4/13/05).  With fear of litigation about so-called "wrongful births," obstetricians could be tempted to engage in a "Search and Destroy" approach to prenatal diagnosis.  If they suspect something to be amiss and subtly encourage abortion, they might imagine themselves to be free of the potential for future litigation. Amidst a de facto eugenic atmosphere, there has still been an increase in the number of newborns with disabilities.  Why?     While mentioning such issues as maternal substance abuse and exposure to radioactivity or hazardous waste as predisposing factors to disability, Father Devine does not specifically explore the impact of histories of abortion, contraceptive use or sexually transmitted disease (STD).  One reviewer gathered 59 studies, for example, documenting the relationship between histories of earlier abortion(s) and increased likelihood of premature birth, which in turn is directly relate to increased likelihood of disability (...).  With each new televised advertisement for oral contraceptives, there seems to come a fastly worded, implied warning about risk to pre-born children.  The CDC notes 15.3 million new cases of STDs annually, putting newborns of an infected mom at great risk (See Washington State's Department of Health STD Factsheets.).  As per Father Devine, "There is no major teaching or document of the church [sic] that refers specifically to the dilemna of the medical care of newborns with disabilities" (p. 92).  While this statement may be technically true, it strikes me as being as informative as saying, "There is no Catechism of the Catholic Church written solely for an audience of people under 5' 2"." There is certainly clear teaching of the Church, applicable to "the medical care of newborns with disabilities"!  It is the same teaching applicable to people under 5'2" and every one of us!  Father's statement could so easily be misconstrued.  There is no theological free pass to forego the ordinary, proportionate care of an ailing newborn!  Chapter 6 "In Vitro Fertilization & Other Artificial Technologies"  This chapter appears uninformed by Pope John Paul II's addresses of 1979 - 1984, which constitute his "Theology of the Body." The Holy Father proclaimed - for a new age - the absolute beauty of open-to-life sexual intercourse within marriage.  Also appearing uniformed by the faithful-to-the-Magisterium fertility work of the Pope Paul VI Institute at Creighton University, Father Devine tries to make the case for acceptance of IVF within marriage.  Near the close of "Donum Vitae" (Instruction on Respect for Human Life in its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation), then Cardinal Ratzinger wrote: "the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith addresses an invitation...to theologians, and above all to moralists, that they study more deeply and make ever more accessible to the faithful the contents of the teaching of the Church's Magisterium in the light of a valid anthropology in the matter of sexuality and marriage and in the context of the necessary interdisciplinary approach....The precise indications which are offered in the present Instruction therefore are not meant to halt the effort of reflection but rather to give it a renewed impulse in unrenounceable fidelity to the teaching of the Church."  Again quoting Father McCormack, Father Devine treats Donum Vitae's "invitation" as though it were an invitation to dissent.  For Father Devine to infer that the Church may alter its view on the immorality of homologous IVF with Embryo Transfer is outrageous!    Father Devine dismisses concerns about IVF's enhanced risk to the pre-born child (i.e., "McCormick replies that this objection is now moot since we know form experience that there is no greater risk to the fetus from the artificial reproductive technology than there is from normal conception" (p. 115).). Astonishingly, the head of the United Kingdom's Human Fertilisation [sic] and Embryology Authority would disagree.  Because  IVF is quite expensive, women often have multiple embryos implanted: "'We know that the biggest risk from fertility treatment is caused by multiple births....Multiple births are more likely to be premature and the babies below normal birth weight....Women are designed to have healthy babies, one at a time, and with natural conception this is what usually happens'" (Daily Mail, 7/28/05).    Part Three: "Questions Concerning Illness & Disease"  Chapter Seven "Genetics" Father Devine oddly mentions that "no formal or authoritative declaration regarding cloning has yet been issued by Vatican authoritites since the appearance of Dolly on the international scene" (p.148).  This is another example of a "There is no Catechism written solely for people under 5' 2"" statement.  Yet, he would readily acknowledge that the Vatican was never caught off guard by Dolly's arrival and had already clearly condemned human cloning.    Chapter Eight "Organ Transplantation" At least in this section, Father Devine does not address the pertinent issue of brain death criteria - an issue with which John Paul II and the Vatican showed tremendous concern.  As per Pope John Paul II's "Address to the International Congress on Transplants" of 8/29/00: "With regard to the parameters used today for ascertaining death -- whether the 'encephalic' signs or the more traditional cardio-respiratory signs -- the Church does not make technical decisions. She limits herself to the Gospel duty of comparing the data offered by medical science with the Christian understanding of the unity of the person, bringing out the similarities and the possible conflicts capable of endangering respect for human dignity....the criterion adopted in more recent times for ascertaining the fact of death, namely the complete and irreversible cessation of all brain activity, if rigorously applied, does not seem to conflict....Only where such certainty exists, and where informed consent has already been given by the donor or the donor's legitimate representatives, is it morally right to initiate the technical procedures...for the removal of organs for transplant."   In "'Brain Death' - Enemy of Life and Truth," a number of physicians and others comment on the Pope's 2000 address, maintaining that  "None of the shifting sets of 'so-called neurological criterion' for determining death fulfills the Pope's requirement that they be 'rigorously applied' to ascertain 'the complete and irreversible cessation of all brain activity'....For vital organs to be suitable for transplantation... they must be living organs removed from living human beings....persons condemned to death as 'brain dead' are not 'certainly dead' but, to the contrary, are certainly alive....adherence to the restrictions stipulated by the Pope and the prohibitions imposed by God Himself in the Natural Moral Law precludes the transplantation of unpaired vital organs, an act which causes the death of the 'donor' and violates the fifth commandment of the divine Decalogue, 'Thou shalt not kill' (Deut. 5:17)."  Shortly before his own death, Pope John Paul II announced that "The Pontifical Academy has chosen to dedicate this session... - as on two earlier occasions during the 1980's - to a theme of particular complexity and importance: that of the 'signs of death', in the context of the practice of transplanting organs from deceased persons....From the clinical point of view..., the only correct way - and also the only possible way - to address the problem of ascertaining the death of a human being is by devoting attention and research to the individuation of adequate 'signs of death', known through their physical manifestation in the individual subject."  Chapter Nine "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome" While primarily pastoral, this would have been an opportune place to review John Paul II's "Theology of the Body" and the Vatican's "Truth and Meaning of Human Sexuality."    Part Four: "Questions at the End of Life"  Chapter 10 "Death and Dying"  As per Father Devine, "One issue that remains unresolved is the question of the administration of artificial nutrition and hydration" (p. 216).  As of Pope John Paul II's March 2004 "Address to the Participants in the International Congress on 'Life-Sustaining Treatments and Vegetative State,'" the issue has been thoroughly and clearly resolved: "the administration of water and food, even when provided by artificial means, always represents a natural means of preserving life, not a medical act."  Chapter 11 "Euthanasia" Father Devine awkwardly writes: "one must distinguish between deliberately and intentionally causing death by killing the suffering patient (euthanasia) and simply allowing death to occur by withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment" (p. 225).  By this poorly written statement, one might misconstrue that withholding insulin was only tantamount to "allowing death to occur."  How much more clear and less susceptible to misunderstanding is the Catechism's own definition: "Whatever its motives or means, direct euthanasia consists in putting an end to the lives of handicapped, sick, or dying persons.  It is morally unacceptable.  Thus an act of omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator.  The error of judgment into which one can fall in good faith does not change the nature of this murderous act, which must always be forbidden and excluded" (# 2277).   Part Five "Questions Concerning Health Care in General"  Chapters 12 addresses "Informed Consent," while 13 addresses "Health Care Reform."  In the latter, Father Devine reflects that "If this had been written shortly after the election of 1992, it would surely have conveyed a sense of optimism, a conviction that the nation was at last prepared to wrestle with this most complicated and vexing question" (p. 258).  Such a swooning take on Hillary Clinton's botched attempt to "reform" health care is embarassing.  Many rejected Hillary's plan, because of its treatment of abortion as a health care "right."    Conclusion  Anyone seeking an accurate account of Catholic medical ethics can start with the Vatican's 1995 "Charter for Health Care Workers" and/or the newest edition (2004) of the USCCB's Ethical and Religious Directives, as well as the Catholic Medical Association's concise ethical statement.  In addition to being doctrinely sound, these documents are infinitely more readable, comprehensive and concise, than Father Devine's book.  As they are online, they are also free of charge. 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 Black Eyed Peas have been making a name for themselves by selling to the non-intellectuals, with dumbed down lyrics, lame beats, and annoying vocals. Only in America is this the formula for certain success. Just when you thought that no band could cause an aneurysm more than Gwen Stefani, it looks like Black Eyed Peas has become number one. 
 I must say I'm a big fan of Calphalon.  I own several pots and pans from both their tri-ply stainless steel and non-stick contemporary series and I love them and highly recommend them.  I bought these knives assuming that their quality in cookware would translate into cutlery.  I ended up returning them after several days... here's why.  PROS:  Absolutely beautiful knives that are well crafted with very rigid stainless steel (more rigid than Henckels and Wustof).  The Santoku knife is a nice addition.  I loved that the steel construction went all the way to the end of the handle.  The steel provided with the set supposedly actually SHARPENS the knives as opposed to only HONING them.  Who knows.  CONS: 1. Very heavy.  Compared to the German knives, these are not agile at all and can be painful on the wrists especially when using the very substantive chef's knife.  I thought the weight would add to the cutting ease but it really did not.  On top of that, the weight was unevenly distributed making the knives feel unbalanced.  2. Short handles.  As you progress to the smaller knives, the handles got annoying short.  This just compounded the weight issue.  3. No sharpness advantage.  I ended up purchasing the Henckels twin cuisine set of knives as they were similar in design (and also has a Santoku in the set!) to the Katana series.  I noticed that even though the "VG Japanese steel" was supposed to be even sharper and stronger than the German steel, I felt like the Henckels knives were still sharper and cut through everything with much more ease.  4. Slightly harder to clean.  The integrated bolster design makes it slightly hard to clean since any sponge you use against the blade tends to snag on the sharp end of the bolster.  All the other German knives have a rounded bolster.  This is by far the least important con.  All in all, I think the Henckels Twin Cuisine knife set is extremely similar in price and design, and additionally does not suffer from the deficiencies of the Katana Series knives 
 I cannot comment on the Fire Marshall who lost his life because I do not possess any knowledge regarding who he was, what he had done, or what he may have tried to do and I thank him for his courage and sacrifice.  However, I suggest Mr. Lance conduct more research on Nancy Floyd's background and her FBI service before writing or relaying anything she says as gospel.  The book reads like a thriller and I would give it four stars as a thriller. But because the author loses credibilty in his portrayal of Nancy Floyd, I give it an overall one star 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 This volume represents the end of season one and the beginning of season two.  If you are deciding which volumes to keep in order to not have to bear the cost of all the volumes, this is one that you can safely leave out.  The first episode: "Operation Annihilate" makes for a passably good action adventure although as a plot and storyline it leaves much to be desired.  The second episode which begins season two is the weaker of the two weak episodes.  This represents the great horror-writer Robert Bloch's weakest effort as a scriptwriter for the series to date and clearly ranks among the bottom 3 ever episodes of any of the three seasons.  Still, we get to see the debut of Pavel Chekhov whose character develops very well over the entire season two.  Fret not as the episodes in season two represent the best overall episodes of classic Trek.  You won't miss this volume though unless you are a completist or one who absolutely needs to collect every episode 
 This book provides basic knowledge @ vitamins & herbs, but not very helpful with comparing brands of supplements and potency values 
 As another reviewer states the original had 150 color plates this version has only 8 in mine. The visual phenomena are so complex that without the plates you can't possibly accurately understand what the book is talking about. Sure you could make you own examples, but if you did, you would NOT be sure, given the complex examples, that you understood what the author was talking about. Instead you will have a false understanding or incomplete understanding that will make you look foolish. The publisher is cashing in on the author's previous great work without really republishing it. This is the lowest I've ever rated a book 
 If you are an experienced programmer and already familiar with design patterns, refactoring, and application architecture, then you will probably find this book to be very frustrating.  The author seems to be on a crusade to rid the world of bad coding practices, and though I fully salute his efforts, I think this book is horribly mis-titled.  A more appropriate title would have been "Principles of Web architecture and design... and a few words about Ajax".  All I wanted was to learn the mechanics of ajax, and after reading the first 100 pages and getting nothing (new) out of it, I felt like my time had been robbed 
 After reading this author's "Flexible Weapons", I had high hopes for this title. It was, however, highly disappointing. Though the overview of weapon styles is satisfactory, and the training tips somewhat helpful, the whole effort ends up being mediocre at best. Illustrations are sparse. There are much more thoughtful, seasoned, and illuminating titles to be found elsewhere 
 Mostly bland, by this time it seemed that BAD was dead in the water, nothing here matches the excitement of THIS IS. Especially annoying are `Sightsee MC!', `Ice Cool Killer' and `The Big V'. BAD goes rap? No thanks. It's easy to see why they did the whole BAD 2 thing. Buy THE GLOBE instead 
 Don't even consider watching this movie, if you already read the book and are hoping for a decent adaption to screen. This movie is more interested in showing us body parts than a good plot that moves and flows well.  Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes do nothing to brighten the outlook or dialogue of this movie, and Steve Buscemie's role is way to short to be any help in saving the torn threads of this really awful movie. Besides being, this movie doesn't inform us why the murdered girl is playing such a big important role in the film, only that men seem to enjoy her, and who was the killer. The negotiations are never really explained also, we only know they are importent to the Japanese, and the American's are a bit wary in agreeing.  If you're looking for a good Micheal Crichton movie, try Jurassic Park 1-3 or the thirteent Warrior. For all thats good and wonderful, don't, I beg you, bother with this boring, drawnout attempt at the real thing 
 We bought this at suggestion of our dentist.  However, it is difficult to use, extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press.  We used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience.  Our neighbors bought the same model, tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave.  Save your money and go back to flossing! 
 When I saw this DVD- I just had to get it, because my husband and I remembered how hilarious that one sketch was - the one where he pretends to be a white man.  But after seeing it again after all these years, I must say that our society has "outgrown" its humor.  It just isn't as funny because we've all grown to accept much edgier comedy, with the likes of Dave Chapelle, Carlos Mencia, etc.  It still was amusing and brought back good memories from back in the day, but it just wasn't as hilariously shocking as it once was 
 If you do not know UML do not buy this book. It will not teach you UML 
 This book is so incoherent, it has none form or shape. sorry Ken, I have to say this is not even a piece of crap, it is a stool of diaharea.  The book has no main theme or thread, just pieces of tips thrown at readers. the title should be changed to "a dummy's tips to SQL"... flush 
 Most of the recipes call for prepared meat, not too helpful if you want to actually "cook" on the fire. A few clever things, but I'm returning it, not very useful 
 This was a gift for my 2 year old last christmas.  The screws they provide to put the wheels on are no good. As soon as your child starts "walk" his new dog, the wheels completely unscrew, which can be a terrible choking hazzard.  We have tried everything to keep them on.  Plus the leash tore off from around poor spot's neck, and no type of glue seems to keep it on. I'm afraid this cute little toy is going into the trash. It was good idea and a cute toy, but not worth the money. You're better off buying a plastic, already put together one. 
 Given the talent involved, I have always been surprised and disapointed at how bad this studio recording is.  Kanawa is even occasionally off-pitch, and she and Carreras show little of the verve and beauty that made them  international stars.  I'd look elsewhere for a recording of this wonderful  score 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 I love the "smoky" piano bar sound of this album.  I picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh 
 As long as artists keep making albums with only one good song, people will keep getting them for free in internet.  Nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop, pop, commercial, elevator music.  If you like that kind of music, buy this CD, otherwise buy Hubert Laws, or Dave Valentin among others.  If you want to listen to good Nestor music, buy "Morning Ride", "Dance Of The Phoenix", "Talk To Me", "Mi Alma Latina" or the charanga album " Mis Canciones Primeras".  Sorry Nestor, I am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff.  When do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album 
 There are good and bad points about this book.  Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good by a bit.  There are interesting factoids presented throughout the book, which periodically does illuminate some little-known aspects of the Allied bombing of Germany that in a sense culminated in Dresden.  But the book is a mish-mash.  Every now and again the author, in explaining topic A, mentions toic B, at which point we get a multi-page exegesis on Topic B.  Unfortunately, Topic B is often at best tangential, and at worst almost irrelevant, to the main subjects addressed in the book.  It's as if the author either wanted to add words and pages for the sake of increasing volume or to show off his knowledge regarding diverse subjects.  Not well edited. 
 Everything in the book is so basic, nothing new and not told in an interesting manner. Each point could have been stated in one sentence, making the entire book a few pages long, but that wouldnt have been a book. The delivery was actually boring. Dont bother 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 This dreary account of a foul-mouthed adulterer who consistently makes the wrong choices might remind some of other tragic characters in great fiction, such as the protagonist in An American Tragedy or in  Crime and Punishment or Madame Bovary.  But the difference here is that Bob Dubois never learns, he repeatedly does the dumb thing, whether it is adultery or use of dope or abusing his wife or his poor innocent children.  One can hardly help being disgusted by a man who does not seem to have a brain in his body.  Only a moron would break all the windows in his own car when he is short of money for his wife and kids, or wreck his home, or booze and do dope when he does not know how to pay for necessary care for his child.  As for all the stuff about voodoo this may be interest to some but to me was a bore.  Surely the account of the Haitians' plight is distressing, but it helps to make this book a depressing one.  Frankly I was glad when I finished this pretentious and not well-written book, and thought Dubois got what he asked for and deserved 
 first of all i hate negative reviews just because someone dislikes an "interpretation" of a piece, however i just coudn't find any thing good to say about this cd. dvorak's ninth is mine and many others favorite because of the lyrical quality of the symphony. kubelik seems to ignore this and go right for the drama. the timpani and horns are miked way too loud and the strings are an indistinguishable mush. you can find many better on budget labels. thanks for reading and this review applies only to ninth symphony 
 The author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing, the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery.  I find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as Bag of Bones and The Stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner. Fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict. A body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body. We learn the man was from Colorado but very little else.  If the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened. I would recommend a Mary Higgins Clark mystery in place of this boo 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money. 
 I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange 
 First of all let me just say I was one of the guys who liked Atreyu before because I easily fell sucker to poor riffed, easy to listen metal. This meant when they released -The Curse- and radio hits like "Right Side of the Bed" and "The Crimson", I instantly fell for them. Now I've matured and grown over this slop like I did with Linkin Park and a heap of others.   Read Abominations review, as he is a man of sheer brilliance! He only speaks the truth! Listen to worthy Metalcore like God Forbid, Trivium, Shadows Fall, Lamb of God, Darkest Hour, Killswitch Engage, Maroon (no not Maroon 5 you ignorant retards who actually purely enjoy this), Underoath, and Zao. There, I just took a minute of my time to give you GOOD stuff to listen to! For any other good stuff read Abomination to God's review in the spotlight or Jeremy's under mine 
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 Waste of money for those hopeful expats without unlimited bank accounts. Much of the info is also outdated or seen through the proverbial rose-colored glasses. Often deceptive or misleading--I wasted more time trying to use the info during my move, than I would have just trying to figure things out on my own. Just one example, the author says you can open a bank account during a "preliminary visit" and recommends Banque Transatlantique. Then you find out on your own that you HAVE to be living in France with your green card in order to open an account AND that BT's required [high account balance]. Waste of time and money! 
 Having lived in eastern europe all my life where textbooks are more or less just like Landau's I have to say that I by far prefer the American ones, many times more expensive though they may be. This book is outdated, as it only treats integrable systems, and utterly unsuitable for learning mechanics from, though it makes an excellent review of the theory if you have already learned it from another book.   If there was nothing else to remark I would have given it three stars based on this, but the book looks like it's photocopied from the original typewritter transcript. The book (mine being a 2005 reprint) has terrible printing quality. The paper and binding look like they are the cheapest the publisher could get. If this were an estern european textbook it would be sold for $5. To top it off, my copy came with a very strange folding defect.  These defects were shared by all three of Landau's books I ordered. Needless to say, I shan't be getting the rest of them. Instead I recommend getting a newer text such as the excellent _Structure and Intepretation of Classical Mechanics_ or somesuch, and I recommend that Americans stop seeing gold in everything that's foreign 
 I really didn't like this cookbook at all.  I am very into healthy, low-fat cooking, but I want recipes to be simple and turn out good.  Pretty much every recipe I tried in this book (except for the pecan pancakes, which are quite good), turned out flat and tasteless, and often I had to purchase special ingredients and put in a lot of effort and cooking time.  I also didn't find too much of a variety here--the recipes are categorized by mealtime so if you are looking, for example, for a lot of creative ways to make salmon or shrimp, you won't find it here.  The health information is useful and educational, but doesn't add much to the quality of this book as a cookbook 
 I started to read this book, but then I thought I'd check Amazon and I saw where it was selling for 29 cents.  That convinced me that here was another boob writing about things he didn't know anything about, so I didn't finish reading it.  Now I see that O'Reilly's on some sort of tear up in Vermont about some Judge or something.....boy he can't have much to do....but then I guess he has to feed his ego... 
 I found this book to be very basic and not generally helpful. Thank 
 I'm another Stephen Hunter fan who was deeply disappointed by this one -- my guess is that Hunter wrote it on autopilot, as an exercise in self-indulgence.  It's predictable, plays on a silly "seven against Thebes" allusion, and even has an uneducated Mississipi black guy say, "I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."  If you're new to Hunter, try POINT OF IMPACT, which would be a strong candidate, for me, to be ranked the best thriller ever written. 
 ok what the hell has happened to avril? her old cd's were waaay better. like this is soo not her. i thought let go and under my skin were better. this is more hyper bouncy kinda songs..not really like her at all. ok i gotta admit this song is pretty catchy but i heard the other songs on youtube of her new cd and they're crap. she's basically talking. not singing. so i'd advise not to get i 
 That's what I feel after listening to this album... blah. I tried very hard to find this record's groove, but easy listening music is not my thing. EC the guitar God is most certainly alseep if not totally dead. The few times I heard his Stratocaster come alive, the noose was tightened and the tone was killed off before it had a chance to make a difference.  The music itself is lackluster and uninspiring. There are no stand-out tracks, and every song sounds like it could have been  written by any amateur songwriter. With such a great backing band and top-notch guests, this record should have caught fire and burned strong. The only thing notable on the whole album is the nice production.  To me it looks like EC has lost his hunger and passion for music and playing.  Very sad 
 It is the heighth of academic arrogonance for high school educators to think they should teach Huck Finn.  From an academic standpoint HF is advance college-level literature.  
 Not worth the paper it is printed on.  A superficial treatment of analysis, design and implementation of web sites.  After reading 73 pages of content-free material I finally gave up trying to find anything amid the fluff and chucked this one in the trash 
 While this book brought up some very good issues about how terrible overweight people are treated, I found it preachy and many times got irritated with Lara's whining.    I can understand that she's feeling sorry for herself because she used to be a beauty queen and now she's one hundred pounds overweight.  But I don't want to read that same thing a zillion times, right up to the end of the book.  It made me lose sympathy for Lara, and by the end of the book I thought she was a stuck up brat.  I also had difficulty with her disease, Axell-Crowne Syndrome.  It isn't real - the author made it up.  And because of this disease, Lara felt superior to other overweight people because gaining weight wasn't her fault.  Stuck up brat strikes again.  To top it off, she gets mad at other people for assuming she was overweight from eating too much, yet she assumed that exact thing with other overweight people.  How does she know the person she's looking down on isn't also suffering from Axell-Crowne Syndrome?  It's hard to relate to a hypocrite, especially one who never seems to learn her lesson and grow from it.  I didn't like other messages in the book either, such as Suzanne's gorgeous boyfriend, Tristan, hating that Suzanne is overweight.  If the point of the book is to say not everyone can be thin and that's okay, then why doesn't Tristan love Suzanne for who she is, regardless of her weight?     Anyway, I could list all the things I didn't like about this book, but it would take too long and I've got other things I'd rather do 
 50 cent is one of the worst rappers to hit a recording studio almost as bad as Webbie. I see some people wrote "I bet people did not even listen to the album they just heard the singles and thought it was soft". Well i listened to the whole album and my IQ dropped 83 points it was that retarded of an album. The only reason this sells is because white people think their cool when blasting this in their vehicles. I will never purchase a G Unit affiliated album ever again even if I like the artist because I know 50 will be on it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! 
 PEACE:  I wonder why they are not selling Kam's CD entitled "The Devil Made Me Do It" here?  LM 
 A friend of mine gave me Bad Love to read when I spent the night at his house and was looking for a book.  I started it, and took it home with me.  After almost finishing it, I called him and said I really didn't like it, at which point he started laughing and told me both he and his wife thought it was horrible, and they gave it to me as a gag!  They couldn't beleive I got as far as I did.  I like fiction, and even meaningless pop-fiction like Patterson, Stephen King, Grisham, etc., so I'm not some elitist.  With that as a background,  Bad Love is without a doubt the worst work I have ever read.  I am shocked that people have given this garbage 5 stars.  Its poorly written, has a bad plot, and....you know what....its not even worth going on.  I am only writing to warn others.  Avoid at all costs.  You would be better off shaving your head with a cheese grater than putting yourself through Bad Love.  
 Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back 
 Do not buy if you want to use with Palm OS! Spent two hours getting this book into my palm treo 600 only to have it not open. Transferred fine, just wont open. 
 I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist 
 I have no clue what this little thing is about. Dummy me thought I bought a nice little tv, but it reminds me of those little cards you'd get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand, the image changed. That's what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show. You cannot watch this thing with somebody else seated, say, 15 feet away from you. The other person (or you) gets a foggy image, or just dark shapes. Up close you see hardly anything. Buyers beware: this is not a working tv. One star for the batteries in the remote... 
 ... I read [this] book prior to a week-long trip to Venice.  This book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives.  It is a poor "guidebook" and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue--to quote Simon: "Abysmal with a capital A."  The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres.  The only upside is that it is short.  Yuck, what a waste of time.  My advice is:  get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book.  At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails.  Actually, in terms of a travelogue, "Vendela in Venice" far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen.  Although I originally bought it because it is considered a children's book, it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it... 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 It was going so well until she had to add her input on how the government should legislate a 2 woman minimum on corporate boards.  I'm a true capitalist so to hear someone propose government intervention in todays business climate is quite a turnoff 
 Sorry every one but I think this movie was so dumb. Jamie kennedy plays a slim shady moron who thinks he's black and calls himself B-rad which I think is so pathetic and even offensive to try and act black which he's really not. So I don't believe that B-rad is a true bad a** gangster rapper I think he's a huge moron who can't act his own age and race. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because of that one scene at the club where B-rad trys to do his own rap battle attack (which he really sucks at) against the real tough rappers who they all despised B-rad. That was the most funniest scene in this movie that cracked me up til I cried. 
 Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
 This wasn't a "book".  It was a few flimsy pages of very thin poor quality paper, tied together with a plastic ring.  It did nothing to help identify water fowl in flight.  Anyone can identify a duck once it is in hand.  This pamplet was a big disappointment.  A fair price for it would have been about $1 dollar, not $10 
 I've heard Al Lee speak before and thought that what he had to say was sensible.  However, although I basically agree with his approach, I just cannot recommend his book.  I found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler.  There are many much better real estate investment books out there.  Some specific complaints: * The margins are ridiculously wide; this book is much smaller than it seems. * Some of the appendixes (especially appendix A) contained too much filler. * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet.  This sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet (where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet, etc... rather than in a book.) * When I heard Al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed (eg, owning property in Dallas even if one does not live there).  The book did not really touch on either of these topics.  That said, I did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting.  These are: * The chapter on Financial Statements was useful; In particular the ways that items for a rental property (like rents due, funds in lender held escrow accounts, property taxes due, etc...) show up on the statements was interesting. * The tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it. * The tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to  be during times when school is out. * The recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase 
 LOL!  Christ!  What in God's name was Patterson thinking?  I read this book because I've been trying to check out new authors.  I fell in love with John Sandford's "Prey" novels recently, and on impulse, I picked up Hide and Seek since Patterson is supposed to be so great and I'd heard so much about him.   Boy!  What a disappointment and what a bad first impression!  The book read like one of those Lifetime Movies of the Week.  Basically Maggie Bradford is this woman who has had nothing but bad luck with men.  Husband #1 Beat her, she kills him in self defense.  She later becomes this world class singer . . .even Barbara Streisand pops up in the book to praise her music.  She finally finds true love. . .he dies suddenly.  While this is going on, we get to find out about the second main character a world class athlete named Will Shephard who just happens to be a psycho. . .and yes, you guessed it, she ends up marrying him.  The book is told from two perspectives: 1st Person when the book is focused on Maggie(she's telling you all about her crappy life), and then it switches to 3rd Person whenever the book focuses on Will.  I won't go any further I don't want to spoil it for people unfortunate enough to get around to reading this trite, contrived, soap opera novel that is utterly laughable.  It's sad when the main character is an abused woman and you just don't care about her.  AT ALL.  Oh, and Patterson, what's up with the 100 or so 3 page chapters that this book has?  
 I have followed Ethan Mordden's journey through the Broadway musical with great interest and relish. He is a writer of wit and smarts and has the capacity to bring forgotten masterpieces to life on the page.   Why then is this final instalment riddled with agressive and irrelevant snipes at "the Left"? It's as if he wants to draw some link between the decline of the musical in cultural terms with what he calls the "moral relativism" of American liberals, but his subject matter consistently lets him down. He is unable to make the case, so he resorts to unworthy sniping instead. If it's nlot relevant, leave it out.     What is it with Broadway commentators? Mark Steyn too tries to square his reactionary politics with his love for perhaps the DEFINITIVE expression of American Liberal Art - the Broadway Musical.   It leaves a sour taste in the mouth. I will read his 30s instalment when published next year, but I find myself already armed with intellectual "pre-emptive strikes" against what he may conclude about the work of, say, Marc Blitzstein.  Ugly. 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  "Maîtresse" or "Mistress" in my opinion, is one of the worst three films to be released on the Criterion Collection. The only reason I watched and reviewed it is because it was released by Criterion. The film contains very explicit depictions of sadomasochistic activity some of which involve nailing body parts to blocks of wood. There is also a graphic scene of a horse being slaughtered for meat as well as numerous scenes of people eating horsemeat that horse lovers may be highly offended by. It got an X-rating by the MPAA and was banned in many parts of the US.   The film is about a woman who secretly operates a sex dungeon in her basement. When her apartment is broken into, the burglar falls in love with her.  The only special feature on the DVD is an interview with the film's director, Barbet Schroeder 
 I am a huge fan of hard science fiction, but this book I put down a quarter of the way through and can't make myself pick it up again.  If you like pain, gore, and unpleasant images, you may love it.  I did not 
 It seems like Hard Core Logo is an example of a book that was not quiet as good as the film that was made out of it.  Perhaps I expected too much upon seeing the excellent film first, but I can't help but be disappointed with  the book.  It's novel in verse format is clever, although skimpy.  I feel  that Turner had a great story to tell, but left out all the best parts.   The characters are underdeveloped and the whole story feels empty and  unfulfilling.  It is a very short book (it took me about three times as  long to watch the movie than read the book), and while this is not  necessarily a bad thing, I felt that there had to be more in this book to  make it work.  A great idea, a great basis for a movie, this book is a bit  too hollow to be thoroughly enjoyed.  Check out American Whisky bar  instead, it's way better and a great book in itself 
 i received this cookbook as a gift recently and was eager to test it out....i wasn't impressed really. there are very few directions as to the timing of each step in the recipes, and the recipes themselves aren't very fresh or mouthwatering...most are very "classic" items that seem quite dated, as well as heavy and unhealthful...some directions to recipes are overlooked completely, very confusing for a novice.. (which i am not....)  i use JOY OF COOKING all the time and will continue to do so, also MADELEINE KAMMAN'S MAKING OF A COOK (an absolute bible!) i do not recommend the NEW YORK TIMES COOKBOOK for any level of home cook. 
 Daniel Pipes has created his entire career out of conspiracy theory, yet I am to suddenly believe that he thinks that every time a conspiracy theory pops up, it was created by some wacko who lives in a 1 bedroom apartment and distributes underground newspapers?  This is an unconvincing tome that wants us all to believe that no conspiracies exist and that if it sounds crazy it is crazy.  Fact is stranger than fiction....there is a reason why that is such a commonly known observation of life.  Pipes unfortunately will continue to dismiss a select group of conspiracy theories while of course creating future columns and books claiming of worldwide underground muslim conspiracies against humanity.  Make up your mind Daniel, are they real or fake 
 I bought this mount because I wanted to be able to adjust both the vertical and horizontal alignment of my new HDTV panel.  The product description says this item can handle up to 50 pounds.  My panel is about 44 pounds and the vertical adjustment simply cannot handle the weight of the panel.  I used the "heavy load" bolt that's supposed to take care of this but it doesn't even come close.  The TV doesn't just slip down a bit.  It just sags against the wall.  I can't imagine this mount could hold up a panel over 20 pounds without assistance.  FWIW, the mount does feel sturdy and it can hold the panel securely.  I'm using a block of wood to offset the bottom of the panel from the wall.  I'll replace that with a V-shaped brace that acts as a cable guide and will let the horizontal swivel function of the wall mount to work properly.  Also, the screws included with the mount were too small.  They didn't fit my TV and the screw heads were so small, they slipped through the larger 100mm mounting holes.  The lag bolts provided had little hex heads meant to be tightened with the included allen wrench.  Terrible.  Who wants to screw nearly 3 inches of bolt into a stud with an allen wrench?!?  I replaced them with 5/16x3" lag bolts and used a socket wrench.  I understand they're trying to make a simple installation but there's no way to get around the fact that the holes for the mount need to be drilled into the stud.  Anyone who has a drill will have a proper set of wrenches for driving proper bolts.  I only gave this two stars because, after a trip to the store for proper screws, and with the addition of a bracket to provide the proper offset, this mount seems like it will hold my TV off the floor and allow me to swivel it from side to side.  However, I wouldn't recomment this product for any panel over 15 pounds.  20 tops 
 Same problem as everyone else.. The car can not "see" the IR light and does not work..  My son played with one in the Disney Store it worked great and he loved it this was to be ih "Big christmas gift" needless to say it is a big piece of junk... 
 After reading this you'll want to nail somebody to something to.  What type of spirit in the word spiritual did the writer of these musings mean.  After this man is departed they will have to add another circle to hell.  This is just sacarine coated nausious rubbish.  I despair at some publishers sometimes. 
 I should have listened to the other reviewers...  I wanted to replace my C: drive with a faster one, and Ghost 10.0 says it can do it, but don't be fooled.  Even if you follow the extra steps from their support site (which are not in the documentation), you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors.  It will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site.  A friend recommended Acronis TrueImage which I ended using instead.  It's much easier to use, copies about 2x faster than Ghost, and best of all it works.  I cloned and replaced C drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems.  
 Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.  Whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected, such as "Reprehensible", "Rest Awhile" and "Certain People I Could Name".  But there are too few of these real songs, and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career 
 When surgical resident Josie is not second guessing her chosen career path or putting herself down, she is either lusting after sexy surgeon Houston, or doing something pretty klutzy. He is hot and bothered by what she considers her "chunky body" so what does he do - he takes her in a broom closet so that they can both get each other out of their systems.   Of course, the best laid plans and all that... Soon they are panting for each other even more, and when an accident leaves Houston without the use of his gifted hands, he's faced with the possibility of a life outside of the operating room and in need of Josie now more than ever.  So many of McCarthy's novels sacrifice plot and story for pushing-the-envelope sex scenes that border on an anatomy lesson. Perhaps in more "gifted hands," the story could have been better (or at the very least, more fleshed out). But the characters lack chemistry - and Josie is so unappealing - we know this because she beats us over the head with all her flaws over and over and over... With the price of trade paperbacks, and the lack of storyline, you'd be smart to get this one from your local library 
 Mr Bennet says nothing every other right wing looney has been sceeching for a decade! The Gays will destroy us! Divorce will ruin us! The Liberals are taking this country to H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! The Founding Fathers Mr Bennet is so fond of were Radicals, aka Liberals, not Reactionaries, aka Conservatives. Jefferson, Washington, Madison and Paine were the people who started this country,they believed in the rights of the accused, seperation of powers, division of church and state. The conservatives went back to England!! Please Mr Bennet, go back to England: The England of 1777, where your prejudices and narrow mindedness can find a happier home than here in this awful, liberal, radical, wonderful country!!! 
 I bought this book after reading Immerso's wonderful and insightful book about his hometown of  Newark, New Jersey. His new book on Coney Island was not at all what I expected. It's more like a book report than a book, consisting of bits of information taken from previous Coney books spliced together with trivia from web sites. There appears to be no primary source material or original research. Immerso repeats the traditional Coney Island stories, weaving them into a dry narrative that will be interesting only to someone who is not familiar with Coney Island. The modern color photos are not very good and seem to be used as filler. Overall, Coney Island: The People's Playground is a pedestrian effort by a good writer 
 My daughter brought these books home with her from her vacation!  Very racy stuff for a 13 year old.  Lots of the F work and the F deed is never actually done, but always speculated about and a distinct possibility, what with all that cuddling in bed.    I wonder if these books were "created" to sell stuff.  On every page you get  stuff like:  Muffie got out her new Vixen by Ralph Lauren nail polish...  All I can say is, every generation has a right to read the trash of it's choice, but this stuff, with it's crass commercialism and truly horrid characters, gave me the creeps.  Ughums.

 First she said Teri Schiavo should have Congress decide when she dies.  Now she comes out against Michael J. Fox and stem cell research.  This clueless and unattractive woman knows no shame. She's a terrible actress and writer 
 I just finished The Best Litle Girl in the World..... I hated the stereotyping. For example I got the feeling he was trying to say that only middle to upper class white girls are anorexic. Also the whole hospital stay I did not like that there was even more sterotyping with her roommate being black and some of the comments she makes. I don't understand why the author seems so narrow-minded to me when he is supposed to be an "expert". His books The Best Little Girl and The Luckiest Little Girl are both written in a way that I don't really connect with even though I read both books in less than 7 or 8 hours total.  I don't think that this promotes eating disorders in any way and I don't understand why people say it does and I guess that is the only good thing about the book. Well anyway.... there have got to be better books out there... 
 Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.  Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him   advice.  Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).  The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.  It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.  See the movie 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 due to a snafu with my computer, the first review i wrote for this book was lost.  i could have just given up, but i am determined to implore those of you considering adding this book to your library to please resist!  only because i had to choose a star rating did i give it a one star.  i would have chosen 0 star if given the choice.  though milton is obviously a talented writer and did much research for this project, she obviously has some kind of grudge against chaplin.  true, he unfortunately left a great deal to exploit with the scandals, both personal and political.  but what she so obviously neglected was his creative genius that earned him the title King of Comedy.  she emphasizes rumors as facts and takes it upon herself to tell us what chaplin was more than likely feeling or thinking about any particular subject, when there is no way she could assume.  for instance, in describing 'city lights,' a clear masterpiece, she completely distorts, in my opinion, the best movie ending EVER.  that look on the tramp's face as he looks at the girl he loves - his face so full of love, fear, hopefulness - it is unbelievably touching and beautiful, but milton insists that he is using it to manipulate his audience - hopeful he still has their devotion and fearing his hold on them has passed.  she portrays him to be an absolute monster.  clearly, he couldn't have been the easiest person to live with, but it gives her no right to drag him through the mud as she did.  i hate to think of the people out there just discovering the genius of charles chaplin - seeing her book and thinking it will be a good, truthful read.  start with the david robinson book, or jeffrey vance - they are much more honest and fair.  i keep my milton book only because i refuse to turn it over to a library or used book store to infect a future reader's mind.  
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 real-time Jane Austen style. scary. I think a lot of other people have put more eloquently every little thing that is wrong and right about the novel but I would just like to add that to me there is a lesson to learn about Fanny Price; and she was a disappointment to me. I have to admit, I wanted her to fall in love with Crawford. I'm sorry if I let out the big endings but being Edmund's distant second best is not thrilling to me, not even lukewarm. I was hoping that in all of his confidings to her there would be a brush of the hand or starring into the eyes, you know, some moment of early unknown passion, SOMETHING to assert why he chooses her. But the cruel fact remains that good girl and good boy marry and what is so interesting about that?? This book is most likely a social metaphor meant by Austen but once Henry Crawford's gone, so is the book's draw. At one point in picking up Fanny and her sister at PTMTH he holds her to his heart and I'm thinking "big moment, forgetting themselves, a spark will be released, but Austen falls short. This book is too slow for me, and too long to be so slow. If you are writing a paper fo rthis book, it won't be difficult for you have a wealth of topics to grab onto, but pleasure reading is nice just once and never EVER again 
 I bought this Barbie after seeing two pictures of angel Barbies on the website and reading the Manufacturer's Description. One picture seems to have been deleted now. The Manufacturer's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash. I trusted that the Manufacturer's description, which matched one of the pictures, was the correct angel. The doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all. It is very simple with vinyl wings. Be aware of which you are purchasing, the description is deceptive and incorrect 
 This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.  I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book.   In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story...  
 This book is informative but you have to spend more money to use his software to be able to use his methods.  At the end of it all you still have to know if a stock is going to go up or down in price.  If anyone knew that then why complicated your investing with options and just buy the stock outright to make a profit.  I also wonder why if this method is so good why would he want to share it and how does he have time for these seminars, software programming, etc?  WOuldny he be busy selling options all day and making money?  I assume he makes more money selling us his books, tools, and seminars 
 Update: After a few more listens, this album has grown on me some... still far from my favorite but quite enjoyable on its own... -------------------------------------- I put this cd on my wish list after liking every song I had heard by Travis and recieved it for Christmas. The first half of the cd is hard, raw, and practically unlistenable. The 2nd half is mostly ballads but none as good as the new albums. You should listen to some samples of this album to judge for yourself but I really like Travis, but I really don't like this album 
 I have to agree with the librarian, this book is packaged like a book for small children, but reads like a book for older school aged children and adults.  My kids did not see the humor, even after I tried to explain it to them, they just thought the pictures were scary and sad.  I frankly found the story a little past creative and venturing in disturbing 
 While this book is okay, you can get much better historical novels.  Try Allen W Eckert books.  He has written several that cover this same approximate era and places. This book is just not worth the money 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 The leaves are changing color and the days are getting cooler.  " I smell winter in the air," said bear.  " It is time for me to crawl into my cave and sleep."  " But I must tell snail  first."   	As a forest of friends, realize that the leaves are  changing and that winter is coming, they must tell each other. It starts  with bear, and she tells snail.  Snail tells skunk then skunk must tell  turtle and the list goes on. Finally, ladybug gets the message and she goes  to tell bear.  When she gets there, bear is already sleeping in her cave.  Lady bug wakes up bear and tells her that winter is near and that is time  for her to crawl into her cave and sleep.  Bear says "Ladybug, I am in  my cave and I was sleeping." Ladybug says she is sorry.   Then all the  animals say goodnight to each other. 	This book is not very exciting  compared to most children's books. There is not really a turning point.   All that the tale does is repeat the same thing from animal to animal. The  animals just tell each other that winter is coming and that it is time to  sleep. Author Denise Fleming did a poor job of writing the story.  The  moral of the story, which is to go to sleep when it is bedtime, was weak.   She could have easily put in more detail and action and still get the same  point across. 	Even though the author did a bad job with lack of  excitement she did do a good job of describing the setting and what was  going on.  When snail is moving Fleming used the words " slowly  slithered", when she described how turtle moved, she used the words  " trudged up Woodchucks hill," and she used the words "  scritch and scratch" to describe how skunk was digging.  By using  these words the reader can picture how the animals were moving. Although  the writing was bad the illustrations were good.  The pictures are the only  thing that the book has going for it.  The illustrator did a great job of  showing detail and using bright colors. The leaves were bright and  different colors, just as they would be expected to be in the fall.  Good  detail was also used with the shape of the leaves, trees, animals, and each  animal's house. Some other good things about the book are that the print is  big, there are only a few sentence on each page, and there are not very  many big words.  These are good examples of why this book would be good for  kids who are learning how to read. Because there are not a lot of big  words, so kids would be able to understand what they are reading. 	  Time to Sleep would make a great bedtime story, because it would probably  bore kids to death.  This book would be a great story for kids to read, but  because of its lack of excitement it wouldn't be a very good book to read  to them. 								- Jessica Pac 
 I bought the Avent bottles when I was pregnant because they were babiesrus's "Best Pick" Yeah right! I wonder how many are returned on a daily basis. Aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking! I would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money 
 Um, guys?  Isn't this the guy who testified with David Kay to Congress about "Saddam's nuclear program?"  So, um, now we know there was no program, right?  Which the CIA knew years ago, when Saddam's son-in-law defected.  So this book is, what exactly?  And how stupid are the reviewers below?  "Reads like a spy novel" indeed.  Apparently, this guy is still on the taxpayer's payroll, in charge of "re-educating" Iraqi scientists 
 (Two-and-half-stars out of four on normal rating scale) [Really, the rating may seem  a bit harsh, as I do like Dirty Harry  (more even than the real man behind him,  Clint Eastwood, who by the time I typed  in this review, 2006, has long since sold  out to big brother, unfortunately)  Storyline is good and "Make my Day" scene is one of best ever in Eastwood film, but stupid subplot of Locke's character and sis' rape story saps plot. Albert Popwell back for fourth consecutive D.H. picture, this time as 'Horace', Callahan's partner. Cute bulldog, too. Dirty Harry movies are either too long  or short. A Pity... Pat Hingle is good too, until he's "offed' by some of the worst punks ever to cross Dirty Harry Callahan 
 I bought this set thinking is was going to look nice for a while due to the name brand and the price.  Wrong... This pots get scratches from anything that goes near them.  After a few months of gentle use, they already have so many scratches on the outside and look awful.  Also, the handles get really hot.    
 i dont know why people like broken social scene, they are boring boring boring. i listned to this entire album and it was difficult. i wanted to turn it off really bad, but i had to go through it all to prove to myself that it is not good for anyone. for real though people, there is tons of music outthere that is not boring. you should check it out 
 I can't review this product, because I never got it! I emailed Amazon for a refund, since I was supposed to receive my order by Dec 22 and today Jan 17th I haven't receive it 
 This was not very good, in my opinion. The Ring scared the bejeezus outta me. This was not scary. Two weeks afterwards, I still find my mind wandering about one thing...why the heck didn't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room? If I walk into my house and see a half-naked boy meowing and hissing at me, I'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin 
 i ordered it throught ayerpub an never got it. delivery terms : 60 days. reply of amazon : sorry, too late, we don't care after this period, thank you for the mone 
 What a self-centered, judgemental load of horse hockey this book is.  This guy thinks he should be the arbitor of decency?  "But why shouldn't he?" you ask.  1. Miller rants about John Kerry voting to cut military spending after the end of The Cold War, even though he voted to cut it, too.  2. He claims Democrats want more immigration, although it's George W. who called for a "guest worker" program, Reagan who granted an immigration amnesty, and right wing corporations that push to keep immigrant workers here so that wages will stay low.  3. He blames homosexuals for weakening the American family, yet says nothing about Republicans weakening middle class families by quashing increases to the minimum wage, which forces parents to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet.  (And how many divorces have YOU seen because of homosexuals?  Statistically, it's most often about either money - as noted above - or too much HETEROsexual activity outside the marriage by one of the spouses.)  4. He decries the increasing lack of decency in how politicians treat one another, yet backstabs his own party members and has no complaints at all about Saxby Chambliss falsely accusing veteran, war hero, and multiple amputee (due to war wounds) Max Cleland of supporting al-Qaeda.  This guy wouldn't know decency if he shot it in a duel.  I could keep going, but by now you either get it or you're a right winger.  And given what Washington's current right wingers consider decent  -- protecting Republican pedaphiles for political gain, widespread Abramoff bribes, money laundering, Terri Schiavo interference, warrantless wiretaps, coupling tax breaks for the very rich with cuts to elderly programs, a lie-based war, etc. -- I can only recommend this book to you as a source of ironic hypocracy 
 It may be the biggest story of the 21st century, but few press outlets are telling it. In fact, until very recently, few in the U.S. were aware of the plans and even fewer denouncing what appears to be the implementation of an effort some have characterized as "NAFTA on steroids."  All American people should be very concerned at the prospect of a North American Union - and the end of hope for the free country our Founding Fathers laid before us. We must resist to the bitter end of need be and fight the push bu multinational corporations and elite bankers' push for a new world order combining elements of fascism/corporatism and and end-run around our sovereignty by unsurping the powers of Congress and the American Legal System.  Is President Bush's reluctance to control the border and enforce laws requiring deportation of foreigners who enter the country illegally part of a master plan to all but eliminate borders between the U.S., Canada and Mexico? You bet.   If President Bush's agenda is to establish a new North American union government to supersede the sovereignty of the United States, then the president has an obligation to tell this to the American people directly. The American public has a right to know.  Phyllis Schlafly, the woman best known for nearly single-handedly leading the opposition that killed the Equal Rights Amendment, sees a sinister and sweeping agenda behind the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.  "Is the real push behind guest-worker proposals the Bush goal to expand NAFTA into the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, which he signed at Waco, Texas, last year and reaffirmed at Cancun, Mexico, this year?" she asks. "Bush is a globalist at heart and wants to carry out his father's oft-repeated ambition of a 'new world order.'"  She accuses the president and others behind the effort of wanting to obliterate U.S. borders in an effort to increase the Mexican population transfer and lower wages for the benefit of U.S. corporate interests.

 This is the first Cussler I have read and I have to admit at being terribly disappointed.I have a liking for books that combine history and fiction (loved The Da Vinci Code) but this has to be one of the least readable in that genre.An important reason for this is that the hero,Dirk Pitt,is an immensely unlikable character.He's too smug,is a walking human encyclopedia who knows EVERYTHING,has all the physical and mental attributes of a God and appears to treat everyone around him with a distinct superiority complex.I ended up smirking on several occasions as his virtue's were extolled upon by all and sundry.Another drawback is the sheer number of characters.New one's keep popping up practically every chapter (and there are 78 chapters in all!).Their names and descriptions get all muddled up by the end of it and one really just stops caring about any of them.As if this weren't enough,there are several plots running parallel with each other and each of these becomes more and more ridiculous as the pages go by.To add to the boredom,detailed descriptions about cars,planes,ships,gadgets etc.are provided at regular intervals.This wouldn't necessarily have been a bad thing if it weren't completely redundant.It seems as if the author is merely trying to show off his knowledge about these things.The only reason I finished this book is because I am a completist by nature.I do realise that such books are supposed to be pure escapism and I'm all for such unbridled entertainment - except that there needs to be a method to the madness.This definitely seems like a case of biting off more than one can chew 
 I have to preface this by saying that I absolutely love eating at the candle. So delicious. before we moved from NYC, I thought we HAVE to get this book. We've tried several of the recipies, following them to the letter, and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the  hummus.  I think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies, because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless, or tasted like salt. Don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions, because they all end up runny and bland. so sad 
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 I cannot pin point it down however I found this album release almost impossible to listen too. Every song sounded too rough and jagged for my ears and the songs seemed to not flow together like they do expertly in other FLA releases. This is a release from 1992 at the beginnings of FLA. I am slowly getting every FLA album from first to latest. I have normally been able to find at least one song to like but on this album all the songs were rough and sounded like I was listening to a car manufacturing plant in progress. 
 Why? Because it underestimates our intelligence! It has nothing to do with natural health. It has to do with advertisements. It is empty, completelly. More: it looks like a woman magazine but I believe that a clever woman would feel like I feel now, angry! I paid for something that I believed but it is not. OK, we make mistakes 
 WARNING : Contains crippling SONY DRM.  You'd be better off with a VHS version 
 George Benson can be one of the best guitar players, make some of the best recordings, and sound so good, if he wanted to. If you think George Benson is any kind of jazz, you'd be right. He even started out playing straight ahead jazz. But by no means, is this a jazz album.                                         Many of the songs on here are horrible R&B with vocals, by Benson. That's ok if that's what you like, but I curtainly dont. We already got enough R&B vocalists. Benson is a talented man! Why does he have to lower himself to play this garbage.                     The only good song on this CD is Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise; and that's questionable. No, George Benson did not pull it off with his latest effort. Benson, you gotta play some jazz.                                          Any thing else, but this. Lay off the R&B vocals and show the world what a talented jazz guitarist you are 
 For anyone looking to find a detailed resource on the care of betta splendens, this book is not for you. A great deal of space in this book is devoted to the history of the fish, how they fight with other males (there are even explicit pictures of this process, which I was certainly not interested in seeing), and how to breed them. The sections covering their care are woefully lacking - the page on diseases merely lists the ailments and then offers a recommendation for another book in which to find more information. The tone of this book also stunned me - it is apparent that the author thinks of these fish as a source of income rather than as pets. Mention is made of fish that are not "exciting or saleable," and how sub-standard hatchlings should be culled or disposed of. I was quite offended by this - even the most dully-colored betta could find a happy home somewhere! The only reason I'm giving this book one star at all is because there are a lot of beautiful photos inside. It looks more like a picture book than anything else, actually. Very disappointing 
 if i could get my money back i would ask for it back, for this is the most useless Vaccum that i have ever gotten. it will not pick up very good at all. you have to run over the floore 8 or 10 times befor it will pick up and then it will not pick up everything. save you money and look at somthing els 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 This is a quite corny adventure film, one of the least significant movies Hitchcock ever made.  It deserves the two stars by Maltin.  Yes, Charles Laughton is good as the major villain, although his makeup could have used some work at times, especially during closeups.  Yes, 19-year-old Maureen O'Hara is beautiful, even if her clothes never stay wet after swimming and her makeup never gets smeared.  Yes, young Robert Newton is okay, even if his commission bearing his police credentials remain dry and clear after being in the ocean.  But on the whole, this is a melodrama one can live without.  Young people especially will guffaw at the hammy ending.   A worse problem is the print.  It's inferior.  And at one point there is a jump that eliminates five or ten minutes of the story.  There is no excuse for putting this sort of print on DVD 
 I saw the other review that said it didn't work for V173, but I bought this anyway for my V170.  It also doesn't work for V170.  Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me.  I guess sometimes the products are mislabeled.  
 I read this book and I must say that I was very dissappointed in the end.  It really had me going and kept me intrigued but the ending just messed it up.  I thought it was so stupid.  I would not reccomend this book to anyone  just because of the ending 
 I just graduated with a major in PR. This books lists 88 jobs in advertsing and PR. However, it is out of date. In the PR industry there are: bloggers, web site developers and other internet position. This books lists NONE of them. In advertising, some positions (like print traffic manager) are almost non-existant. This book needs to REMOVE old 1990's job titles and ADD the jobs that firms are hiring for in the 2000's. This review is for the 2006 version of the book (4th ed). I think the author has gotten lazy and needs to do a complete overhall. This book may be of use if you are looking for a job in PRINT advertising, but most advertising agencies seem to want a person with good design skills and not just newspaper print. This book NEVER lists web skills or HTML that many employers seek today. Sad 
 This book has a few good points, but more bad points. I liked how the alphabet is bolded throughout the book (my 2 yr old identifies each letter right off) and I like the repetition of "Shoo Fly Shoo". However, the book really doesn't have a good 'flow' and I was NOT impressed with the illustrations. The family in the book is haggard and sloppy.  This book seems more appropriate for elementary-aged children. I would imagine that classroom teachers could use it quite often. I appreciate the comment of one person saying, "for those older kids who don't know their letters, this is a more age appropriate book." I agree with that.    After reading the story, I feel like there are fly germs everywhere . .  
 How can "the truth speak for itself" when Noonan's whole writing is opinionated? Nothing she ever says is nice and she puts too much pressure on simple things that have the oportunity to be taken in a negative outlook. she's riddicilous on writing a 181 page book just raging on how she doesnt like the Clintons. I was hoping to learn something rather than struggle through gossip like, "i know for a FACT she's a loser because so-and-so from this office working at the white house said he didn't like her!!"  unbelievable. Noonan starts her "book" off by saying how she was willing to give Hillary a chance but if that's true then why is she ranting so much? If you were willing to give her a chance then don't step down on her so hard. This book is gossip and opinionated facts. If you enjoy hearing someone complain about the Clintons for 181 pages then ofcourse- this book is THE one for you!!!! otherwise Noonan is an over the top comma happy woman in her writing, who needs to keep her head out of the clouds 
 Didn't seem to make the FM reception any better, except for the fact that when I was trying to get the classical station from NYC, to my horror, I got loud and clear, the local Christian station. Not what I wanted. The AM reception was completely gone; I went back to the antenna which came with the Onkyo tuner, which sort of works. I didn't have much luck with the "pin the dot" tuning system. More gain just made it more static-y (with more pain). Bottom line will be an attempted return to CC; we'll see how that goes 
 I bought this book interested in reading about how people would react in a post-apocalyptic world.  Instead I read a soap opera.  As one reviewer wrote, the first 200 pages are spent introducing the characters and what a boring 200 pages they are.  Unfortunately, it doesn't get much better from there.  Instead of outlining how resourceful some of the characters are in order to survive, the authors are preoccupied with race and sex (more characters than you can believe are more worried about sex than where they are going to get their next meal).  If you would like to read a good post-apocalypse book take a look at Alas, Babylon.  A little dated (cold war) but a much better read than this 
 This book certainly did not live up to the advertising copy I found on Amazon.com. I found this book to be very poor in terms of usefullness of the contents. It was all fluff and appeared to be aimed, at best, toward management level people who don't have the competence to make factual based decisions on equipment purchases. It not only did not provide facts or data, it didn't provide many clues about how someone trying to make a decision would go about fact based decision making with respect to EDM. The text was highly repetitive in nature. I found its strong advocacy of relying on the manufacturers of equipment for everything from operations knowledge to purchasing evaluation, to be insulting to my inteligence 
 A CROSS WITHOUT HELL IS A CONTRADICTION: READ THE APOSTLE'S CREED.  I fully agree with the UNPOPULAR reviewer "Andy Grey" who gave it one star.  It is impossible for annihilationist to comprehend sin and the law of God both of which are linked to the doctrine of hell.  They annihlate the law and sin with hell.  The endorsers deny Anselms teaching of the infintie debt and Why God Became Man.  Instead buy the book "Eternal Christianity" by Jim Cronfel to read all of the quotes from this book if the denials of sin and the law and the atonement and justification.   PATRIPASSIANISM IN THIS BOOK:  "There is no question now of the Father inflicting punishment on the Son or of the Son intervening on our behalf with the Father, for it is the Father himself who takes the initiative in his love, bears the penalty of sin himself, and so dies." p 152  DENIAL OF ETERNAL SIN BEARING:  "God in Christ bore our sins and died our death because of his love and justice, we must not think of it as expressing eternal sin-bearing in the heart of God. What Scripture does give us warrant to say, however, is that God's eternal holy love, which was uniquely exhibited in the sacrifice on the cross, continues to suffer with us in every situation in which it is called forth." p 329 - 330   DENIAL OF PARDON BY ATONEMENT:  "Nor, as we have seen, has Christ by his sacrifice prevailed upon God to pardon us." p 173  SEE THE PATTERN DEVELOPING?  Andy Grey is currently running 3 for 44 helpful votes.  Goes to show that the truth is sparce and the path is narrow.  I ask: do the "unhelpful" voters deny sin themselves? are they saved? or are they in it for popularity 
 This book is over rated! It comes across as giving the pilot all these tips and formulas but falls way short on the task. First off,  the typeset fills only half the page making the book in reality about 25 pages. It goes on to show you basic math found in any private pilot instruction guide. FH/C temp conversion, subtracting military time, and RVR which is all the same as in the NOS/Jep charts and Ops manuals for the plane you fly. The second half of the book has the times tables, subtraction tables, and division tables. He put fuel dump calculations in along with wet runway computations, this is not only a waste for pilots flying anything short of a jet, but worthless due to FMS and EFIS on bigger airplanes not to mention the F/E sitting sideways behind the captain. In short the book is outdated. finding reciprocals, compass turns to a heading, and ANDS are all in the flight manuals. In short this book fails to teach much. It is not worth the [price] that is for sure 
 As most of the reviews say: For it's time, this is a great achivement and it is an easy-to-read introduction to the Talmud. It's chapters are easy to follow and it is well indexed.  Still, I find it lacking in some very important ways. The Talmud is a collecion of rabbinic discussions on mishna (oral tradition), halachah (law) and Torah. This version of the talmud gives us a "unified vision" of what history has to say on any given subject and is in effect a very condensed work. The author took pains to find "the essence" of decision on theses subjects. He achives this and should be commended. Still.....  This, in my opinion, goes against the very nature of the Talmud, which is opinion and discussion over the ages. The text only in some instances gives the rabbinic author, and does not provide refrences to the era in which the writting was done.  For the beginner or someone who is not of Jewish origin, this may be helpful by providing something more streamlined. Still, if a Jew has a question about what a particular Rabbi's opinion was, they will be hard pressed to find it.   Finally, I find in both the introduction and the forward an bend to the language. Passages such as, "So he [the author] had to make up his own program. He did this by following the standard theological program of mainstream Protestant Christian theology and locating statements on the topics of that program made in the Talmudic writings." (Neusner, pg. xv) worry me that the work may have an unintended Christian leaning.  This is not a fault neccessarily, and in fact may help those Christians who are looking for more during their studies--my hat's off to you!   For a Jewish student though, this could be a bit of a turn-off.  Sentences such as, "He claimed to provide not an overarching composite portrait of "Judaism" (whatever that might be) but a particular document..." (Neusner, pg. xvi) might have the same effect.   Hope this helps. Forgive my attrocious spelling : 
 I was so, so looking forward to reading "Little Women" to my daughter, so she could be caught up in it as I was at an early age.  I particularly chose the "Whole Story" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.  Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).  That's because, apparently, "Little Women" was initially published in two parts ("Little Women" and "Good Wives"), which are generally published as the same book.  Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.    Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!  I feel completely conned.  It's a five-star story - make that maybe even a seven-star story - but it's a one-star edition.  
 I'll never forget how much I hated this book, a miserable read that stands as a yardstick to measure everything I hate in fiction. Because my first Atwood novel was the masterful "A Handmaid's Tale", I eagerly sought out a replay of that unforgettable book by reading her first really acclaimed work. Reading this thin volume felt like a lifetime's penance for every novel I have ever enjoyed. Some self-conscious, dated, impressionistic, terribly indulgent rumination on the injustice of life for the modern woman, by finishing it I learned a valuable lesson, namely what it is that I hate in a novel. Read "A Handmaid's Tale". 
 I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.  If I had been in a book store and could have read a page or two I would have known immediately it was not the type of book I would read.  I'm sure it's wonderful for those who like it.  I passed it on to a friend 
 I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.   It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.  Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on.   Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.  Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.  Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".)   It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.   This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.   A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.  On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her.   As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.  These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.   Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.   It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.   So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.  There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.   I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.  For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not. 
 Based on all the hype, I thought this book would change my life.  But it didn't.  In fact, I found it to be fairly disjointed and at times, contradictory.  There were too many perspectives and the story didn't really even have a cohesive plot.  This is the most overrated book I've read since The Da Vinci Code 
 Was hoping this would be a lot of fun for my 9 year old, and her younger brothers, too.  Forget it.  Extremely overwhelming for beginner dancers and fair-to-middlin' dancing moms, too.  The moves are cool, no doubt.  But my kids won't even attempt it. The coordination is not there.  NOT, NOT, NOT begginner friendly.  Too fast and too hard 
 I read a lot of horror stories, mostly at Ezines.  I especially like ghost stories.  I was thrilled to find this collection, thought it would be better than what I usually read.  It really wasn't.  Subtle horror can be good, but this one goes too far.  Most of the stories I read paid too much attention to suspension of disbelief and ended up boring.  I didn't read the entire book. I let off after the Grant story, so I can't comment on any after that.  It may be better for someone who appreciates a highly intellectual style of horror, but I couldn't get into it 
 I'm glad I checked this book out of the library instead of buying it. I remember reading The Flying White House by  J.F. Ter Horst (Ford's press secretary) and Col. Ralph Albertazzie (Nixon's pilot), and looked forward to an updated story with the 747, plus presidents Reagan, Bush 41, Clinton and Bush 43.  Unfortunately, Mr. Walsh displays a clear bias, with far more petty comments about the Democratic presidents than the Republican ones, save for Nixon. He's especially biased against LBJ and Clinton, taking every opportunity to  make a negative comment. By contrast, he plays George W. Bush far too heroically than more objective journalists have.  Although The Flying White House was written in 1979, and thus misses much recent history, it is a far more interesting book, with better and more detailed stories, particularly the pivotal role Air Force One played on November 22, 1963 (which I consider the most momentous event in the airplane's history, not September 11, 2001 as Mr. Walsh contends).  I'll admit I enjoyed Air Force One overall simply because I'm fascinated by both aviation and the presidency. But this book stacks up poorly against the earlier work by Ter Horst and Albertazzi 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 Nothing but practice. Unless the student already knows how to do the work, there is nothing in the book to help them.  
 I was really excited to use these guidebooks. I had heard a lot of good stuff about them and they looked great when I was leafing through them. It seemed like we would have the "locals" guide to Rome. but boy was i wrong. After arriving in Rome, the books proved to be useless. Every restaurant we wanted to try seemed to be located on a street that didn't exist. I had three different maps I was using, and none of them had the streets on it. These books are great for history, but that's about it. Don't waste your time. 
 I didn't like the TV, HD sound was not working.HD picture quality is poor, improper color display. On the whole its a not good product from Sony. None of big stores like Best Buy, Circuit City etc... has this TV( I guess it is because of its ppor quality). 
 I truly cannot tell you how much I wish I'd read more reviews before buying this trash.   I, like other reviewers, love zombies.  I'm talking classic zombies, lumbering around moaning and searching for brains.  When a book says to me, "hey buy me I've got ZOMBIES!  Come on you love zombies, look at me I've got like 300 pages and they're PACKED with zombies!" and then 10 pages in I get "lol surprise we're talking and organizing and SHOOTING GUNS AND DRIVING CARS HURRR" it's unforgivable.  The book is an interesting read (for trite, contrived writing that's not even up to the  "standards" of S.D. Perry's Resident Evil books, which is pretty shameful) but...ugh I want to slap Brian Keene.  Brian Keene, you owe me five bucks, and I'm not kidding 
 What a boring love story - I wasn't impressed.  Bizarre plot, long tedious read 
 Mr. Ohrtman spends much of the book to argue his case for VOIP rather than discussions of how it works and how it interfaces with the PSTN. The technical discussions, especially for the local loop alternatives, were very basic and not of much value 
 While I have an excellent understanding of the metaphysical philosopy, the idea that one can diagnose and cure disease such as HIV and Aids with diet, castor oil packs and the like, is absurd. As a registered nurse, my first and only encounter with this author, leaves me unsure, other than book sales, why she would make this claim.   The early introduction of this holistic, and terribly simplistic approach to HIV treatment, instantly blows her credibility as any kind of holistic intuitive/healer. The book rambles and shows an overwhelming self-absorption of the author with her real or imagined skills.   
 Why not just go to the library and pick up volume 1 of the Artificial Life journal. That's all this is. Did someone really have the gall to sell us a journal twice? Yes, Virginia, I guess they did 
 I bought this book based on other customer reviews. I was disappointed. In my opinion it is only somewhat useful if you are a rank amateur and need advice buying your very first table saw. If you are looking for detailed advice and hints on use and operation, this book falls far short. I don't doubt that Mr. Mehler is a well qualified expert, but as a general table saw manual, he does not give me the information I wanted. As an example of a work that really fills the bill of a well written tool selection guide and manual, check out "Woodworking With the Router" by Hylton and Matlack for the American Woodworker series from Reader's Digest Books. I don't know what to suggest instead of this book except perhaps Taunton's Complete Illustrated Guide to Using Woodworking Tools. It is much more expensive, but well worth it and covers the entire spectrum of woodworking tools 
 Harrison Livingstone is one of the assassination investigators who only write books to stabilize his cash flow. His new work High Treason 2, does not stay on the track and is a dead end. I will not recommend this book to anyone...Instead buy HIS FORMER co-author Robert Groden's book THE KILLING OF A PRESIDENT. .. 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 I'm a fan, but not enough so that I could recommend this CD. It seems that with every passing effort, Bramhall gets a little worse. He's got a great voice, he plays a great guitar,....but the songs are just out and out mediocre. If you don't own anything by Bramhall, get the Arc Angels first, his debut solo second, then flip a coin over the two most recent. I'll continue to hope that he fulfills his potential with the next release 
 While this book does have a decent number of code samples (though it could certainly use both more samples and more detailed samples), the book seems to just be a rehash of the well-known OpenGL red book (OpenGL Programming Guide).  I've been reading them simultaneously, and I've yet to find anything of use in Angel's book that is not in the red book.  So, do yourself a favor and don't waste the time/money reading this book--your time would be better spent delving further into the code samples and online resources associated with the OpenGL Programming Guide 
 This is an open letter to the author, Barry Glassner  You appear to believe that the only reasons people limit their intake of pleasurable foods--with fats, salt, MSG, etc.--are for weight maintenance, longer life, better health and other self-serving objectives.  I have given up red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products while recognizing the loss to the pleasures of my own taste buds, but with the greater satisfaction of being able to look myself in the mirror: I am not contributing to  an industry that day-in, day-out causes enormous suffering to literally billions of animals annually in our own country alone.  Though you mention animal rights here and there in The Gospel of Food, you at no time make a connection between the joys of eating foie gras , beef, squab, and the like, and the suffering that this consumption is causing to creatures as sentient as you.   By dissing folks who shun the foods you enjoy, assuming that they have all bought into nostrums provided by quacks like Atkins, you are shortchanging many.  Millions of us refuse to partake of the pleasures of the palate that demand suffering and blood from innocent, sentient beings 
 This book is not a great value.  It does not explain German grammar with the clarity found in April Wilson's "German Quickly" or even Sandburg and Wendell's "German for Reading."  It is particularly weak when explaining prepositions and the extended adjective construction, and it does not give pragmatic advice about figuring out the various crucial elements in a German sentence.  Moreover, the exercise sentences are dull, and not worth the effort needed to translate them.  This book is a classic mainly because German teachers are too lazy to seek out substitutes 
 1) Drawings seem a little grotesque.  The proportion and perspective is often askew, and human figures are distorted.  Not terribly pleasant to look at.  2) Is this a story about a trip that one of the authors took?  It seems like a self-indulgent storyline ("Let me write about a trip a took!") and when I read it, I'm left wondering why I should be all that interested in this particular seven-state route.  3) Taking off all your clothes and running around because you're in Nevada? (Even if the author did this in reality, it doesn't add anything to the story.  A good editor should have told them so.)  4) Weird geography.  Missing from the itinerary are Indiana, Illinois, and Utah (or Idaho).  Was the story too long with these included, or was their nothing witty to say about them 
 The Sierras are much nicer when visited in person. Reading about the natural wonders found there isn't the same as actually checking them out for yourself. Perhaps if you were already familiar with the areas Mr. Muir traversed, and wish to brush up un them or revisit them literarily when unable to do so physically... THEN perhaps this book would be better 
 Why in the world would anyone publish a writer's bread and butter notes to his agent?  Besides the money, I mean.  There are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom Heinlein feels did him dirty.  But in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master.  Just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published 
 I was disappointed with this book.  It was good as far as it went, but it seemed to be very choppy and didn't answer questions that I felt would be present in anyone's mind who was reading the book.  Perhaps his 2nd book gives more details about his ability to heal, how he handles this ability, what challenges he faces, etc.  Also, because almost no names or other information was given, this book had a feeling of "made up" to it.  I would like to think that isn't the case, but I wonder why someone would write a book about their gifts and yet hide their names and any information about themselves.  What is their real reason for writing it 
 A few essays in this book merit reading.  Natalie Kusz's "On Being Invisible" speaks honestly about the pain of growing up fat and the way many of our relationships render us unseen.  David Sedaris's "A Shiner Like a Diamond" had me laughing out loud about his sister's antics in the face of her father's fat phobia.    However, several essays offended me.  In "Fat Like Him," Lori Gottlieb (recovered anorexic) writes unapoligetically about her hateful thoughts and behavior toward the fat man she met through email.  She had a sexual relationship with him, but wouldn't be seen with him in public or introduce him to her friends.  Sarah Fenske writes, in "Big Game Hunter," about "hogging:" a sport where men pick up fat women for sex because they are seen to be pathetic, desperate, easy.  The editors of the book say, "We are speaking out, speaking up, speaking back: Scoot over, skinny, the Fat have a few things of their own to say about obesity..."  THAT'S the kind of book I wanted to read, but the inclusion of fat hating essays (by thin people) undermines the power this collection might have had.  Instead I highly recommend Shadow on a Tightrope: Writings by Women on Fat Oppression by Lisa Shoenfielder, et al, or Fat!So? by Marilyn Wann. 
 I don't normally write these reviews, but I feel a responsibility to other readers to warn them away from this book.  If you don't want to know any details about the book, you have the option of not reading this review, but, if you want to know what you're letting yourself in for, read on.  If you are a horse lover, I srongly advise against reading The Horse Whisperer.  If you want a romantic love story, you should also look elsewhere.  If you want insight into dealing with a trauma, so sorry, no luck here.  The book opens with a graphic description of a violent accident involving a girl and her horse, which results in death.  Though I found these scenes truly disturbing, I hoped the trip taken by the girl and her mother to find an expert who could help to heal the girl and her horse would prove redeeming somehow.  Instead, the experience was muddled and pointless.  The few instances involving the "whisperer" attempting to heal the horse from its trauma struck me as something that would further traumatize the poor animal.  Nothing he does ever seems to break through and cause the horse any improvement.  Additionally, the mother appears to have no purpose in the story except wandering aimlessly around the farm, occasionally cheating on her husband with this man, and becoming pregnant with his child.  The book's focus then turns almost completely to this ill-advised affair which doesn't really have any chemistry to it.  The man and the mother don't seem that attracted to each other, and evidently only end up together because the plot required it of them.  During all this, the girl's psychological problems resulting from the accident are basically ignored.  She pretty much drops out of sight until the very close of the book when she is taken by the horse whisperer to witness another graphically brutal occurrence, which ends in another horrific death.  Apparently, what we are to glean from this book is that, if you are a woman who can't have children with your husband, getting knocked up by another man will save your marriage.  If you are a young girl who happens to witness a violent death, nothing will cure you except witnessing another violent death.  If you're a horse, you can just figure things out for yourself.  The fact that everyone seems blissfully happy after all this absurdity, just feels as though the author got bored with what he was writing and figured he had to wrap it up with a Hollywood ending somehow so he could get it off to the publisher quickly.  In the end, I see no reason to waste your time with this book.  I wish I could get back the hours of my life I spent on it.      
 I was so hopeful when I picked this book and was initially pleased settling into the story line.  All the women were about my age and I have faced some of the changes they faced in the story.  Ms. Monroe's characters share their deep losses and challenges on such an intimate level with the reader, but for all the empathy inspired by their revelations when Monroe started folding the characters together, things seemed to fall apart.  The mature, vibrant women I met in the beginning of the story became emotionally limited numbskulls as the story moved along.  Good start, sloppy finish (quickly wrapped up and tied with a big, pink bow, and only a few loose ends).  
 Is this a novel?  The dust jacket says it is, yet i was confused.  For one, the heroine is named Amelie, which is also the author's name.  Another fishy thing was that on page 5 Amelie says: "That's why i have decided to call the company "Yumimoto"..."  Why the name change?  It made me think that Amelie worked indeed for a real corporation, and in order not to get sued, she changed the name.  If this was indeed a work of fiction, why come clean as to the fact that you are giving the company a pseudonym?    This was a super-short book, which i read in just a few hours.  Amelie the character, just like the author (imagine that), was born in Japan, but was Belgian by nationality.  She went to Japan to work after college, and because of her free-thinking mind, initiative and individualism, had to suffer the ignominy of one demeaning job after another.  I was very put off by her admiration of Miss Mori, her boss, who was a sadistic biatch, if you ask me.  I would have strangled her after the first insult.  But that's me.    I have a lot of respect for the writer's craft, and don't say this very often.  But i need to say it now: this novel or memoir or whatever you want to call it was too simple.  I can write something as petty and gossipy as that in no time.  I was very surprised that this book was deemed worthy of Le Grand Prix of the Académie Française 
 George Lakoff's advice and efforts to help John Kerry in the election really worked out well. It's obvious Lakoff is dispensing the same wonderful advice to the DNC Chair Howard Dean. As an Independent conservative I am thrilled with George Lakoff's work. Thanks, Georgie 
 This is merely an introduction to Active Release Therapy and its potential in the treatment of Repetitive Strain Injuries.  There is NO INSTRUCTION on how to apply ART.  Consider it promotional material for Dr. Leahy .  The bulk of the book is made up of an overview of common Injuries (causes, treatment options, selected exercises and stretches). One has to train and test with the author to become an ART practitioner 
 although the usual elements are there--defender of the faithful searching the heart of darkness (his own) at a crucial point in life (middle age); the good-as-gold woman who gets away; the woman who doesn't--sprinkled with stories cops tell each other. But it drags, as if written to a formula not fully developed. Wambaugh writes well, part Hemingway, part Joseph Conrad. But this adventure story for men misses in all but the gastronomical department 
 This film gets 2 stars for good production only. Fans of the book will be grossly disappointed. Anthony Hopkins was grossly mis-cast. It stays too far from the book in order to be an "acceptable" movie and too much is lost and twisted in the conversion. Frankly, I'd think McEwan would have enough money that he wouldn't need to sell out this way. The characters have no chemistry with one another. The ending is ambiguous. For all the "movie" magic weaved in, it lacks drama. A mere phantom of the book. Skip it 
 This scale is a piece of junk!  Every time I would put food on the scale and get a reading, after waiting a few minutes the number would change!  Or I would weigh an apple once and get 6.0.  I would weigh THE SAME APPLE again and get 6.2.  I would weigh it again and get 5.8!  It drove me crazy.  Even when I would zero the scale out, after a few minutes it would show a negative number.  I returned the first one  and asked for a replacement.  I thought it was just that particular scale.  But the replacement scale did exactly the same thing.  Argh 
 I have to agree with the others who gave this book one or two stars. There were one or two patterns that were nice, but when I received the book and looked through the rest, I was very disappointed. 38 out of 40 of the patterns were boring, cheap-looking and beginner-level. If you're a long time, experienced crochet artist, this book is NOT for you 
 The poaching cups are small. It took several tries to learn to make eggs that didn't spill over; sometimes I had egg white in strings all over the machine when it was done. If you buy smaller eggs it helps.    Now that the machine is a year old or so, it has started malfunctioning. The buzzer keeps going off as the eggs are cooking; I think the lid has gotten just warped enough that a seal isn't quite forming? For whatever reason, the machine keeps on thinking it is done, buzzing, and shutting down, so that I have to stand over it pressing down and trying to shift the way the lid fits on. It works well some days and gives me fits other days.  I don't know if we put the parts in the dishwasher or if it's just a troublesome little machine; but if you have multiple family members taking turns washing dishes you may not have control over whether the egg machine gets warped.  When it works, it's a favorite kitchen gadget--and I'm NOT fond of gadgets 
 These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them. I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! These hair growth pills are too damn expensive, so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work. The fact that it does not is infuriating because $39.99 + $7 in shipping, with a total of a little over $46, is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing. Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com. 
 The population of Hong Kong is approximately 7 million people. I'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie. Usually when a movie runs over 2 hours, it's because there's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in. In the case of Hard Boiled, the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by John Woo's desire to get into the Guinness Book of Records for "most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture."  Chow Yun-Fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay, and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff. He shoots (usually with a pistol in each hand) while diving headlong over furniture, while swinging from a rope, while sliding down a banister(!), while being hurled through the air by explosions. Sometimes he even shoots while standing still. And he shoots, and shoots, and shoots. And the bad guys shoot, and shoot, and shoot. And Yun-Fat's fellow cops shoot, and shoot, and -- you get the idea.  There are some fine action scenes in this film, but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended. There wasn't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next, and it became painfully repetitious.   Personally I would highly recommend The Replacement Killers over Hard Boiled. There's plenty of Yun-Fat's balletic shoot-em-up action, but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire 
 It really could have been good.  The story was very interesting.  Unfortunately:  1. It was poorly written.  SO many sentences did not make sense.  I would have to go back and read and reread.  It seems like she was trying to make it more wordy than it needed to be.    2. The characters were not developed.  Except for Caillean.  So I ended up with basically no attachment to the main characters.  Was it really necessary to spend a few chapters on Gaius' career when we don't know jack about most other things in the book?   3. It seems like chapters are missing.  This book should have been longer or had a bunch of half-finished plots left out.  Like the ending.  It seems like the ending was on fast forward.  You might as well read Cliff Notes.  I felt the same way about the end of Mists, too, but this was worse.  4. Can't somone just write a book that is "pagan friendly" yet not all about rape and torture and sacrifice?  All these books are doing is making me hate the Romans and Christians of the time and leaving me with a sense of despair.  I just want one book where they weren't all shown as heathen sacrificers  and the Christians show them how to be civilized, "good people". 
 All of the information in the book could easily be obtained (for free!) from the Amazon Web Services website. In fact, all I learned from this book was that Amazon's online documentation was VERY complete 
 I found that this book was not what I expected.  I was looking for a reference for fine art sketching and painting.  This is more appropriate for graphic art--cartoons etc 
 Perl Pocket Reference only gives lists and tables.  No explanation of how to use the various functions, variables, etc.  Definitely not for new-comers.  I was very disappointed by this pocket reference.  I was expecting something more like the very high quality "Python Pocket Reference", which manages to give complete description of the language, all functions, standard modules, etc, ALONG WITH EXAMPLES FOR EACH; The Python Pocket Reference is able to be used as a standalone reference.  This is definitely not true for the Perl Pocket Reference; You will need other books to make this pocket reference make sense... what a pain 
 Leadbetter turns swinging a club into a bunch of scientific mumbo-jumbo that I cannot apply to my own game 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
  Jackson likes money. And he is not content with his usual repertoir, but also capitalizes on human emotions by releasing the pathetic "Where were you..." about the tragedy of 9/11.   He is a sad fellow 
 One need not be worried if liberals are under the bed. However, be afraid, be very afraid, if cancervatives are in the White House ( as the last six years have illustrated in spades...)   Nice kiddie book by the way. Was this tactic borrowed from the Hitler youth movement by any chance?   
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 I bought this with great anticipation.  I was quite disappointed when I got it.  Billy Idol was never one of my favorites.  I don't recommend this one.  Save your money for something else 
 Absolutely worthless!  This overpriced pamphlet has very little worthwhile information.  If I could give it zero stars I would 
 The premise of this book is marvelous and refreshing. Francine Prose believes in close textural analysis alla the New Critics, is horrified by the twin curses of best sellerdom, speed reading and speed writing, thinks creative writing courses are a crock (good for you old girl! about time somebody exposed that racket), and holds with the Greeks that while good writing cannot be taught, it can be learned by emulation of the greats. At long last, I thought, a corrective to all that bad fiction being written today and an antidote to all that book club drivel being fobbed off on unsuspecting readers as great literature. Could this be the book that finally delivers us from the scourge of `hysterical realism' (Rushdie, Pynchon, DeLillo, Franzen, Foster Wallace, Zadie Smith)? It is clear I had high hopes for this book. But I figured anyone who questioned the legitimacy of graduate English studies deserves our respect.  The book had received glowing reviews. But there is so much hype in the publishing industry I rarely purchase a book based on reviews, especially at today's prices. I reserve the book with my library system, and buy it only if it passes the smell test. I waited weeks for "Reading Like a Writer," and while I'd like to report that it was worth the wait, I cannot. After a slogging through three chapters, my heart sank. Despite her love of good writing, Francine Prose's approach to the subject is plodding, humdrum and idiosyncratic. She begins with individual words, then methodically proceeds to sentences and paragraphs in the fashion of a writer of college textbooks. Francine Prose is that curious phenomenon, an accomplished writer of fiction who cannot write interesting prose for sour apples. As you would expect of any disciple of the New Critics, her analyses of great writers are always spot on; but that is not the challenge of a book like this, which is to write ABOUT inspired prose IN inspired prose. A curious irony: here is an author who loves eloquent writing, but who writes about it in only serviceable textbook prose. (Frank Leavis she is not.)  There's a good deal of redundancy in this book. What aspiring writer needs to be told how exquisite the final paragraph of Joyce's "The Dead" is? In contrast, her bibliography of great writers is remarkable chiefly for its eccentricity. I can't pretend to have read all of the titles on her list, and I refuse to dismiss books on the ground that I've never heard of them; but a few of them I do know, and know well. For example, F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Tender Is the Night" is NOT a successful novel, not even close. Don't take my word for it: Ernest Hemingway complained that the book was a thinly-disguised biography of Fitzgerald's rich friends (the Murphys). At the risk of sounding caustically proscriptive, I found Thomas Pynchon's "Gravity's Rainbow" unreadable*. And is "The Perfect Spy" really John Le Carre's best novel? Hardly. It may be a 'literary' success in the conventional sense (it preserves all the Aristotelian unities), but it has none of the cold war drama, lyricism and descriptive poetry of the George Smiley novels. I'm afraid the definitive book on the art of fiction has yet to be written. (And to be fair to Francine Prose, maybe it never will be.)   * For more on the self-conscious zaniness of `hysterical realism' see "The Smallness of the 'Big' Novel: Human, All Too Inhuman" By James Wood, The New Republic, 7/24/2000; and Tell Me How Does It Feel: US novelists must now abandon social and theoretical glitter, says James Wood, The Guardia 
 To the obsessive compulsive shopper who dares not to take the time to view a books' contents, this will be an $ 7.95 plus tax lesson in irresponsible publishing.  Marilyn Werner  has the audacity to think that any of her  thank you writing suggestions would be, at best, acceptable to a bride's  worst enemy.  There is no better way to validate a review than to quote the  author herself . This is a thank you suggestion for receiving a desk set.   "For the past few weeks we have been opening so many  gifts of linen,  crockery, and "frillery" that George's interest has started to  wander.  Then along came your handsome desk set.  You've selected a gift  that appeals so much to both of us." YOU be the judge 
 If you like nurture arguments more than nature, read this book. He actually uses sociopath and psychopath meaning one who is socialized into becoming a psychopath versus one who is born. I don't agree with it, nor do the foremost experts on the subject. If you enjoy sociobiological explanations for rape and murder and psychopathy, then it's probably for you. For those of you who think, however, read Without Conscience by Hare, he is a foremost expert on the subject and doesn't meander through an essay on why he thinks people are psychopaths, but gives portraits of psychopathy and doesn't shy away from the fact that much of antisocial disorder and psychopathy occurs randomly. This is NOT a good book. It's full of irrelevant information and just plain wrong conclusions 
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 I really enjoyed Atkinson's book, An Army at Dawn, and looked forward to this account of American soldiers in Iraq. The book is a bitter disappointment. The author is so anti-Bush that it colors his report right from the start when he talks about how a father of many children dies and for what purpose. Of course most deaths in war are sad. Every writer knows that the lead of a story portends the slant of the story. He bashes Bush and his administration in the subtle ways of the media that leave critics looking bad if they complain. In the first third of the book, he didn't discuss in detail or with sophistication why the U.S. Congress, including many Democrats, approved the war. Nor does he mention how the previous administration thought Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Nor does he mention how the UN sanctioned Saddam 17 times. He mocks the allies by pointing out the small guys. He says the U.S. was basically going alone when Great Britain, Australia, Japan, Spain, Italy and other countries supported the action. These examples go on and on. He puts all the blame on the Bush administration. Let's not forget that Saddam miscalculated badly by not seeking peace terms with his adversaries and he lost his country.  I've only listened to the first part of the book on audio and it's boring. It's more about him the author than about the soldiers. What made them so great? Able to conquer a country the size of California in a few weeks? The Band of Brothers author very well described the rigorous training. Instead, Atkinson's starting point is the Shoney restaurant and all about his problems. The author rested on his laurels as a Pulitzer Prize winner, which probably intimidated his editors and kept them from pushing him to do a great job.   Instead, this book lacks insights into why people did certain things. Like most journalists, he kept close to the leaders so he could file his breaking news. It's another sorry example of partisan media bashing by the top media. See Woodward timing his book to run a month before the 2006 election and the NY Times publisher saying he was sorry he couldn't prevent the Iraq war. It's no wonder that the elite media no longer have the respect of half the country.    Peter   
 N.E.W. and it seems AMAZON have no idea of why there are three prices for the 4-year plan. The only solution that I could find from other reviews is possibly based on the price of the TV, ie when you check the price of a TV and scroll down to the bottom of the page, the price of the 2 and 4 year warrantees will be different for each TV. Based on that price, select either 2 or 4 years warrantee and add to your cart. 
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 Don't be fooled by the advertisments that you see in almost every magazine.  Blitz doens't offer the career mode that it was based around and game play itself is horrible.  The greatest inconvience of the game is the load times.  They are WAY too long. Loading up your profile is an inconvience, loading up to play the game gets annoying and when you finish a game and go to save, you start to think "F*ck this".  The loading time alone will kill the feeling of wanting to play.   Then there is the gameplay itself.  Bone crushing hits?  Please, outside of the occasional dirty hit (which is far easier for the computer to employ on you, than vice versa) the hits look like the early developments of Madden.  The plays are fairly easy until you get to the 4th quater when it seems that everytime the computer magically can score 21 points no matter what defensive strategies you employ.  Then there is the whole steriods issue which is laughable.  Give a player some juice and he misses 3 plays.....conventionally treat him and he misses a quater.  Either way, you'll never miss him.  This game is horrible, from the graphics to the load times.  Save your money and go buy a game that will at least remotely capture your interest 
 I am one of the many reviewers who purchased this DVD because everyone favorably compared it with "Seinfeld," and (not being an HBO subscriber) I had never seen it. Personally, I found this show boring, repetitive, and often grating. Well, that's just me. You might be among the many people who enjoy this genre of comedy. Deciding if this DVD is for you will require an informed assessment of you own taste.  Buy this DVD if you tend to laugh at protracted bickering among the characters (as in "Married with Children" or Vicki Lawrence's show "Mama").  This is NOT the kind of gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering that we once enjoyed in "All in the Family." As in "Seinfeld", you will see adults act in childish, selfish, irresponsible, uncaring ways. Depending on how this is done, it can be VERY funny, but "Curb" missed the mark for me. I find self-absorbed New Yorkers (as those portrayed in Seinfeld) to be funny, but self-absorbed Californians (as in "Curb") are just pathetic, not even laughable. You might feel differently. Neurosis and rudeness are backhandedly ridiculed in "Seinfeld", but almost celebrated in "Curb." The characters in "Seinfeld" are roughly half a generation younger than those in "Curb." The Seinfeld characters (who came of age in the "me" era of 1980s ) commit a variety of hilarious middle-age gaffes and mis-steps associated with a lack of direction in life.  The older characters in "Curb," on the other hand, offer us only a repetitive and uncreative barrage of antagonistic behavior that is characteristic of people who have given up on forging new directions in life. They merely exist. You might find this funny, but I found it depressing 
 I would like to cordially invite Dr. John Gray to visit and work in the public school system, of which many campuses are run exclusively by women. These women can be very matter-of-fact, get-down-to-business and get-the-job-done.  Those gals are there to work.  Some of them try to bond emotionally and some do not.  But they get their jobs done.  They often have to do things they don't "feel" like doing, but they do it and they do it darned well.    I think the best cross-gender communication, whether at work or socially, can be as follows;  1.  Listen as well as talk. 2.  Respect the other person's views. 3.  Don't try to make a psychological statement about another person's style, whether male or female. 4.  Don't hog the limelight. 5.  Respond with empathy. 6.  Park your ego outside the door.  In other words, practice GOOD MANNERS!  It works every time 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 An awful lot of people are making an awful lot of money dishing out what amounts to either common sense or drivel. Here the author requires almost 300 pages to state what could have been said in 5 to 10.  If this is an example of what passes for substantive executive training than heaven help us.  Borrow the book from a library if you must, skim a couple of the pages and you'll have all of it.  Don't waste your money 
 I still have not recieved the item ordered on 2/28 and today is 3/31. I will be waiting and not placing any more orders from there!!!!!!!!! 
 Two stars is the equivalent of a D in school.  D is for dumb, as in the language used in this translation.  However, before it sounds like a personal insult to anyone, the author explains that a more simplistic and less poetic style is what he intended.  and besides, the guy reads chinese.  he clearly isn't dumb.  Nevertheless, i like the poetic style that other translators have used.  Sun Tzu's concepts are timeless, and they could hardly be seriously damaged by an unorthodox translation, but i personally find the poetic style more accessible.  the primary reason for this is its beauty.  beauty is more easily recalled than blandness.  it is easier for me, and many others i suspect as well, to remember beautiful language.  the purpose of beautiful language is to express the ultimately inexpressible.  simple "how to" language fails to do this because it lacks beauty and is utterly pragmatic...that is to say, it lacks a personality and is usually forgetable.  Sun Tzu's work, as my reading of it goes, is less of a 'how to fight a war' as it is 'artful expression of power-relationships'.  the title says it all: "the ART of war"  not "war for dummies"        (though, come to think of it, that would make a catchy bumper sticker).  Artful expression was sun tzu's ultimate intention, and the spirit i believe he held when compiling this work.  "plain english" does a disservice to this spirit of artful expression.  Societies have always suffered when the sublime is sacrificed upon the altar of clumsiness.  Go for the poetry instead. 
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 I found Claire Dolan to be a bleak, sad and depressing portrayal of a woman trying to earn money to may off a debt by selling herself to wealthy business men. Not only did Katrin Cartlidge (Claire Dolan) not have any depth to her role, but I found her terribly unappealing. She only had one facial expression through out the entire movie, even when she was having sex. She showed no feeling or emotion. Granted, some of the dullness to her character was due to her role, but it seemed as though there was nothing underneath.  Vincent D'Onofrio was the saving grace of this film, playing Claire's love and pseudo-savior. He carried the entire cast, along with the very talented Colm Meaney. This movie is an OK choice for any fan of Mr. D'Onofrio's, but other than that, i found the film to be very boring and slow moving. 
 This CD fell far far below my high expectations of Sting.  I found it unimaginative, sounding much like many of his earlier pieces 
 seriously bad...she sounds more like a motivational speaker for [...] women than she does a comic. I watched this last night high-as-a-kite and did not laugh at a single thing...that's never happened before. Had I been sober I wouldnt of watched it at all. TERRIBLE 
 This is just one of those dvd's you wouldn't mind renting for family night with the kids. It's not scary or entertaining except for maybe (emphasis on maybe) She Bear. The reason this may be considered funny is because it's so lame. Like one of those B-movies that is so badly done that you can't help but laugh 
 Mogambo is an inferior re-make of the 1932 film Red Dust starring Clark Gable in the role he reprised here. Taking Mary Astor's place as the wife of an anthropologist (Donald Sinden) is Grace Kelly and replacing sexy Jean Harlow as a loose visitor is Ava Gardner. The film is set in the wild of Africa where animals roam free. Gable is a trapper who craves danger and shuns too much civility. However, he is transformed by the beautiful visitor despite the fact that she has a husband, and she becomes smitten with him. Feeling used and disposed of, Gardner wisecracks constantly about the chemistry between the two, and is hurt by their relationship.   This film is much longer than the original version and there is absolutely no chemistry between the cast. Kelly seems wooden and bored with the part and walks through it with a stuffy grace that is hard to be endeared to. Gardner tries hard, but she's more annoying than fun. She also has a hard face which makes her less attractive than the part calls for; her personality does not make up for this. Gable is the best, but even he lacks energy. He hardly emotes anything and his few bursts of feeling seem forced.   Even the scenery cannot save the film. It is a chore to sit through 
 HAVE NOT SEEN THE TEXT YET TO RE 
 This is a novel about a professor who is slightly cuckoo.  This is a story about a man who is filled with opinions that can not only be considered conservative for our time, but did for his time as well. I used this novel to exercise my Nabokov, and is my least favorite novel by the author.  I am glad he wrote others, because this alone would have stolen Nabokov's artistic genius.  The book is written well, but the plot is immensely boring.  I would suggest you NOT bother reading it. 
 this book is the devil! i am using it in a lit studies course and loathe every second i waste reading these essays. they seem to be written mostly by stuffy university professors who are attempting to sound like they know what they are talking about.  It is not a dictionary, nor does it help the reader properly understand a term.  If you are curious about a word that is discussed in the book, i suggest looking it up in the dictionary.  it's easier. and you'll actually learn what the word means without having to search through thick sentences that really make no sense and large words that you know the author just pulled out of a thesauraus 
 People should be aware that the original Italian run for 14 hours. Considering that any buyers of this item are surely an opera and Verdi entusiast seaking real information, will be shortchanged with this set. The version once presented by PBS few years back, was 10 hours. First, the movie is from 1984 for those inquiring. And YES it is posible to have a superb transfer to DVD. With 11 hours (still shortened), no Burt Lancaster and excellent video and sound (Dolby Digital 2.0). Just secure the transfer from Euromedia Vision (c/ Diputacion 288 bajos, 08009 Barcelona. www.euromediavision.com). English (BBC/male) and spanish. Seven DVD. One problem for most of you which do not have an all-regions/all-systems DVD player, is that the set is Region 2 and PAL. There is only one thing wrong with this set. At the completion of episodes 2 to 6, they actually use only the credits of the 7th episode only, thus depriving us of the information of who sings what. Not nice. There are three episode in Verdi's life that I regret were not presented. 1] The pre-premier delivery of all the music parts (including the tenor) of La donna e mobile, to prevent the leaking of such contagious tune by musicians and workers. I can only imagine the stress. 2] The missed early oportunity of even a glance betwen Verdi and Toscanini, in the second chair of the cellos at La Scala orchestra during rehersals and premier of Otello. He eventually saw him conducting, recommending him to the baritone Maurel, who recomended to Leoncavallo, eventually resulting in Toscanini conducting the premier of Pagliacci. 3] His role in 1899 as arbitrer betwen tenor Tamagno (original Otello), in favor of Toscanini, about tempis. Well, I suppose you can't include everything, but we can hope for a "director's cut"......of the italian original 
 Ooh Dear Seth - what happened?  This book is an extension of purple cow, perhaps the bits he failed to add. Plain and simple it is anecdotal at best with no facts to back up his assertions and at worst it is simply another way of financing his vacations to Europe.  Seth's recent books are rapidly shrinking in size with less and less to say, if you are a Seth Fan (I used to be until he started churning out half-baked books without substance) pick up a second hand copy. Seth talks about holding off marketing slight improvements and waiting until a substantial customer driven Free prize emerges. Well Seth take some of your own medicine and bring us a new book with pages, content and a few facts to back up your ideas.  Disappointing...      
 While I found the book useful I would NOT recommend it to a beginner as it assumes you know how inductions & scripts work....and while it gives ideas & suggestions... It gives NO scripts or fundamentals. And while it touches on many topics, it covers none very well. The book lacks structure, focus and clear direction 
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated.  The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting.  Likewise the tale.  The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades 
 For someone with apparent credentials to write about the life of Jesus, Borg shows an amazing ineptitude. He claims "What was his [Jesus] message? Most centrally, it was about himself: his own identity as the Son of God, the saving purpose of his death, and the importance of believing in him. (p. 2)" EXCUSE ME. What Gospel has he been reading? The Gospel According to Paul, I think, which is no gospel at all. The perversion of the message of Jesus with the message of Paul is one of the great crimes on the past 2000 years, and Borg's own Christian background appears to have influenced his thinking here. Jesus' message, if I have to remind him, was about love for each other and for ourselves. Yes, and he had some stuff to say about loving God and following the law.   As if misunderstanding Jesus was not a sufficient cause to never read this book, Borg spends far too much time talking about himself. Quite frankly, I don't care.  I'm also highly suspicious of anyone who talks about the "Jesus of Nazareth" without brackets, because it has become apparent to anyone who studied archeology, Josephus, the Old Testament, the Talmud, and virtually any other piece of contemporaneous Christian literature that the town of Nazareth didn't exist until after Jesus' death. Any scholar who still speaks about Jesus of Nazareth (instead of Jesus the Nazorene, which is the proper translation) is no scholar at all 
 I purchased this product for my 3-year-old grandson on his birthday.  He played with it for about 15 minutes when we decided that it was a little old for him and we would wait a few months before letting him play with it again.  While in storage, both tracts that make the Excavator go forward and reverse broke.  Because of the time that passed, understandably, I had no recourse.  What a disappointment for a toy that had so much potential for fun.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TOY UNLESS YOU HAVE $60.00 TO WASTE IN 15 MINUTES 
 People will believe anything.  This book is full of proposperous claims, and scientifically impossible devices.  The idea of a 9V battery "zapping" parasited deep in body tissues is most ridiculase.  Last time I checked, the skin was quite an insulator.   The book has no hard facts to back up all the claims.  Where are the many people that are cured from these cancers and even HIV/AIDS.  There are none, because the only diaganosis cured were tested by some hocus pocus in the quacks private practice.  No medically diagonosed cases have ever been cured by this money grubbing con aritist.  The book tries to generate fear about being contaminated by everyday living.  The cure, send money for off the wall products and supplements with no quality control packing.  If you would by the brooklin bridge, this book is for you 
 I didn't find this book especially helpful. It seems the author could not decide who her target audience is: is it middle aged women who make $100K a year or 23 year old women making $25K?  I also didn't think the financial advice was nearly as interesting or helpful as books written by finance professionals; the author is a therapist by training.  It also seems that much of the advice is for women who are entirely passive, and I'm not sure most women fall into this category (I certainly do not.)  Save your money 
 I was forced to read this piece of garbage in the early 1980s and am surprised that my co-reviewer offered five stars.  While Prof. Becker's theories may be stimulating to the Nobel Academy and his Chicago disciples,  I found his conclusions vapid and unfulfilling 
 This book is by far not about, as the title suggests life in his brothers shadow,as much as it is about life in his fathers shadow, or the shadow of a defeated Germany!   Herr Timm seems to be searching for his personal share of Germanys collective guilt. The writings of his brother might at most contribute 1 full page to this book! Herr Timm seems to be full of self-pity calling himself over and over again "the afterthought" where I would think his father instead planned him to be his brothers replacement. My father grew up in this same Germany and I have good insight into his thinking. I would suggest because of Herr Timms fathers position he knew a war would happen, and most likely consume his oldest son, that is what brought Uwe into being, not some accident or afterthought.Also his insistance that the 3rd. SS was an elite unit that the camp guards were drawn from is also a factual error. The 3rd SS began as the "Totenkopfverbande" they were the camp guards before the war! After the Polish and French campaigns they were re-organised into the Totenkopf division. The original members and leaders of the organisation Todt were all involved in the German camp system, not as Herr Timm suggests "elite soldiers from which guards were drawn" but rather camp guards that were formed into a front-line fighting unit!Herr Timm also wants to take small obscure entries in his brothers diaries and contort them into some evil or sinister act! A louse hunt is a louse hunt plain and simple, fodder for my MG is just an expression of the daily exposure to the horrors of front-line service. Herr Timm is searching so hard, it seems also hoping to find some act of brutality or inhumanity that he might link to his brother as to justify the feeling he has inside of himself! This book is a waste of time if you are seeking 1st hand accounts of the war, but if you want to read of the guilt placed on the German people and the effects of defeat on a family and country, it might be of some helpful insight 
 I bought this for one of my children but it is a bit heavy and too spongy, severly lacking speed.  I also bought the Stiga Champion which is lighter and faster.  I would spend $6 more and get a paddle which helps play instead of hindering it 
 Although I am not a veterinarian, I have worked in an animal hospital for two years.  First of all, according to our medical practice, this book gives some bad nurishment advice!  Milk (and milk products such as cream and half & half) are NOT a good food for many cats.  Their systems are often not equipped to digest the enzymes found in cows' milk.  Having said what was foremost on my mind, I am also very disappointed in the "behavior" advice from this author.  I found very little information on kittens.....and almost nothing useful (which is why I purchased this book in the first place!).  In fact, I absolutely disagree with Ms. Wilbourn's suggestions about introducing a new kitten into an adult cat home.  From the new kitten arriving via "escort" to you (as the responsible owner) and leaving the new kitten to fend for itself all afternoon, as your adult cat "takes care of himself and his kitten".  What dangerous nonsense this is!  Stop and think.....what a 10 lb. adult could do to a 2 lb. kitten, if so inclined?  Perhaps the cats in Manhatten are far more anthropomorphisized (as opposed to Ms. Wilbourn's coined word "catsonality") then the felines with which the rest of us are familiar?  For the record, I currently have a terrific 15 year old, as well as a very feisty 4 month old.  I should have seen warning signs when this 224 page (LARGE print book) began with a 19 page forward.  No doubt this forward is intended to demonstrate Ms. Wilbourn's considerable knowledge.  Sorry, it doesn't.  Bottom line?  Save your money and try another author....preferably someone with the letters D.V.M after his or her name 
 EDIT:  I made a few of these recipes.  YUM!!!!  I still can't use most of the recipes because I don't know what I am making and the recipes ARE complicated, but I have made three of them and they are delicious!  I made the tapenade and people said it was the best tapenade they have EVER tasted!  I change it to four stars because the recipes taste so good.  Not five because it really is still overwhelming.  Original:  I bought this cookbook because I wanted to learn how to cook healthy mediterranean food.  I have opened the book several times and thought about starting a recipe but every single time, I close it and decide not to because there is sooooo much information and no pictures to tell me what I am making!  There are a ton of recipes (good, I am sure), but it's just way too overwhelming.  I was deciding between this book and another mediterranean cook book.... I'm very sorry I bought this bulky thing.... I wish I woulda gotten the other.... 
 This is without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever read.  You need to take notes to understand it.  It is very disjointed; it feels like a bunch of different chapter articles bound together in book form. It deals with a fascinating subject; it is a pity that it was not better written because it could have been an excelent book.  This may be the fault of the editor rather than the writer; she certainly needed some expert help with making her chapters fit together in a cohesive manner 
 This book is laid out for the absolute novice.  Considering Sammon's long career in photography, I am really very surprised that this book does not have any inspiring photographs.  Many of the lessons are repetitive - the same photos are used for various lessons and the same techniques are mentioned over and over again (i.e., photos - Hearst castle, Amazon Indians; techniques - nik Pro filters, Photoshop curves).  And some lessons are almost unnecessarily inserted on a whim. Sammon has a well-deserved reputation as a photographer, but his take on digital photography does not do justice to this exciting field.  It is an exciting time in photography, and Sammon fails to portray that excitement in his book. I would recommend Tom Ang or the "How to Wow" series of books for better content.  I hope to see a more inspiring book from Sammon in the near future.  
 At first glance, one sees this book and thinks, "what ELSE can posssibly be written about Callas?" Follow your instincts! The cover is beautiful, but inside offers nothing new, with the exception of an evil "friend" readers may not previously have read about (a woman named Vasso). This author does NOT "refute" with any relevant information, that Callas and Onasis did not have a child who died. For the reader who is venturing into the world of Maria Callas for the first time, this is not really a recommended read, as you will not get complete accuracy, and will not find anything you couldn't find in any other Callas book. For Callas officianados, it is a waste of time 
 While the first edition was the seminal standard, I don't see how the second edition can be considered the same.  First of all just look at the back cover, that's glaring.  The numeraters and denomenaters in the differential expressions are reversed from what they should be.   Such things make me hesitant to trust any of the rest of this text.  If nothing else 40 years is too long for a single edition to be used.  McCabe & Smith is about to come out with their 7th edition in since about the same time as the 1st of this one 
 Right-wing media ratcheted up the long-standing conservative complaint that the media is dominated by liberal publications. Though many journalism experts deny that is the case, the image has settled in the American consciousness, forcing newspapers, magazines and television stations to go out of their way to prove they are not liberal. 'We have a conservative media and also a mainstream media, which is also now fairly conservative because it has been forced to deny being liberal.   The Gannon case is a prime illustration. If, during the Clinton administration, a fake reporter from a Democrat front organisation, using a false name, had been exposed as attending White House press conferences it would have been a national scandal. If he had then been shown to be a gay prostitute, the scandal could have threatened a Democrat presidency. With 'Gannon' and Bush there has been no such outcry. The mainstream media has approached the story warily, while right-wing organisations such as Fox News have largely ignored it.  nuff said!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Coelho belongs in a high school creative writing class with this uncrafted chunk of a message on love and religion. Coelho, save me an hour of bored reading and just tell me once again that "love is blahblahblah," with a few mentionings about god 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 Many people have mentioned the embarassing cover art to this book. I agree and it is also very misleading. The characters in the book do not even resemble those guys - the main character's love interest is an artist who looks nothing like the clean cut characters on the book jacket.  Things we can do without in gay fiction from now on:  1. A spoiled egotistical self indulgent main character. Yes this may apply to some gay guys but its just BORING now in the books.  2. A distant disapproving father and eccentric mother. YAWN  3. The flamboyant gay friend (usually black)   First this book starts as a character study - will this selfish debt ridden loser get his act together? - then it morphs into some sort of romance (never worth your time) - then has a whole chapters about the running of an escort service (fairly interesting) and ends with a kind or frenetic black humor. It never gels.  I kept waiting for the big romance and it was incredibly lame. Was my heart supposed to be warmed about him doing threesomes with his new boyfriend and a client????  If you want a real book about running and escort agency read the MAYFLOWER MADAM's book. At least it's interesting.  If you HAVE to read a book about a selfish gay man - I recommend "California Screaming" and forget this trash.  
 I wish someone had warned me -- as I'm about to warn you -- just how lame this movie is.  A low-key, though stylish, story about a mismatched couple whose relationship implodes, this movie finds a tenuous comedic premise in the idea that neither of the ex-lovers is willing to move out of their jointly-owned condominium, and thus are present to torture each other day after day.  She brings home cute guys to make him jealous, he retaliates by throwing sleazy strip-poker parties, and so on.   There are a lot of factors that make this such a lame movie.  In terms of the overall structure, the decision to go straight at the beginning of the movie into the Big Fight that ends their relationship sinks this story right from the start.  We never see them as a happy couple, and never understand why they were attracted to each other, why they were pulled apart, etc.  In short, there's no character development, and no buy-in from the audience -- we just don't care about either of them.  That's a big drawback.  Also, there's no real chemistry between Anniston and Vaughan, and meanwhile the script and pacing are both rather slack... Nothing really clicks here -- the story, the acting, the direction, all blah.  That being said, it wasn't until the very end of the movie that I realized that what the directors were aiming for was a Woody Allen-style character study, a Serious Film.  The first inkling comes when Vaughan delivers his big, serious, take-me-back monologue (which was painful to watch; he was woefully miscast) and the clincher comes in the final scene, where the two ex-lovers meet a year later and have an awkward, um-hi-how-are-you conversation, ala Woody and/or Robert Altman.  In the context of the lifeless film that precedes it, the scene is a dramatic flop (although both actors do reasonably well in the scene itself...) OHHHHHHHH... so THAT'S what they were aiming for!  I get it.  Too bad it didn't work.  Anyway, the short version is: skip this film.  It's a waste of time.  Nice set design, though, and strong cinematography 
 This book is completely shallow. What a horrible hate crime against the rain forest to waste paper on a book like this. The author clearly thinks he's a complete genius but all he is doing is wrapping obvious observations about art and narrative in fancy text and adding artsy-fartst pictures. Spend you're hard-earned money elsewhere!! 
 Battlefield Earth is an adaptation of the book by L. Ron Hubbard.   While the book was a rather interesting story about humans, led by Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, taking back Earth from the Psychlos, the film has turned the story into a string of badly filmed action sequences, with silly camera angles and awful editing. The Psychlos already have human workers before capturing Jonnie. This change in the story serves no purpose but makes the story even more messy. The film then focuses on some of the story elements in the book, but leaves most of it out, including the entire last half.   Considering this was a dream project for John Travolta, it's strange that he would let the book be made into such a bad movie, especially such a silly one. While the book was not without flaws, it was actually pretty good, but the movie is for the most part more or less incompetently made. The director, writers and editors all did a bad job. It does have some entertainment value though, which keeps me from giving it the lowest rating. 
 I've had this and a DVD ordered since January 2nd.  It was supposed to ship today, but they sent the DVD.  I don't understand what is taking so long.  It's a CALANDER 
 It's easier to make one from scratch AND you electricity bill won't skyrocket 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 There might be a good idea for a joke - but it just does not come out funny. That's about all I can say about this amazingly overrated book. Seems to have all the ingredients to be good: Great Ohio Desert (G.O.D) - funny, the names of the people - funny, and so on. Came out to be - just boring. Pretentious dull dialogue. Pretentious dull characters. I was reading it in a morbid disbelief, that lasted for more than half of the book. It is very unusual for me to stop reading a book once I passed the halfbook mark - I usually want to know "what happened". It kept me going here for some more pages - and then I decided: nothing of it really happened, does not matter, waste of time. None of the characters, surroundings or events were in any way interesting 
 seriuosly. now if this was like Greatest Hits Vol.02, i'd get it since i LOVE all the songs on this cd, and it's the only reason i got this album. so thank you very much for ruin real klassics 
 I did not find this book entertaining or informative.  It appears to be a general survey work, lacking in testable theories, and largely the result of data mining.  Terms are loosely defined, and the "Scientific" portions of the data are laughable.  One chart claims to represent "Political affiliation of residents who have primitive art, by their attitude to the art" and, remarkably, people have only two attitudes at all - co-equal with western art, or "disrepect or in Darwinian terms"  Even better, the total who view with "disrespect" was 15 people.  Quite the illustrative survey.  The sort of garbage that gives all liberal arts a bad name 
 The author and the publisher should be embarrassed by this effort. I have only completed three chapters and I am already frustrated by the many topographical errors which, you would think, in a second edition the author or editors should have substantially removed. I do not claim to be an author or book publisher but I expect those who do to maintain a higher standard than presented in this publication. I purchased this book as a learning tool as the book claims to contain many experiments & projects. However, the projects and experiments as presented in the book are no more than hints without access to the author's software source code. The book makes many references to a CD-ROM which is not included; my copy was in unopened shrink rap. The publisher has made the contents of the CD-ROM available on a web site. The sources files are available for download as a PC executable file however it appears that the executable file is faulty. It appears to be a debug version which does not include all of the necessary files. I have attempted to contact the author on two email addresses both returned as unknown and I have also contacted the publisher. The publishers help desk have acknowledged my email but I hold little hope. If you are considering purchasing this book for the source code files that should be included be prepared to be disappointed. 
 Having read other Catherine Coulter novels, I expected this to be along her usual level of excellence.  I was wrong.  In the introduction she states this isn't a rewrite of the novel, just putting it in different clothes -- she should have done some rewriting!  The characterization leaves much to be desired, the hero or heroine don't inspire any empathy, the writing at times feels emotionless (her complete lack of emotional punctuation, such as exclamation points, is an excellent example) and the dialogue is clipped and underdeveloped.  While the idea behind the story is good, the actual story itself is not up to Coulter's standards 
 I was given three months to read this book, and each time I picked it up I threw it down in disgust.  Between the none-stop Johnny Appleseed referances to the Collegian's Guide to Growing Pot, it is amazing I got through it.  I am convinced he was once a Columbian drug lord 
 Like beauty, greatness is in the eye of the beholder. Alan Wolfe's concept of greatness sharply differs from this reviewer's view of greatness. While he claims to be a "Liberal" Kerry voter, he does not promote the classical liberal thought of a Lockean, and is intolerant of other views of greatness.  Rather, like many of today's "progressives" his "Liberalism" is a perversion.  It calls for a strong coercive government that destroys any existence of individualism.  His heros are Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, Abraham Lincoln, Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt.  What makes them heros is that they all succeed in increasing the power of the central government while actively ignoring the true intent of the US Constitution.  The obligations that one has towards his fellow citizens are not self imposed, but are decided by and enforced by a strong central government bureacracy.  Indeed, Wolfe's idealogy is highly nationalisic and intolerant.  It is basically a fascist ideal where the will and the identity of the individual is destroyed.  Greatness (as opposed to goodness) comes from government strength.  Wolfe's desired Leviathan could easily violate the basic freedoms that many have given their lives to defend.  This reviewer believes that both America's goodness and greatness have come from her people, and not from government force or military might.  Without the force of government, the great Americans of yesterday and today freely place restrictions on themselves in order to improve life for themselves and their fellow world citizens. America's great people come from all walks of life. She is a school teachers, business owner, a loving parent, a little league players, or she is just an infirmed lady who can rise above her own pains to freely give some of what little money she has to the tsunami victims in Southeast Asia.  If she were forced to give of herself as Wolfe would advocate, then she has lost her right to be good, generous, and helpful.  Greatness comes from within the individual and can never be imposed by government power.  A country can never be great if its citizens are treated as livestock, and this is the reason that Wolfe's vision fails.  If his vision is ever implemented, the US will go the way of many failed regimes such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and many innocent lives will be lost along the way 
 I believe that it is human nature to not want to read what yuo are forced to read. And i was assigned to read this in my HST301 class at oakland university. But goodness, Mr. Sam Bass Warner is interested in things that I am flat out not interested in. My teacher, for some reason, is just fascinated with the idea of privatism, however all it is is saying capitalism in a different way. I'm sorry I just don't care when Philadelphia put in waterworks and who were great contributors to the city. . .oh wel 
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 Sir Cyril Burt achieved unparalleled results in researching the effects of environment and heredity on identical twins.  Only after his death did it become clear that the alleged research had never happened, that Burt lied to further what he perceived to be a greater truth. Sadly, the possibility must be considered that Milton Erickson did likewise.  Not only do the results he claimed to have achieved involve impossible to believe coincidences and phenomena far beyond anything ever achieved by anyone else.  They also include results that even unshakable believers in hypnotism's real existence concede are unreplicable and should be impossible.  If Erickson really accomplished what he claimed in various medical journals, then he was a miracleworker beyond compare.  Somehow I doubt that. 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 In Stephen  Silbiger's words, "I realised that the basics of an MBA education were quite simple and could easily be understood by a wider audience." What the author is trying to do with his book is to cram in two years of an MBA education into 350 pages. Naturally, the book misses the whole point of the exercise of a University education: it takes time to grasp the often complex models that students will have to master in order to be eligible for a diploma with their name on it. It may be true that a lot of MBA programmes are very repetitive and that the basic information can indeed be summarised into a few pages only, however this means that all the details is missing.  As we all know, MBA programmes are very heterogeneous and will all differentiate at teaching something slightly different, in as far as the subjects are concerned (obviously the contents remains the same for the same subjects). Silbiger's MBA is based upon 9 subjects, where others like negotiation, international business, entrepreneurship, or project management are all summarised into one chapter.   What this book does well, is to emphasise that the main objective of an MBA is to be able to take a global decision within an organisation, that is decide in such a way that no aspect of your entrerprise will be defavoured in any way. However, not only does the book lack in perspective (the author literally bases his this book on his personal educational experience and does not focus at all beyond the US border), but at the same time the contents of this book is very shallow. The great theories are only outlined in very general terms and a lot of detail and further theories that you should expect from a sound MBA, are missing totally. The book is an insult for all those who have actually completed an MBA, by spending one or two years at a constitutional MBA, and puts the non-MBA reader at a very low level.  Thus only the lowest rating can be awarded for this book, as it fails to deliver what it promises 
 After 9/11 happened, I didn't have the stomach to read (or listen to) Stupid White Men.  With the fifth anniversary of 9/11 arriving today, I thought it was time to look back at how we looked before we were attacked.  I have great respect for Michael Moore and had high hopes for the book.    Alas, I was very disappointed.   The book opens on its high point -- Mr. Moore's excellent characterization of how the first W. Bush "election" was stolen.  In the recounting of the "accomplishments" of the administration, you'll be fascinated to know that many of the areas where spending is through the roof now were originally cut back . . . such as areas related to national security.  After that, the only other good section was the one about how racism is based on false beliefs about African Americans rather than personal experience.    For the rest of the book, Mr. Moore indulges in creating "solutions" that have a surface validity for someone who doesn't know anything about what he's describing.  If it were just humor, I would laugh.  But the "solutions" seem to be seriously intended.  For instance, the Middle East will become peaceful if Arabs learn to emulate Gandhi and use non-violent protest methods.  Really?  I wonder if he even knew that there are two groups of Muslims that are routinely waging war on one another.  In other places, I think he was trying to be humorous . . . but it didn't work well enough to be funny.  For instance, the book "humorously" describes the solution for creating peace in Northern Ireland as having all of the Protestants convert to Catholicism.  It just didn't seem funny.      Mr. Moore also prefers to look at every issue from an economic class point of view.  I felt like I was listening to neo-Marxism in places!  Unless you don't know how the first W. Bush election was "liberated" in Florida by Jeb Bush and his compadres, you can skip this book.  You'll think more highly of Mr. Moore if you do 
 Yancey's problem is that he follows fads.  It's like in the movie, Good Will Hunting.  Most of the people studying an issue will follow the latest fad.  That's what Yancey does.  The title, "The Bible That Jesus Read", insults Jesus Christ, who is God -- the Second Person in the Holy Trinity.  The Old Testament and the New Testament clearly teach the Holy Trinity.  Gospel of John chpater 1 shows all Three Persons of the Holy Triity operating.  It is because people like Yancey has taken the helm of Christianity -- he is the editor of Christianity Today -- that America's Christianity is in grave trouble.  Ordaining homosexuals?  What do you think about that Yancey?  Is that a part of the "Bible that Jesus Read"?  Ridiculous! 
 The front material is cheap feeling and grainy.  Also, there is a large plastic gold-colored Cris Notti button adorning the front that does not appear in the online picture.  Otherwise it is functionally useful and of good quality 
 I am a grea fan of rhapsody. The order of goodness of their cd would be this: Legendary Tales: Excelent Symphony of Enchanted Lands: Very Good Dawn of Victory: Good Rain of a Thousand FLames: Good Power of The Dragon Flame: Outstanding (Exelent +) Symphony of Enchanted Lands 2: Unbelivable (Exelent ++) Triumph of Agony:FU&^%*#%^#&$&$^( no vote  This is Rhapsody, this is not any mediocre bands. I could not tolerate those simple rhythms in most of the songs in which the elec guitar just plays two chors, the drums jus do a basic rhythm of bass, bass, snare like on punk music, the bass acompaniying this. where are the guitar solos of luca turili or keyboard solos that you coulf have found in any of the previous CDs. even Rin of the thousand flames is better than this one. On this CD I only recall two good tracks: 3, 11; 12 and 13 which are bonus tracks and which are very good by the way.  But still they are not as good the other CDs songs such as Emerald Sword, Unholy Warcry, Land of Immortals, Power Of The Dragonflame and other.   Oh my god. Track 10 is 16 minutes... OF REPEATING THE SAME MELODY. I remember on power of the dragon flame the song Gargoyles, Angels Of Darkness. that one lasted fo about 19 minutes, and in each sequence they would come up with something different. I got astounded about thet song. I really know how much these guy know about music.  They always have been so creative, powerful, knowledgable about music and so on. I believe they just realeased his CDs because they were on rush  I got the same desception with this CD like when Luca Turilli released    The Infinite Wonders of Creation and Lost Horizon, compared to the greatness of  King of the Nordic Twilight and Prophet of the Last Eclipse.  I apology in the name of the mighty warriors of rhapsod 
 It is hard to know quite what Whitelam means by 'The silencing of Palestinian history'.  He appears to be suggesting that the use of the Hebrew, Jewish bible to reconstruct the history of ancient Palestine was a colonial, western enterprise that has dispossessed modern Palestinian Arab Muslims and Christians of their history.  But the latter have regarded their Islamic or Christian traditions as history, historically, which are derived from the Hebrew-Jewish, 2nd or 3rd hand.  Only Western, European Christians or Israeli Jews were first motivated to dig for their spiritual or ethnic origins since only they had the sources to motivate them.  Palestinian Arab Christians have traditionally seen themselves as descended from the Arabs mentioned in the Book of Acts who heard the disciples' speaking in tongues, Muslims from the Arab conqueror colonists who arrived from the 7th century onwards.  Only the Jews believed that they were substantially descended from the Jews or Israelites of old, only they had the desire to seek their ancestral remains in the deepest layers of Palestine.  The current notion that Palestinian Arabs are descended from the ancient Canaanites is very recent, and has arrisen only after the encounter between Palestinian Arab Christian or Muslim nationalists with western historiography of ancient Palestine.  The Bible may have many flaws, from the standpoint of 21st century historiography, but it is authentically Palestinian.  Whitelam's thesis, however, is authentically Western, as is the modern ancient Palestinian Arab Christian or Islamic narrative he either constructs or implies.  Western Christians, Zionist or Israeli Jews have not dispossessed Palestinian Arab Muslims or Christians of a narrative history they have never had.  On the contrary, it is the contradictions with, or lacunae in the Biblical account, almost exclusively discovered by western Christians or post-Christians, Zionist or Israeli Jews that modern Palestinian Arab Muslims and, to a lesser extent, Christians, have latched onto to create a modern ancient narrative for themselves.  To what extent this constitutes an exercise in the kind of objective, scientific historiography that Whitelam advocates, is a moot point. It could be argued that it is primarily an exercise in modern nationalist ancient mythmaking and certainly more western inspired or influenced than the Hebrew bible, since it is primarily the fruit of Palestinian Arab nationalist need and the discipline of modern, revisionist western ancient Palestinian studies.  The Bible is the oldest indigenous Palestinian tradition that has survived and is thus a unique witness. It is also the only such, with the possible exception of the Talmud. Not only have the Jews uniquely preserved these, these have formed their identity to the extent of no other group. No one has disputed this for the majority of Christian or Islamic history, including Palestinian Arab history.  Whitelam's argument is, I think, very clumsy. Trying to create a modern Palestinian Arab Muslim or Christian ancient history based on, say, the Tel Amarna tablets, or Canaanite artefacts and remains is a highly dubious affair. Until Western Christians or Zionist or Israeli Jews began such excavations, the Bible, and a Greek source, was almost the entirety of knowledge about ancient Canaan.  The Bible is still the largest Canaanite (for that is what Hebrew is), and certainly the only Palestinian text tradition that has survived. This, not Tel Amarna, Ras Shamra or Ugarit, has been the source, direct or indirect, of most Palestinian Arabs' information, and narrative, about The Land in antiquity. And the former have almost entirely been recovered by westerners in modern times.  Constructing, for modern Palestinian Arab nationalist, anti-Zionist-Israeli purposes, a pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionist Jewish anti-Bible does not constitute historiography -except in the sense that Whitelam himself decries.  Moreover, Whitelam also overlooks the fact that the traditional Christian and Islamic narrative, including the Palestinian Arabic, has been that the Jews are a people whom g-d has dispossessed of temple, city and land as a punishment for their sins, specifically the rejection of Jesus and the prophets, by Rome, the original western European empire.  These are the Christian and Islamic meta-narratives that have shaped Jewish experience. You cannot castigate Zionist or any other Jews for acting on the basis that the Jews are, essentially, a nation dispossessed, when that is what most Palestinians have believed for most of Palestinian history.  It is surprising that Whitelam, a lecturer in Biblical Studies should, apparently, be so ignorant of this. The only one genuinely silencing authentic Palestinian history is he, for he mentions not once what most Palestinian Arab Muslims and Christians have, in fact, believed for most of their history.  In fact, the origin of Syria Palaestina, as a province, dates from the suppression of the second Jewish revolt, in 135 CE, when, according to Cassius Dio, 580 000 Jews were slain. Of course, the name `Palestine', as that of `Syria', has been largely unknown to most `Palestinians' until recently, until largely reintroduced into the region by the British or French.  'Palestine' has, historically, been almost the exclusive preserve of western or European history or travel writing.  Before 1947, those who most commonly designated themselves `Palestinian', were Zionist Jews.  The criteria by which Whitelam makes his thesis are most muddled and confused.  It is indisputable that archaeology has greatly nuanced the Biblical picture and, in places, apparently contradicted it (but give the sparseness of remains, that is also a dubious assertion). But it was the Bible that it inspired such an undertaking in the first place. It still remains the only source written by ancient Palestinians that tells us who they thought they were and where they came from. It is incomplete as a source, and, in the end, only excavation can tell us how it arose in the first place. But arise, in Palestine, by Palestinians, it did.  No modern, thoroughly western pro-Palestinian Arab Christian or Islamic anti-Jewish  nationalist anti-Bible will ever change that.    
 Product advertised and then after paying for them they were not available.  Tied up money for over two weeks before refund credited back.  Bad experience 
 ....since she makes him look like the worst man alive. Anecdotes about how she has to beg him to do his part as a father and how he negatively reacts to her pregnancies really set my teeth on edge. Am I the only woman alive whose husband truly cherishes his role as a father? Even worse, I put 2 and 2 together and realized the man in question is none other then THE Jimmy Iovine, famous producer. Is THAT how she was able to get this drivel published? I agree with the previous reviewer who noted the overabundance of run on sentences as well. Don't waste your money on this book:The Iovines have plenty as it is. 
 I absolutely love Janet Evanovich and the Stephanie Plum series, so when I saw this new series of books with her name on it, I grabbed them up.  I couldn't even finish reading this book.  It was so bad.  The whole talking car concept was, frankly, just stupid.  This was like watching an episode of Knight Rider, but without David Hasselhoff.  The characters are flat, and the dialogue is stilted and contrived.  I can only believe that Charlotte Hughes did most of the writing, and why on earth would Evanovich attach her name to this?  Needless to say, I will not be reading the rest of the series.  Spend your money on something worth reading 
 I have read or listened to the entire Cat Who series and this one was a so far off base that finishing is was painful. There was no mystery The 'Barn" is lost almost as an after thought to fill space. I feel that someone tried to pass this off as a Ms Braun's story to meet a number of words requirement.  There was no plot development even close to the of past Cat Who books.  This was on book I wish I had never purchased. 
 Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child.  Although I enjoyed to some degree the psychological portrait of the man, I was very perturbed by the author's contention that the Attorney General in any way engineered his  brother's death.  To suggest such a thing is to suggest pure madness as RFK  was absolutely devoted to his brother and often sublimated his own identity  during his Attorney General years so as to better serve his brother.  I  found that concept preposterous and completely without merit.   Robert  Kennedy was the only one of the brothers that I liked and I believed he had  a lot of personal integrity, moral conviction and certainly a brave one.   He met personal goals and was an extremely hard worker who had a lot to  show for his efforts.  In some way I feel this book trivialized his  political career. Robert Kennedy is an interesting man in his own right and  I think much more interesting than any of his brothers.  I really felt  somewhat disappointed in this book 
 The book, Lipstick Jihad by Azadeh Moaveni is a very interesting and factual book. It tells the story, in first person, about an Iranian girl living in America, and then after college, moving to Iran. But instead of feeling comfortable in her home country, she feels like an American foreigner living in Iran.             While in America, Azadeh only remebers Iran vaguely, and remembers happy times there. Once she moves to Iran, she discovers the country is confused, filled with politics, and in an emotional struggle. She is a journalist and describes the difference between Iranian and American culture, such as womens' rights, and how they clash with each other. She talks about Iran's strong laws people live by, social codes, public etiquette, and the Islamic revolution that changed her country.                                                     This nonfiction book really shows the clash of the two cultures. For anyone who is interested in other countrie, thick government analysis, and how they are run, then this is a great book for that 
 I don't usually criticize a book too badly, but this one just isn't cutting it (or the light for that matter)...it's so basic that if you have any knowledge of basic photographic lighting, don't even bother with this one because it's all repetition.  I wanted to learn about lighting for subject movement and most of this is people sitting on their duffs (which is about 20% of the time)..you can tell the author photographs mostly sitting subjects - he may as well be a still photographer!  And when he talks about onset and offset lighting, he says arrange it until it looks good - nothing is said about broad or short lighting and how it can flatter a thin or round face....He forgot about the most important thing - the subject.  I teach a photographic lighting class, and this would not even be close to the book I would recommend.  If you really want to learn about lighting, buy the book called: Set Lighting Technician's Handbook for film lighting equipment, Practice and electrical distribution by Harry C. Box.  (this is really his name)....Anyhow, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my expensive copy of Lighting for Video - I may use it for my next subject to sit on to raise their elevation for a photo - that's about all it is good for. Sorry, but horrible attempt at giving good examples of real life lighting situations - MOVEMENT ! 
 it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore 
 Monica Keena's colagen lips were bigger than this movie's budget. The acting was decent considering its poor script and dialogue- Way to go Monica. No monsters. No darkness. Heaven and Hell consists of nothing more than recycled scenes. Nothing is scarier than realizing how much time you wasted watching it. There's no deep spiritual realization that everyone else claims. - Overall this film was lame. Rent "High Tension" if you're looking for fright or "Kolobus" for lower budget horror. Both  are great!!! 
 I cannot believe how bad this book is, and I am only on page 94! It is a pointless, rambling piece of garbage. There is no point. Nothing. I am such a huge fan of the movie that I decided to read the book, and I am sorry I did.  The movie moved along at a good pace and was fascinating to watch. It was funny, depraved, interesting and horrorfic.  The book just rambles along.  If you want something that gives ou information on name-brand clothes, restaurants, perfumes, colognes and hair gels and interesting places to visit, this is the book for you. If you are intetested in reading an interesting story, don't waste your time. This book sucks. Go see the movie. Nine out of ten times, the book is always better than the movie - not this one! The book cannot even compare to it 
 I thought I was going to be watching a very special movie based on all of the hype and reviews. I wasn't looking for a Die Hard movie and had no real expectations beyond what I mentioned. I was really disappointed with how disjointed it was and to be quite honest, the lousy acting. The only real joy was Brad Pitt. I don't normally consider myself a Pitt fan, and, I didn't realize he was actually in it. He stands out in this move where I think Bruce essentially mailed it in 
 Pink does a wonderful job casting light on a key part of God's nature...unfutunately the god he describes is Allah, not the God of the Bible 
 This book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every American president. Each individual section includes a brief summary of the president's successes and failures while in office. The "secrets lives" aspect includes a description of his temperament, character and personal habits. For example, John Adams is said to have been vain and irritable, while Frankin Pierce is depicted as an alcoholic. Also much oddball trivia is mentioned, such as that George Washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood.   The biographical information is at least somewhat educational, especially on the lesser known presidents such as Millard Fillmore and Zachary Taylor. But most people who study history will already known much of what is written here. The truth is that O'Brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials. But rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few  books, such as "The Reader's Companion to the American Presidency," and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining. Also O'Brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars.  However, what I found most disturbing about this book is O'Brien's tone and attitude. His so-called "humorous style" is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents, especially those he dislikes. For example, he jokingly suggests that Andrew Jackson had "some unknown frontal lobe damage". I have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president. In fact, I disagree with much of Jackson's presidential agenda, especially his bigoted policies directed against American Indians. However, I also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that O' Brien uses. Overall, I found the book to be juvenile, mean-spirited and overly negative. There are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there. So don't waste your time on this one.   
 THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THIS PUBLISHERS EDITION NOT ABOUT THE BOOKS CONTENT ITSELF.  If you want to know about the content--- be aware that this book is copyright free and in the public domain and you can actually read the entire text free, online, if you are curious about the content of the book and what it is about. I am a person who prefers a real, bound book in the hand to reading on the computer screen or printing off a book onto computer paper.  I learned about this book as it is popular with homeschoolers using the Charlotte Mason method.  This book weaves science content into a story format (narrative format).  About this edition of the book--buyer beware!  I am very annoyed. I saw that Amazon sells three different publishers' versions of reprints of this very old book, before I purchased the book from Amazon.  Of course I am mad at myself for making a mistake, but I am also not happy with the way Amazon markets this Kessinger Publishing's version of this book.  I have had issues in the past with facsimile reprints of antique books sometimes being very hard to read. I took time to research this. I wanted whichever publisher's version has a readable font that is clearly printed.  The way Amazon presently has this item (book reprinted by Kessinger Publishing) set up on their webpage, I thought I was looking inside this book. Imagine my surprise when the book arrived and the printing itself is horrible! I can't stand to read this! Upon double checking this now, I see I made a simple mistake--if you don't want to make the same mistake that I made please read on...  It appears that this Kessinger Publishing version is a facsimile reproduction of the original. The old font type is hard to read. But the more problematic thing is that the ink is blobby and uneven. Specifically, I mean that some parts of the letters are missing (there is white space) while others are blobbed so that the letters don't look as they should, they are black blobs in some parts. I would prefer a book whose text is clearly visible. A modern font is also usually easier on the eyes.  I am very annoyed as this is not even the cheapest price edition of this book which is currently in print! Come to find out there are cheaper versions with nicer and easier to read font!  I am upset with Amazon additionally as the way they have this set up to "look inside this book" brings you to the edition published by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" which has what looks to be a great font, a nice, clear, modern font and a good printing job. (Also today I received a different book purchased from Amazon by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" and it is a wonderful printing job and a a nice binding to boot.  I will be returning this book to Amazon. Too bad I have to pay the shipping to return it to them! 
 The recipes in this cookbook aren't simple, nor would I call this "home cooking." The ingredients required for some of these recipes are diverse and very, very gourmet-oriented. Truffle oil is often mentioned, for example. This is not to say that the recipes are bad, but if you're looking for easy, simple recipes, this is not the book to be buying 
 By any standard, Wayne Barrett's "investigate biography" of Rudy Giuliani is an incredible disappointment.  After weaving my way through  this political hit job, I have a hard time finding anything positive to  write about it.  In retrospect, I should have realized that this would be a  whiny smear campaign when I first saw the book's cover.  The book's title  is "Rudy!  An Investigative Biography of Rudy Giuliani."  This  gives the impression that the author has done some hard-nosed investigative  work that will alter the reader's impression of the protagonist.  After 500  pages of political fury, we only have two tidbits of gossip to satisfy our  appetite.  First, Giuliani's father was briefly imprisoned for robbery a  decade before the mayor's birth.  Second, Dear Old Dad also hung around  some shady mafioso characters.  Some investigation!  If every person is  disqualified by the indiscretions of their relatives, every public figure  from Ronald Regan to Bill Clinton, from Oprah Winfrey to Steffi Graf, would  be forced into early retirement.  This is journalistic guilt-by-association  at its worst.  And sadly, these are the worst accusations that Mr. Barrett  can hurl at the mayor.  But this book claims to be more than an indictment  of Giuliani's family.  In the introduction, Mr. Barrett reveals far more  about himself than he ever does about Mayor Giuliani.  The author claims  that he and Rudy were once good friends but "when he left law  enforcement for politics, our relationship changed.  I never had another  meal with him...I became more and more critical."  After only seven  paragraphs, what purports to be an objective biography loses all of its  credibility.  "The book clearly has a point of view," writes  Barrett.  Sadly, that's about the only thing he DOES get right in the book.   Mr. Barrett could have written about the political and social changes that  have swept New York City in the 1990s and Mayor Giuliani's important role  in them.  But that would be too academically serious and too damning to his  liberal ideology.  Instead, according to Barrett, "race is at the  heart of Rudy's story."  This comment is absolutely outrageous.  As a  young man, Mayor Giuliani was a strong supporter of the civil rights  movement and no one - not even Mr. Barrett himself - has claimed that Rudy  is a racist.  The only race crime that Giuliani has committed, in the  establishment's eyes, is that as a white man he beat David Dinkins, an  African-American, in the 1993 mayoral election.  Years later, following a  dramatic cut in the city's crime rate, Mayor Giuliani was asked for his  most important legacy regarding the black community.  His answer: more of  them were alive.  In other words, the 1,000-1,5000 fewer deaths of  African-Americans during his tenure is a mark of his service.  This was  denounced as an insensitive and even racist comment by liberal ideologues  like Mr. Barrett.  Why?  The mayor believes that the actually lives of  African-Americans is more important than symbolic political acts like  paying homage to Al Sharpton or repeating the old script of supporting  affirmative action.  That comment more than anything should reveal the  logic of New York's liberal establishment: the actual lives of  African-American children are disposable in comparsion to the political  theatrics that win votes on Election Day.  Letting liberals feel good about  how virtuous they are is more important than good public policy.  And under  Mayor Giuliani, New Yorkers have been the beneficiaries of good public  policy.  The crime rate is down more than 60% since 1993, the streets are  cleaner and safer, budget deficits have turned into surpluses, and there is  a new optimism regarding the city's future.  Mr. Barrett wants New Yorkers  and others to believe that the crime drop is a mirage, that the city isn't  cleaner or better-run.  As a resident of New York, I'm not buying it.  And  neither should you.  There's nothing more maddening for an ideologue that  the success of a politician with whom he disagrees.  Mr. Barrett could have  written a book ten times its length and it still wouldn't convince anyone  of anything.  I'm just disappointed that I wasted my time.  Don't waste  yours 
 I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first.  But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.    My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda.  The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught 
 It began nicely with a grandmother telling the story of how it began in their tribe.  I contributed the fact that it was being told by another character to reason for the quick pace of the story and the lame language.  The story continued though with mild language in the simplest of forms.  The story was very faced paced and could easily be noticed that a man wrote this book.  The entire village located in a paradise where killing was not necessary and everyone ran around naked and had sex whenever and with whomever they wanted and jealousy was never an issue.  The entire village was soon destroyed by a natural catastrophe and all that remained was one boy and seven women, all who were sisters.  Each woman paired with him and each had children.  It had the whole Adam and Eve thing going on which is completely wrong for the type of book that it is.  This is way before Christianity and like beliefs.  It was a time of spirits and earthen ways.   Within the first 50 pages every woman had already birthed a child.  Without problems, the people learned to hunt and quickly developed new words.  They learned quickly to develop knives without painstaking labor and frustration.  There were hardly any conflicts that the people of the story didn't quickly overcome.  The story flowed so swiftly that before I read even 100 pages most of the children were grown.  No personalities were developed very well.  The Arthur told you who it was and that was it.  There was no beneath the surface look at the characters.  To put it simply, the story was very blah.  The story ran too quickly to get an idea of the surroundings and the events happening around them so you could never step inside and really become part of the story.  I had to put it down and find something else.  Maybe it gets better I don't know.  I will probably go back to it when I have ran out of other prehistorically fictions to read.  Try a Charlotte Prentiss, Jean M. Auel, Sue Harrison, Linda Lay Shueler, or a Gear's couple book, William Sarabande or see one of the other books in my reviews.  This one is definitely one of the worst ones I have read.  It would have been better if the author took its time developing the surroundings, characters and the events so that the reader could visualize it.  This book could have lengthened itself to several books, which would have made it much better in my opinion 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I searched George Duke because he was on the piano for Jean Luc Ponty's Live at Donte's Hollywood session in 1969. What an awesome bop stylist! But what did I find? Schmaltzy pop. Go back in time for this guy's best stuff 
 This book is about an individual who obviously has a lot of imagination. Unless you intend to consider this as a fantasy novel, I would strongly recommend against wasting your money on this piece of propaganda. 
 I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.  I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
 I was so excited to find a Leon Uris book that I had not read, th I was eager with anticipation. I got about halfway through the book before I became so disgusted that I had to put it down. I thought, "is it that I'm prejudice because don't agree with his politics which are so blantanly displayed in the novel, or is this book as incredibly poorly written as I feel it is?". I checked on this sight (too bad I didn't do that first) and saw that my opinion was indeed echoed by many other reviewers. I love Leon Uris and have read all of his previous novels - some twice. Do not waste  you time on this drivel. It is poorly written, the characters are unrealistic and it is frankly, boring.   For those of you who have never read Uris, I suggest you stick with his other novels. As many others have said, I question whether he actually wrote this garbage 
 OK - I went into this book hoping it would be a James Michener-type epic with sweeping characters and a grand sense of the rich field of Middle Eastern history since World War II. What I got was a romance novel about 3 men's boring love lifes and their boring affairs with a little war thrown in for spice.   The book starts out well but becomes hopelessly sappy. In addition, I was irritated that the story was told exclusively from the Israeli point of view (undoubtedly since I was hoping for the more-inclusive Michener-type approach). I stopped reading about halfway through.  My grade: F 
 Lots of dramatic images, just watch it muted.  The narrative is merely one long whine, and more often than not misstates details.  Shows numerous clips with no explanation or description given.  VERY short on details, long on opinion 
 I bought this item for my daughter and was thrilled how much she used it to make terrific, healthy smoothies.  But after 5 months, the motor died.  I decided to buy a replacement because my daughter enjoyed it so much, and the new one doesn't even turn the blades.  Great idea, but they need to work on the quality and durability 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
 My husband, who has difficulty hearing, and I tried to watch the first episode and couldn't because the sound was not very clear.  These tapes DO NOT have closed caption so we had to sell them before we were able to watch them.  It even seemed to me, and I have excellent hearing, that the sound wasn't that great.  
 This book is very slow moving. You must be truely concerned with the matter he is talking about to actually understand or even want to read it 
 Minotaur initally grabbed my attention. The movie was set in a remote village, and the characters, setting and acting had me hooked. I really liked the film until the youths were taken away to be sacrificed.   Once at the "evil kingdom" and by the minotaur pit, the movie fell apart. The movie became cheesey, with near endless scenes of the evil bad guy sniffing gas from a skull. Yawn. Enough already. Bad acting. Over acting. No care for the characters. Etc.  I thought this movie had a lot of potential with the setting and theme, but sadly it flopped. I've seen worse movies, but that doesn't mean I would recommend Minotaur. If you are looking for something off the shelf that you haven't heard of, but that is good sci-fi, try the Triangle, Firefly or Serenity.  The Scifi has put out many, many quality movies, but sadly this is not one of them. One more comment: one reviewer compared Minotaur to Aliens. That is like comparing the Godfather to Ishtar, Gigli, Battlefield Earth, or Pee Wee's Big Adventure. I encourage you to watch both and judge for yourself.   Total Score (out of 100) = 21  10 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film. 3 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting? 3 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story? 4 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?  1 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting? 0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase

 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 Shytty lyrics followed by half decent beats and horrid vocal work = Freek Show. The only song that slightly interested me while listening to this trash was People Are Strange which is a DOORS cover. Wanna waste your money on immature lyrics.. Purchase this cd.. if not then go look else where..  Freek Show.. Hardly.. More like annoying. 
 Wow. A right wing view of Bush's war efforts with blinders added. Woodward's aim at terrorism is as bad as Bush's. Bush does not deserve to be on any pedestal 
 I was very disappointed with the book. The best picture is of the cover. If you like 80's design, this is the book for you 
 Improbable people in implausible situations driven by too-convenient motivations.  A thin veneer about anthropology, development, political philosophy, and Africa that drags the story along but does little to enlighten.  Obviously written with a well-thumbed thesaurus at hand, the author's vocabulary use is more tortured than inspiring.  (Or, as Mark Twain put it, "it grates on the fastidious ear.")  A decent plot, but a snoozer in its execution.  The characters are drawn with multi-layered histories that are informational but exact no empathy.  
 Considering that it is a book coming from the western world & from a citizen whose country is the godfather & mother of the State of Israel it was pleasing to find that someone recognizes the achievements, to a certain extent, of the Arab armies during the 6th of October War, i.e. the Egyptian & Syrian armies. Especially, during the first few days of the war, when the Israeli's were in disbelief of what was happening to them.  The idea of making a story out of the events where you can relate to people who were involved at the family & personal level, dismissed the book from being a factual documentary, & I think that was the intention of the author in the first place. Maybe he would like one day someone to make a movie out of this book, which would be a good idea. A similar love story, to Yosi & Nati, should have been added but on the other side of the canal, to hide the bias a little bit. However, there are a lot facts that the author omitted that must have been added. The author shows the Israeli's as fierce fighters, who were able to turn things around, on their own. This is completely far from the truth, & is very misleading to the reader. He should have explained that without the Air Lift operation that the USA started, the war would not have turned around in the direction it did, in the Israeli's favor.  The US satellite reconnaissance that was able to provide the knock out punch, that lead to the encirclement on the Egyptian Army in Suez, was completely omitted, & I don't know if that was intentional or because of the lack of knowledge by the author of these actions by the USA. It should have been made very clear to the reader that the survival of Israel, & may be the whole area, since the Israeli's were going to use their nuclear arsenal as a last resort, was immensely effected by the American interference to help its sister state.  The breach of the cease-fire, which is an Israeli habit, must have not been omitted from the sequence of events, as it gave the Israeli's more territories on the Egyptian side after they crossed the Suez Canal, to put them in a better position at the negotiating table, after the cease-fire.  The chess games that were played between the US (Kissinger), the Russians & Sadat, that may have led Sadat to make the huge military errors that he did, were also omitted. (Intentionally or not)  Did Kissinger fool Sadat during that time to make these mistakes & give the Israeli's a military edge to force a stand still, which developed to a cease-fire & later peace talks. Was he threatened by Kissinger that the Israeli's were going to use Nuclear Weapons  & destroy the whole area & decided, instead of stopping the war pre-maturely, he was going to impose on his Generals taking foolish military decisions & force a turn around to the war & eventually to a stop, so that Israel could save a little face, after the embarrassment that it was put in.  Why didn't Sadat listen to his Generals about the consequences of developing the attack, or even in preventing & dealing with the Israeli crossing to the east bank of the Suez Canal. These decisions need to be deeply questioned to find out their motives that were behind the scenes.  Was this a game by the two super powers at the time & the only sufferer would be the fathers, brothers, sons, cousins & brave men who died as a result of irresponsible decisions taken by men in power. `Power is the greatest aphrodisiac' Kissinger was said to have once said. The role of Ashraf Marwan will never be known to anyone, maybe until another 20 years, or until the time of his death, when his memoires or personal diary surfaces. Overall, it's a good novel, but I was not too impressed with the quantity of facts that were over sighted & chosen to be forgotten. You cannot rely on this book on its own to know what happened during the 6th of October War. You need to do your own homework from several other sources. 
 I find myself rehashing my own reviews at this point but nonetheless, I aspire to write a review on each instalment.  Producers have tested logistics to new levels by taking Jason on a murderous vacation to New York.  The film begins on Camp Crystal, where two teenage lovers are discussing the legend of Jason.  Whilst they speak of him, Jason is electrocuted (again) back to life by the contact of the boat's anchor.  More conveniently, he finds a hockey mask on the boat to cover up his unsightly face.  Cue two dead teens with very bad gory effects and Jason's off on his way to New York.  Cue once again a series of brutal murders on the boat, with female heroine Jensen Dagett avoiding him at all costs until he reaches New York shores.  As a side story, the heroine has had previous contact with Jason when she is swimming in the water so she is frightened of the water as a result.  At this stage, a change of scenery was needed but it doesn't work well at all.  What's so scary in New York?  Comedy is used to no effect in this movie and again the death scenes are more elaborate.  Can this unlucky lady stop Jason in his tracks one more time? Will this beast ever die? I rest my case 
 The book is laid out in a very logical fashion and includes answers to all the basic questions a boxer in training has.  Very detailed and practical.  Also very motivating.  A must have source for new boxers or boxers looking to kick it up a notc 
 I bought this book a week after becoming engaged; I have not opened it since. It is outdated and offers no real life suggestions on how to plan a wedding. I have since created my own wedding planner. I've gotten some great planning advice and suggestions from Bride magazines and friends. I would advise anyone against purchasing this book. Maybe there are other planning books that are useful, but I wouldn't take the chance of wasting my money, again 
 I got this book to check out how Dana Joy's book is like.  The answer is I will not read another of her books.  I was so disoriented and had such a hard time focus I had to give up a third way through the book.  The storyline is awful. I would have assigned 0 if I could.  Sorry.  Julie Garwood and Judith McNaught are my favorite writers.  It's hard to find anyone else as good as them 
 The Edith Wharton novel this movie was made from was beautifully written, sensitive and poetic. While this movie was visually appealing and faithfully rendered the story, the performances of Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz were painful to watch. Ms. Anderson especially, while a great beauty, so overdid her lines that I was reminded of high-school plays that I've seen. For emotion or drama, she spoke moreloudly. Her lines were raced through, and punctuated by strange words being stressed. And while she was trying to be distraught, or betrayed, or vulnerable, her face showed no emotion at all. A little bit of eye-brow raised, or pouting lips, but that was all. Eric Stoltz was little better. I couldn't help feel that Ms. Anderson was out of her depth as an actress. Bur Mr. Stoltz, who I've seen in many good roles, was inexplicable. Maybe it was the directing that failed them.  This was so disappointing to me, as I had really wanted to enjoy it, and I had so enjoyed "The Age of Innocence," with Winona Ryder, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daniel Day-Lewis. But this production, from a superior book, really fell short. I would recommend the PBS version, with Geraldine Chaplin, if it were in any way available 
 The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
 A friend tried listening to this on tape, and she couldn't listen to it.    It's a failure in two media 
 I have been a trainer for many years, and am currently working towards becoming a behaviorist - and I can tell you that Paul Owens offers nothing new to the world of dog training. This book is an average (at best) compilation of training techniques discovered and perfected by other (professional) dog trainers/behaviorists. I've read many, many books on dog training and behavior and this is one not worth purchasing. If you're looking for an interesting read to learn more about how dogs think and why they act the way they do - check out any of Stanley Coren's books (he has many). If you're looking for training techniques - take a class. Honestly, there is nothing better for a dog than to go to puppy classes (with a respectable and knowledgable trainer) where they can be properly socialized and trained. If your dog is having serious behavior issues - consult a professional animal behaviorist. Your veterinarian should be able to refer you to somebody. Good luck! 
 Irving is one of my top favorite authors...but I was SO disappointed in "Until I Find You." I could not relate to any of the characters. I thought they were all miserable and just plain pathetic. I held out until about page 600 until I gave up and put the book down. I didn't even care to know what happened to the main character, Jack, at the end.   Jack's mother is a tattoo artist. The book goes into heavy detail about tattooing, which I found totally unnecessary and frankly, a distraction from an already convoluted plot. In fact, three quarters of the way through the book I still couldn't figure out what exactly we were supposed to care about with this plot.   Was the whole point that that people are misguided, confused and damaged? Who knows. The characters were just so annoying and unlikeable that I found it to be a real chore to read this book.   Read ANY of Irving's other books before this one. 
 Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world 
 I bought this book along with the Zombie Survival guide based on the reader recommendations here as I wanted something a bit out of the ordinary to read. I'd have to say this is by far the worse of the 2.  Unlike the Zombie Survival Guide, which actually reads like a real factual book, this one is just lacking. I realise its a parody book, but there wasn't a huge amount of detail or humor involved. Maybe it's aimed at a younger age group or possibly someone with a minimal knowledge of super heroes and comics, I don't know, but as an adult who was an avid comic book reader in my younger years it failed to make the grade. It just didn't quite capture me, I read it on and off over a couple of weeks and don't feel the urge to read the last few chapters.  Maybe if it was sanctioned by Marvel or DC comics giving it more liscence to refer to more specific characters it would have been a better nostalgia peice, in its current form it reads like a weak joke stretched way too far 
 Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits. I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH 
 Fukuyama misunderstands history in a way that is not entirely his own.  One need only leaf through the pages of Hegel to find such unfounded optimism.   As a scholar, I recently took a look at what would be the continuation of Fukuyama's statistical work.  That is, the growth of democracy, and it's funny how that growth has been curbed in the past 10 years or so.  Time will show this book to be Fukuyama's Folly 
 I read voraciously, and bought this one expecting a story about thorobred horse racing. Instead, I got a lot of whining from an obviously very insecure author. Except for 6-7 pages about Secretariat that were good, the rest of the book is a waste. My reaction to this author was: grow up and get a life.  Tossed it into the garbage when I was done it was so bad I wouldn't even bother to pass it on to friends 
 I never read Madeline books as a child and was captivated by them when I started reading them to my child.  I was very excited to make this book a part of my holiday book collection. However I should have read this one before buying!This one makes no sense, its hardly about Christmas at all and the usual charming rhymes are not there. Check this one out at the library before buying 
 I bought this book for my Costa Rica trip (8 weeks w/ a class, 3 weeks w/o), and replaced it within the first week. Most of the hotels are priced above what is listed, if they even exist anymore. Same with the restaurants. Also, LP over-emphasized many extreme tourist hotspots without giving enough info about smaller towns (don't miss Cauhita!), lesser-known forests (check out the Children's Eternal Rainforest), getting around by bus, super-budget hotels or border crossings. My advice: wait until you get into Costa Rica, then get the Tico Times guidebook, updated EVERY YEAR, written by the local english newspaper. It's easy to find and so much more relevant, with maps of every town, bus schedules, local festivals (where and when), border information, updated hotel + restaurant info, and how to find the information you can't find anywhere else.  
 I have read many individual conversion stories to Judaism. The majority are remarkable and beautiful as they highlight the personal transformation of an individual's path to conversion. That said, I found this book to be very tedious. The textual analysis did not flow well and it did not keep my attention 
 This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon.  Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks.  Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype.  Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier. 
 This production is okay--not a complete waste of time, but not great either. Overall, the script is a very shallow translation of the book, particularly regarding Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.   Though Ewan McGregor is pretty forgettable as Frank Churchill (partly because of the script), and Toni Collette seems to be less Harriet Smith and more Forrest Gump at some points, there are still some excellent performances.  Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly).  I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates.  Overall, this production looks pretty, but it's Austen for the masses.  People who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and aren't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it.  For the rest of us, I recommend the production of Emma staring Kate Beckinsdale. 
 The author of this book has accomplished nothing more than gathering a lot of GM service manuals photo copying the pages as they relate to all years of Chevelle and bound them up into a book. Where are the facory colors for  various body componets and a good aftermarket match? For that matter how  about some color photos in the book? Forget the book and go to the many on  line Chevelle clubs for useful information. web pages and get the  information 
 I have trouble believing this is for small children. I tried to play this at a party with some friends. All of us who tried to play are in our 20s and 30s, and we couldn't figure out how the game was supposed to work. The DVD never makes it clear whose turn it is or what's really happening, and there are too many things added to the game from the original.  I've played the regular, classic version of Clue many times and enjoy it, but this new version is frustrating, complicated, and not fun at all. I can't imagine that children would actually have fun with this when four adults couldn't even figure out what was going on 
 What would you think of a foreign correspondent in America who wrote about the politics of the 1990s without exploring the influence of Christianity? New York Times correspondent Stephen Kinzer has written about Turkey in the `90s without any effort to take account of Islam.  America is a secular state with a Christian society. Turkey is a secular state with a Muslim society. If the object of your sermon -- "Crescent and Star" is a sermon not an analysis -- is to promote democracy, then Christianity is not too much of a problem. There are Christian democracies. But there are not any Muslim democracies, and it must be asked, is that a consequence or an accident?  Kinzer doesn't ask. He spends chapter after chapter on the Kurds, victims of a genocide in the `90s that most of the world chose not to see. Some pages on women, a few on economics. Several chapters on the army, which runs the country as a disguised military dictatorship. Page after page about the ineffectual political system and corrupt parties.  Kinzer is capable of breathtakingly stupid writing. My favorite example is his description of the father of the republic, Kemal Ataturk: "Ataturk and his comrades came to think of themselves as righteous crusaders." I doubt any Turk ever thought of himself as any kind of crusader.  Without providing the slightest evidence, Kinzer opines: "Many devout Muslims . . . want to cooperate with secularists in building an open, tolerant nation." But the only political act tied to Islam in the book describes how Turkish Hezballah (Party of Allah) subjected Konca Kuris, a Muslim woman "who had written many articles describing Islam as a gentle, tolerant faith that demanded equality for women" to "unspeakable tortures," which they videotaped for the enjoyment and political/religious edification of Turkish Muslims.  "Crescent and Star" was finished shortly before Sept. 11, 2001, but even then anyone with eyes could see that tolerant Islam was losing ground. Even then, the secular, corrupt political establishment had made a bargain with expansionist Muslims (the Welfare Party) to bring them into the government. Readers of historical experience are likely to be reminded of how the conservatives in Germany thought they could tame Hitlerism by bringing it into the government.  Turkey would be another Iran now if the secular army had not stepped in to force the Welfarist prime minister Erbakan out. Kinzer gets half of it, writing  that "the worst legacy of Erbakan's disastrous year in power was that it convinced the army that Turks were still not ready for democracy."    But having just stated that Turks were unable to handle democracy, Kinzer also says Turks are "a people who are quite mature enough to deal with the challenge of freedom."  Kinzer adores Turkey and Turkishness. It is not clear whether he is blinded by love or just a silly twit.  
 This band was a great rock band once.  They say Hysteria superrocketed them to stardom, but I say it was the momentum from the truly good rock albums of Pyromania, High & Dry, and On Through The Night.  This band made intelligent rock with songs like Die Hard the Hunter, Billy's Got a Gun, Bringing on the Heartbreak.  They went totally into cheese with Hysteria, became hugely commercially successful, and abandoned the rock.  They need to go back to their roots and put something out for the rockers, not the teeny-boppers that love cheese 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 This book is NOT helpful.  It is poorly organized, full of typos, and not useful.  I am returning it. It's basically just a list of public campgrounds, with no information about location or real reviews, just a list of the amenities or facilities nearby. Stick to the interne 
 I really enjoyed Kelly Wearstler's Modern Glamour, but found this book to be disappointing.  There's no text, only seemingly self-serving photographs of her and her gowns in her over-designed house.  The only thought I had while flipping through the pages was how difficult it must be to keep it dusted!  I would have been much more satisfied were there some explanations as to how she might have come to some of her design conclusions, because to me it all seems cluttered and complicated, and somewhat random.  I guess that's part of the appeal, but I expected more text and fewer images of the woman herself.  One quick flip through this one is enough - borrow it from the library 
 Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D 
 I was disappointed in the author's overuse of the word intuition.  Especially since he did not define it in the book, and then he attached it to many other words and really overused it, ending up in the last chapter with 66 uses.  I enjoyed the substantive content, but feel he deconstructed too much.  His use of counterintuitive was also bothersome. I could not get beyond my own conception that intuition is something that feels an inspiratation from outside oneself, and therefore his use grated on me from the get go.  Many folks today are using the term intuition in a contemporary sexy way, colloquially, and what they really mean to say deals more with guessing and rational thought processed, than the frequently surprising and unexpected aspects of true, often irrational, intuition 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read. 
 Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one 
 I bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch.  The v-notched end was too thick to fit - I used my pocket knife instead.  Maybe there's a "knack" to it, but I didn't want to scratch my watch while practicing. The pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small, recessed auto-set buttons for which a ball-point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy. But you probably have something around the house that would work just as well (mini-screwdriver, the point of a phillips head... 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I have read all these guys books and have read, with rapt curiosity, their opinion of me and my generation, the Millennials, who began graduating high school in 2000.  I am most at odds with their opinion of Millennials and church. They claim that we will be more churched than our parents.  At least in Utah, this trend is not happening. What is happening is this:  according to something I read released by the Mormon church, for every Mormon couple that currently has four children, only two will stay active Mormons.  A youth pastor in the area where I live has had a similar experience.  Half of the youth that graduate from the church youth group don't join the singles group, and half of those that did join the singles group fall out two years later.  Several college ministers and many Mormon bishops have complained about a similar problem with college ministries near at least one Utah college.  No one goes to the college groups.  The retention rate is 50% or worse.  Hardly the generation that will be going to church in droves.  Plus, how do you explain the problem of prescription drug abuse?  Cheating?  While we may not be as deviant as Gen X, we are hardly the little saintly prudes these two have made us out to be.  The church retention rate just doesn't fly with me.  I am not seeing, here or in Iowa, the insane church attendance that these guys predict.  Many of us, like I said, drop out once we turn 18.  Many of the people I know are just like me: we do have religious beliefs, but we get nothing out of church and so we don't go.  Take this book with a grain of salt-it is somewhat on the mark, but not entirely on the mark.  For those who claim that this book has not been given a chance, it has been six years since they penned it and very little of what is in here has happened.  Secondly, according to How and Strauss, there are, at best, roughly 14 more graduating classes of Millennials.  And then it is on to the next generation.  To date I have seen less than half this stuff come true.  
 This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say 
 I was convinced to sample the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever upon reading the reviews on Amazon.  Many debated the merit of the trilogy due to the tragic and conflicted soul of the protagonist, Covenant himself.  He was described as an anti-hero.  Having read books one and two of these Chronicles, it was not Covenant who alienated me, but instead the writing of Stephen Donaldson.  I enjoyed the first book in a qualified way.  It was not a quick and exciting read, but I felt it had its merit.  One could feel for the plight of Thomas Covenant (being a leper and learning to survive as a leper only to be thrust into a world where his leprosy appeared healed - sure it would be great if it were true but it is quite natural someone in his position would be reluctant to accept it).  The world was complex but well-developed.  The flaws (as I judge them) that I will point out shortly about The Illearth War (Book 2) were present in Lord Foul's Bane (Book 1) but they were more forgivable for some reason.  Anyway, there was merit enough in the first book to make me plod through the second.  I mention that it is Stephen Donaldson's writing that drives me away.  It does so in several ways.  First, his is a very dense writing style.  He uses words that the common person does not.  I am not suggesting he is putting on airs or trying to be high-minded, I assume he is just that way.  I believe the words flow naturally from him.  It must be a weird experience to have a conversation with the man!  Allow me to share a very simple example from The Illearth War: "Their nostrils distended at the vapory breath of dawn or dusk.  Their eyes roamed searchingly over the sunward crags, the valleys occasionally bedizened with azure tarns, the hoary glaciers crouching in the highest cols, the snow-fed streams... Their wide foreheads and flat cheeks and confident poise betrayed no heart upsurge, no visceral excitement.  Yet there was something clear and passionate in their alacrity..." (page 421).  You could find innumerable examples of such lofty prose throughout.  I am sure it is just the way he writes.  I just do not find it enjoyable.  It is so dense and dry.  There is no poetry to it even when the passages are descriptive.  It is like a highly technical and labored experience.  The words are so precise the life is sucked from the narrative.  Again, at least that is my humble opinion.  I do not mind slow or difficult reads when there is a payoff.  This one maximized the difficulty but minimized the payoff.  Second, he has created a world with its own terms.  I suppose this is realistic in its way (although everyone speaks English most of the time anyway).  He gives us a brief glossary, but I would prefer my reads to do without one.  I have no idea what he is talking about when he uses the fictitious expressions.  It may make an exciting adventure for some readers but it just turned me off.  Who wants to work that hard to learn about a place that doesn't exist?  At least the fantasy words could have had some common root with our language.  Then things could have been somewhat intuitive.  Instead it was just gibberish to me.  And it played such a vital part throughout his works.  To not appreciate this literary device makes his work hard to enjoy.  Third, he builds ever so slowly to a climax.  Then the climax occurs and is gone and you feel like you must have missed something.  "Oh, so that's it," I was left thinking.  It was a long journey (a painful one at times, certainly a slow one), and then the payoff is not very rewarding.  Fourth, the bad guys seem awfully powerful.  I couldn't help wondering why they just didn't sweep all the good guys away.  They seem as though there is nothing that can stop them.  But then the good "lords" display similar power.  The magical powers just seem too present and too readily available for us common folk to relate to the struggle.  I couldn't find a reality to the war that was raging.  I didn't understand most of the magical beings.  They were not developed very fully.  I certainly credit Donaldson for his imagination.  He brings depth to the characters.  He seems to have created a world with a great degree of internal consistency.  I commend him for his talent, but if you are like me you won't much appreciate it.  These books remind me of Gene Wolfe and his works that compose The Book of the New Sun.  That work was more science fiction, but the protagonist also had darker issues to be dealt with.  Both worlds were difficult for me to identify with.  Both used expressions that made no sense to me.  They were both slow and deep reads.  If you like this Covenant series, I whole-heartedly recommend Wolfe's series to you (and vice versa).  My life would be no worse off had I missed both experiences.  I am going to skip The Power that Preserves (book 3) and just hope it all works out. 
 I was anxious to read the books written by this author since they take place near Charleston, a place we visit often.  I was very disappointed!  This book should have ended about 3 chapters earlier.  The book lacked depth and character development.  The dialogue was contrite and superficial.  I will definitely NOT be reading anymore books from this author 
 Like many fitness gurus who resort to training as an escape from learning science, math, and the other related disciplines, yet believe that they could master the complexity of these integrated fields, without even touching a text book, Bob Greene embodies such naïve and simplistic approach.  In this book, he improvises many flawed information, believing that the folks training for fitness are the last people to discover his lazy and flawed interpretation of the physiology of fitness.  Although he states that this book is not about fitness or diet, yet he deals solely with fitness and diet claiming to enhance health and emotional well being. He describes FOUR phases for accomplishing that goal as follows:  (1)	Phase One is preparation in which he recommends drinking a minimum of 6 glasses of water daily.  (2)	Phase Two is revving up your metabolism in which he recommends drinking a minimum of 7 glasses of water daily.  (3)	Phase Three deals with emotional eating in which he recommends drinking a minimum of 8 glasses of water daily.  (4)	Phase Four deals with emotional well being in which he recommends drinking 9 glasses of water daily.   So, if the 6, 7, 8, and 9 numbers do not raise your suspicion about the irrationality of this author, hold your breath, for you will have to unlearn all common knowledge and relearn new flawed information from this book, as follows:   (1) On page 59, the author states:  "Physically fit individuals store considerably more water than unfit individuals. This explains how a very fit person can weigh much more than their appearance would suggest".     He does not cite a reference for such simplistic explanation. One would assume that a physically fit person has better cardiovascular condition that manages water storage more efficiently without accumulating body fluids. He explains that based on the glycogen contents of fit muscles, while ignoring the increased calcium storage in fit people that adds to their bodyweight.   In that page also, he states: "daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal water cycles fluctuation is not fully understood" without citing any reference for such bizarre phenomena that he alone believes in.   (2) On page 66, he defines "metabolism" as the rate that your body burns calories and that `rate' is the key word. He thus does not understand that metabolism is a process of assimilating biological products.    (3) On page 67, he erroneously states: "There is no way to measure the rate of burning calories directly other than feeling perspiration and getting clothes more loose after exercise."  He thus does not understand the basic physiological experiment of measuring caloric expenditure that many high school kids learn in high school.   He erroneously states that "when you're dehydrated, you eat more" and calls that "artificial hunger". That is very bizarre way of interpreting physiology.  (4) On page 107, he claims that research proves that 30 to 40 minutes per week of aerobics is adequate, without citing any source for that research.   (5) On page 109, he erroneously claims that low intensity exercise burns lots of calories but makes you get "very hungry" and eventually eat back all of the burned-off calories.  There is no justification for that false claim.  (6) On page 117, he states that alcohol contains 7 calories per gram without stating which type of alcohol. The USDA National Nutrient Database gives less than 3.83 Calories/ gram of WHISKEY, other alcoholic beverages contain less than that.  (7) On page 152, he claims that starting training with weights in phase One will increase your appetite, which is another bizarre discovery.  (8) The book has 72 blank sheets, for the reader to fill in, out of 200 pages of the whole books. There are no references.  
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 not a bad case, but not worth the money.  your pocket works just as well 
 this movie is such a rip-off of every sci-fi/horror movies that have come before it that i just couldn't enjoy it! a waste of my time and money and i'll not waste any more time on this stinker or it's review!! 
 I used an earlier version of this book as an undergrad.  I am happy with the experience and the knowledge I gained of the theoretical underpinnings of electronics.  On the other hand, it never really helped me take the next step in using or applying the information.  I kept the book as it was one I felt would help me long term and I liked it, but once working in electonics, I find it really wasn't useful.  Most of the problems I see on a day to day basis were never addressed and the methods I learned in graduate level classes were much more powerful.   I do wish more students had the underlying knowledge of electonics, so many engineers these days don't know why or how semiconductors work!   The way I saw the book is that it teaches one how to drive a car by exlaining the gas pedal, the engine, the transmission, the tires, and the road.   Great to know, but it never gets around to clearly saying why something is the way it is or clearly summarizing the important points.  
 I thought "Priciples of Meat Science" was just okay. But I think  "The Sopranos" is much, much better. Hopefully, this is not the  best that the Lifetime Channel can do. I wish they'd show the reruns of  "Homicide, Life on the Street" again, because I can't watch  "Court TV" (it's against my parole. 
 if you know nothing about vb it might be useful; treats you like an idio 
 Ok, I have every Korn album.  I love them all but after Untouchables, they have gone downhill.  Their music sucks.  They think their metal but all they do is just scream and bitch.  Johnathan can't even scream so why try?  It just sucks.  Sure there are about 2-3 good songs on here but thats all.  This album and SYOTOS suck really bad.  Listen to the old Korn, thats much better 
 I read this (after reading Karen Hancock's Christy Award-winning series Legends of the Guardian-King) and enjoyed it at first. After reading the second book, DragonQuest, I realized that these books were influencing me wrongly. The wizardry is cloaked in Christianity, so it makes it seem ok at first. But once I'd read the second book, I saw that where it was going was somewhere I didn't want to go.  I would recommend many other books before recommending this book 
 The Pale Blue Eye by Louis Bayard is, like the writings of one of his characters, a tale of mystery and imagination.  Set at West Point in the 19th Century, the novel has all the flavor and ambiance befitting such a setting.  I love reading books that fictionalize real people.  Bayard fictionalizes the leadership of West Point at that time, as well as one of the most eccentric writers in American history.    The chief investigator of this mystery/detective novel enlists one Cadet Edgar Allen Poe to assist him in his investigation.  Bayard brings Poe to life to a greater extent than he does with any of his other characters.  Reading the chapters of Poe's reports to Gus Landor, the chief investigator of this creepy, mysterious case, I couldn't help but think that Bayard was having a lot of fun at Poe's expense.  Bayard does an excellent job of writing Poe's reports to Landor in a tongue-in-cheek faux-Poe.   Even though the story line has every creepy element conceivable, mysterious murders, hearts stolen from corpses, villains stealing through the darkness in cloaks, mysterious strangers, disappearing cadets and a graveyard of other things, whenever Poe walked off the page, it all turned dull. Bayard tried to make his protagonist interesting.  Gus Landor, an ex-New York detective with a mysterious past (I'm getting tired of using the word mysterious) and a bend toward alcoholism leads the investigation.    Throughout the book, Landor looked up at me from the page, wanting me to care about him.  I just couldn't.  He wasn't likeable or interesting.    The Pale Blue Eye feels like a guy book. If we have Chick-Lit, here is an example of Dick-Lit.  Distinctive brown cover, technical tools on the cover, and mahogany tones and pipe smoke throughout.  All of the women characters are difficult to bring into focus.  They're silly little things, panting for attention and totally oblivious about how trivial they are.  Even the one with the biggest part to play didn't place a shred of passion on the side of sanity.  Landor has a cookie-cutter girl friend, a barmaid who is sleeping with scores of others.  She is there so that we can have bosoms swaying to the rhythm of pot scrubbing and because we need someone who looks at him with distain and tells him to quit the case because it's killing him.      And then there's the end.  Don't worry.  I won't give it away.  But I will tell you that there's a twist.  And it's not foreshadowed to an extent where it is warranted. In other words, Bayard broke the cardinal rule of novel writing.  I felt manipulated.  The twist comes from so far out of the court that I was beginning to wonder if I'd get through the book without having aliens land and tell us they were just there to serve man.    But then there's Poe.  He plays his part unflinchingly.  The Pale Blue Eye is fun for anyone who wants to be prompted to read a biography about Poe.  I know I want to get one.  The details Bayard supplies about him are crisp, humorous and fascinating.  Was he ever a cadet at West Point? Did he dedicate his first book of poems to the Academy because he'd manipulated the cadets into buying a copy?  Considering all that the book has given me to think about, I guess I'm glad I read it.  But I'm even more glad that it's over 
 This 84 page book is evenly divided between intstructions on how to build a brick oven and recipes for baking in it.  I have not tried the recipes. I made an impulsive purchase of this book because I have been interested in building a brick oven for some time.  I mistakenly thought that I would gain some insights and practical tips that were missing from The Bread Builders by Daniel Wing and Alan Scott.  I did not. There is, in my opinion too little detail in this book to actually construct a quality oven.  
 i wonder if those people at SOny took a moment to watch the final product, before they put it out in the market! i am sure they didn't. the audio is one of the worst that i have ever experienced and what happened to subtitles, i guess it would cost a buck or two for the improve the quality for us funs. Heads up and BRAVO TO COLUMBIA producing the first two seasons. Sony watch out 'cause you are bringing cheap ... in the market and costumers are getting tired of it! wish i had kept my money and spend it something else!!! 
 Hi, I have never written any reviews and don't plan on making a habit of it, but I know what it is to be truly heartbroken. I want to help you in any way I can because I know what you are going through. I have read every book on the subject that is out there, believe me. If you are really hurting, this book is not for you. It does not give you practical advice to help you get through the hurt. It's goal is to make you laugh and even at that, when you are hurting so badly, that is hard to do. I recommend two books for you: "You Didn't Complete Me" and "It's Called a Break-up because it's Broken." These were much more helpful to me. 
 I admire Leavitt but agree with the reviewers who say this is not his best work.  I have read all of his fiction and especially liked the earliest works--Family Dancing and Lost Language of Cranes. This novel, however, despite the easy flow of the writing, did not stir my interest. The characters weren't fully realized--and I could not conjure feelings for any of them.  The plot was quick paced, but to what end?  So much time was covered so quickly that I had trouble staying fully engaged. Also, credulity was often stretched to the breaking point--I never before sensed this as a problen in Leavitt's writing. I was ready to jettison at midpoint, mystery or no, but finished nevertheless. 
 I give this book 2 stars because several sources were listed that I found interesting, mainly because I'm a Stevie Nicks collector and love to look for magazine articles on her at eBay.  This book names several magazine articles featuring Stevie.  Unfortunately, this is the only place the author gets his info.  His closest Stevie connection is a woman who would run occasional errends for Stevie.  The book reads like a first grade book report on someone famous.  The author seems like a huge Stevie fan, but not a real journalist.  The pictures are worth more than the words, but it's not marketed as a "Stevie Photo Book"... 
 First I want to say that I am probably the biggest Ann Rule fan, I have read every non-fiction book she has ever written...but I was shocked that she would even attempt a fictional book!  I feel there is so much REAL  CRIME out there,  why would anyone want to make up something like this up?   This was a big disappointment 
 Dillard's work is poetic, but her conclusions troubling.  She tries to form a redemptive narrative of material that cannot be answered by this simplistic approach.  For example, she addresses a young girl who has been  badly burned, telling the girl that she has become a nun in her suffering,  that she will learn something, that it won't take this young girl as long  to come to the same realizations that she, Dillard herself, has reached.   This seems a hubris of the most disturbing kind, to use the suffering of  another to say "now you'll know what I've known," when it's  entirely questionable whether or not Dillard can claim this kind of  suffering.  Or, even if she can, that she attempts to instruct another in  the realm of what lies beyond instruction.  Dillard's thoughts are worth  reading, but they also require a careful questioning, as her assumptions  are sometimes highly problematic 
 These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD 
 This album contains a lot of experimental music, with a few early Talking Heads type songs sprinkled in.  If you like Brian Eno's experimental music, you will like this album 
 This text is by far the worst college text I have encountered in my educational career.  Where most texts stick to relevant facts and figures relating to their area of study, this text delves into opinion coupled with unbridled conjecture.  The text is littered with political opinions and political assumptions made about its reader, while listing irrelevant facts and theories that support a socialist Democrat view of the society of the United States.  Karl Marx and Socialism are continually defended as just economic forms of society while Capitalism is openly bashed at every page turn.  Conspiracy theories thrive in this book as it even accuses the United States' representational democracy as being ineffective, and that the country is actually ran by a conspiratorial "power elite."  The author often inserts personal opinion and biased so-called "personal experiences" with social issues as facts, and assumes the reader is a freshmen student unable to discern his fact from his fiction.   Here is a short excerpt from page 189, contained within a chapter dealing with social class:  Like many people, you may have said to yourself, "Sure I can vote, but somehow the big decisions are always made despite what I may think.  Certainly, I don't make the decision to send soldiers to Afghanistan or Iraq.  I don't launch missiles against Kosovo, or Baghdad.  I don't decide to raise taxes or interest rates.  It isn't I who decides to change welfare benefits."  I think it is clear here and in other excerpts from the text that the author should be writing editorials for his local newspaper instead of college texts.  It seems to me that the author intends to mold the minds of the college youth in his political image under the guise of giving a factual accounting of the field of Sociology.  I absolutely do not recommend this book to anyone, and think it is time to inform my university of the contents of this text before more students are forced to purchase it in its next incarnation.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.  If you feel the same as I do about this text, then please speak up at your local university and here.  
 Donald Fegan was an extremely talented musician.  I absolutely loved both of his older solo albums, as well as all of his work under the name "Steely Dan".  The way his music flowed was unbeleivable.  Morph the cat does not sound anything like any of his previous work.  Every time you think that you get the flow of the song, he throws you a curve ball.  You cannot enjoy this music simply by hearing it, and if you listen to it you get bored by repeating lyrics.  Some of the songs were okay, such as "Mary shut the garden door", "What I do", and especially "Morph the cat", but do not expect to hear the old Dan.  I do intend on listening to the album through several (more) times, in order to give it more of a fair chance (although "IGY" and "Trans Island Skyway" sucked me in so that I couldn's have turned it off if I tried.)  If I decide that I like the album, I will post another review, but I don't think that that is likely to occur.  If you are a fan as I am, I strongly suggest that you don't buy this album, not to save the money, but to save the memory 
 This book is mediocre at best for professionals who know nothing about the business--there are much better ones out there. While the information in this book seems accurate, it was very shabbily put together. Don't waste  your money on this one 
      Forever in Blue is about four friends who are in college and go to four different places for the summer, and this summer Bee went to Turkey, Tibby went to New York, Carmen went to drama school, and Lena stayed home.  They all went through tough time and they all went through happy times.  The one thing that kept them together are these pair of jeans that they mailed to each other through out the summer.      My favorite part of the book was when Carmen went to drama school with her friend Julia.  When Carmen went to this school she was very unhappy and thought Julia was the greatest friend.  She later on in the story met this lady named Judy who forced her to audition for the play when she didn't want to.  While all this was happening she realized that Julia wasn't the bestest of friends, and she found herself again.      Out of all the books I have read I wouldn't say this was my favorite and I actually didn't really like it.  This book wasn't as impressive as the rest of the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  The reason I didn't like it was because some of the parts weren't that right, but that's my opinion.  In conclusion I don't think this book is the greatest, but I think you should find out for yourself. 
 It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily. The shipping was fast and the price was right 
 . . . of about 50 minutes i'll never get back.  the movie is 93 minutes, but around minute 53 I decided I was so bored and didn't care what happened.  Like another review, I agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive.  not quirky or interesting.  they're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that.  and did i mention it was boring?  so mind numbingly boring.  there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what I assume this movie was attempting.  i can't be bothered to think of examples, because i'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this 
 I disagree with the previous reviewers on all points but one.  Meander hardly does justice.  Schneider's prose is enough to put anyone to sleep.  As for long summer afternoons on the front porch,  if the object is to take  a nap, skip this book and get right to the nap.  The point I agree with the  others on?  check out Bullough's Pond, it's a much better read 
 I bought this book after reading that it was supposed to be a good source of simple easy to prepare meals.... NOT! The ingredients are tough to find and the fancy recipes aren't at all close to "everyday cooking".  You'll have more chest pain trying this book than a whole case of deep-fried cheesesticks could ever cause 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 I've read other books about American Indians and have seen how it can be done well.  This is the worst book on any group of American Indians that I have ever seen.  The auther starts out with 100 or more pages of anthropological speculation that he unqualified and unfit to enter into.  If you make it through this first grueling hundred pages or so you find a book that is hamstrung by the authors bias.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 I could not wait to get this- I love most of their books. But it had few recipes, and what was there was nothing I did not have in many other books.   The book says on the cover it is about traditional cooking of New Mexico. Then has recipes like fajitas, which they even say came from Texas fairly recently. What is there is fine, but I suppose I expected more traditional native american dishes that had influenced New Mexico, not what I would consider to be typical Tex-Mex. 
 Call me whatever you will, but I did NOT "get" this book.  jg 
 What a bunch of tripe!    I was prepared to read a book about the secret life of sororities only to find urban legend after urban legend printed as if it were true.  I was very disappointed.  I guess the key here is that anyone can take a bunch of urban legends, claim they followed 4 fictional people through it, and claim it was real.  Heck, maybe I should write a book.  Anyone want to hear about my four friends who picked up an exploding cactus and chihuahua while in Mexico?  It's true... really! They told me all about it 
 When the character who is narrating a lengthy novel is as unbelievable and artificial as Hannah Musgrave is in "The Darling", the book is not worthy of completing.    
 There is no point in buying this book if you have read Make the Connection.  Calling this a new book borders on fraud 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 This book is bossy, opinionated and completely unrealistic for any woman who has kids, or works, let alone both.  Sure, there are some good hints and tips; but the last thing that frantic women need is yet more things to add on their to-do lists, and to be made to feel bad if they don't plan their Christmas gift-buying in July or flip their mattress 4 times a year.  Don't buy this book - the useful tips are overshadowed by the theme running throughout that you're failing as a wife and mother if you don't check off their endless tasks.  Happy, well-adjusted households do not need to have pristine closets.. 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 While the subject matter was good, the writing style was lacking.  Plus, I don't think she applies the same level of high-mindedness to herself as she does to other people.  She seems to like to cut down trees but then complains later about flooding from upgradient homeowners that have cut down their trees.  Also, she drowns possums.  She complains that she raises her food to live on and she can't spare any to varmints.  I'm not sure what she thinks the possum was eating the food for.  I suspect to live on.  And some of her arguments don't hold water.  Like the vegetarian argument mentioned earlier.  THis book could have used better editing.  
 I grew up listening to Bob Dylan, and was really looking foward to his his new DVD, Modern Times, and was really disgusted when i tried the bonus DVD in two dvd players i have,and lent it to a friend to try,and neither one of us could get it to play.I should have returned it,but after my friend tried and failed to get it to play,as stated,i was just disgusted. I desided not to order any more music DVDs from Amazon.I must say that the  music on the first DVD was great,starting with Thunder On The Mountain,it was good to listen to some new Dylan. 
 I found the book informative while reading it, but also a bit confusing and a little dry, best used for a college course and not for recreational reading.  (Which is no doubt why we even had it in our house, someone had  to use it and it's equally boring companion for some college course, I'm  certain of it... 
 Two cents from a rank amateur/beginning programmer. At the moment, I'm on page 179 of this book and the main problem I have so far is with the way the information is communicated. Personally, I now know that I should have picked up a book that taught VB concepts via small projects and tasks. A "in chapter 1 we'll build a simple tool to get familiar w/ the IDE. In chapter 2 we'll improve our skillset by building a slightly advanced tool to learn about declaring variables, etc." approach would work better for me. Unfortunately, this book doesn't  really do that. The concepts here are explained mostly with bits of standalone code. Hopefully, perhaps by page 200, we'll commence with some "learning by doing." Yes, hopefully. In the meantime, I'll grit my teeth and continue with the book, but right now it simply isn't working for me 
 It's been about 7 or so years as far as I can remember since I last saw South Park, and I have to say, I just remember it being more funny.  This movie was unbearably lame.  On the tv shows, there are actually some witty lines.  I just sat through this movie listening to stupid songs that weren't even funny, just the "shock value" of watching cartoons curse.  The curses weren't even funny, either ... just sort of stupid 'baby talk' type profanity; what is an "Uncle F&%*er" anyways?  I have to conclude that Stone and Parker are two of the most overrated guys out there.  Team America World Police just sort of drifted around with again, the novelty of puppets cursing.  And while I rented this film hoping to just have some stupid fun like I did years ago watching South Park on tv, it was a real disappointment.  Who cares about the cursing?  That's not what put me off.  It was just not funny 
 There are many reviews of this book that are on target.  I will keep mine short.  The author of the book is hostile to Christianity and hides behind supposed scholarship.  The book is largely biased opinions.  If one strains, one can find some useful information.  For anyone who wants to see the author's bias most clearly, get a copy of the book and look at the last page of the last chapter.  There, the author puts forth such an absurd anti-Christian, anti-Bible, and anti-American vision that the rest of the book is put clearly into the context from which the author writes.  I read the whole book, looking for a few nuggets, but finding few.  My recommendation is that this book is not worth reading and certainly not worth buying 
 As an avid listener of the mad dog's radio program, I really wanted to read his book.  After all, he plugged it at every possible moment on air for three months.  It must be good, right?  Not really.  This book is not for the hard core sports fan.  At the same time, I can't imagine a casual sports fan picking it up either.  At every turn of the page there was one big problem - no depth.  There was no subject that grabbed a hold of me and consequently, I found the book boring.    Too much SF Giants and NY Yankees.  He had no thoughts that made me even remotely  interested.  How would mad dog change the NHL?  Everyone knows the dog doesn't even watch the NHL!  Not even in the playoffs.  Get rid of the blue line!  Why didn't I think of that?  I was really looking for the fire that makes his radio show special.  Maybe all of those years being bored having to listen to Mike have finally taken their toll.  About the only chapter I found interesting was the one where he recommends his favorite sports books.  I plan on reading the ones on his list that I missed.   I doubt this book will make anyone's list.  Sorry Doggie 
 I thought this book was very well researched, however, I was disappointed to see that 30 pages are notes and bibliography in a book that is 310 pages in length.  This book could also use another good edit for several 'snags' that I encountered.  Otherwise it is a good read 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
 Hagiographies were, historically, written for the edification of the faithful.  That describes this disappointing work rather well:  for those who wish to hear only the positive, and the classic story of repentance and redemption, the basic story is competently told, and it will, perhaps, serve its purpose.  But it offers little or nothing to the thinking Christian (or non-) reader:  there is little or no critical evaluation of Colson and his story and (disappointing to this reader) little too on the remarkable movement that he has been so involved in creating and leading, Prison Fellowship.  Colson's is an inspiring story, but little or no purpose is served by setting him up as a plaster saint.  There is a fascinating tale to be told, and real Christians still struggle today with the moral ambiguities and compromises of life in the world's centres of power.  Sadly, this book is not the one for them 
 I do love the Rogues, but I would never have selected a guy like Leander - he was too timid, too, I don't know, flat.  Judith wasn't much better.  Even when they first met, there was little to recommend them as a couple 
 The Jerky seemed to be old and hard and was too tough to chew. It also was a little Bland for me. I did like the peppered Jerky much better 
 I needed a book to give an efficient overview of SQL as used with the JDBC.  This book has not suited my needs.  In the "Why I Wrote This Book" section of the Introduction, the author says "There are many good books on SQL, but almost all focus on interactive SQL..."  As far as I know, SQL is SQL whether it is used interactively (queries entered directly by end-user) or from application code.  Also, this book contains way too much Microsoft Access and Microsoft SQL Server specific SQL, not the makings for a database-independent Java application 
 This book is accurate as a blind folded archer spun 3 times in a game of pinata. There is no real useful info in this book, you'd get more tactics out of a Steven Seagal film. This book should be taken out of print before some dummy hurts themselves. If you're interested in learning the tricks of the trade buy a surplus field manual (FM), Watch Discovery Channel, or Join the Military or some Government agency. Billy Powell was a very misinformed hippie. The part that gave it all away was the part about the M-1 Garand. "Used in both World Wars and Korea" WW2 and Korea yes, WW1 no. I think its luck of some higher power that this dummy didn't hurt himself in the process. 
 I found How to Start a Magazine by James Kobak difficult to read and somewhat depressing.  The promises on the cover, in my humble opinion, we never fulfilled and the textbook-style format was flat.  I felt as if, rather than a telling me "how to" he was telling me all the reasons "not to."  He also came from only one perspective--that of a large scale, national publication.  My goal is to build a local business-builder magazine.  Therefore, much of the information was irrelevant for me.  Based on the cover promises, I thought I'd found the ideal book for my needs.  It didn't deliver.  
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 I got these knives as a gift. Ironically, the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped "Stainless Steel".   Let's be realistic. These knives are cheap. They're thin and they're not well weighted. However, they say stainless steel, and you figure that that's what you're getting. I hand-washed these knives and dried them immediately, but they still corroded.   Now comes the bad part. I wrote to their customer service department twice and didn't hear back. I finally got their address (from the post office) and sent them back the knives. It took three months of me emailing and calling them (with 15+ minute wait times for Each Call) to get them to send me a replacement set.   The replacement set rusted in about two weeks. That was in September. I just got off the phone with Miracle Blade, a call during which I was interrupted so many times that I actually had to say "I'm going to finish my sentence" so their rep would stop talking. They won't refund my money. In fact, they won't refund Anyone's money after 30 days. The lifetime warranty is for replacement only. They'll send me another set of soon-to-be-rusty knives, of course--if I pay the shipping and handling...Again. I asked the rep for his full name, for his ID#, and for a manager, and he refused all requests.   In summary, if you buy these knives, they will rust. You will want to get rid of them. Your only option will be the garbage can 
 The 2 stars is the average I give to all the fable books written by Patrick.   The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: 5 stars  Obviously, it is the best one. (you can see it from the sales record in Amazon). It was the first Patrick's book I read. I have finished reading the whole book in one setting and couldn't wait and jump to look for his other books. The book has a reasonable length, setting up a bit simplified, but not over-simplified, and still reasonable fable-like setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills. The whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read. Highly recommended!    Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable 4 stars  It is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions. A very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them. I recommend you buy one, read it and keep it as a reference. One drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he didn't take his pills. I never work with such an unusual person and I prefer less dramatic in a management fable. (not something like in "Desperate Housewife", the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her Chinese maid to bear her baby.)   I should have stopped here and never rush to read his other books..    The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: 2 stars  This is the one made me begin to feel betrayed. If the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within weeks. The fable setting needs more polishing works. Although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy, reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot. Scenarios like how the VP HR plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers, not mentioning for managers. The rough plot affects the whole four points--though four very good points. I will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore.    Five temptations of CEO 1 star?  It is the one makes me begin to feel angry. Again, if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within hours. The major story (95% of the book) happened in a dark train, where a poor CEO was taught about these five temptations by some ghost-like old men, who turned out later to be the previous CEOs in the SAME company! Again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points. It is the plot that made me sick. If you have a chance, skim the whole book in less than FIVE minutes.   Silos, Politics and Turf Wars NEGATIVE 1 star  The worst one. Negative 1 star is because it wasted my time. I thought the five temptation one was the worst until I read this one. Patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution. And he even spends many pages about the main character's struggle in balancing his work and his wife's pregnancy, which I believe, should belong to another fable about personal life balance, given how many pages the author devoted to this. From other fables, more or less, you can at least learn something. But not from this one. Forget it!  
 Paralysed Age is O.K but I've heard better. "Bloodsucker 2000" is my favorite track on this CD but it all sounds rather bland and seems to cater to the misfit "goth" teen scene. Save your money or better yet get The Vampire Lucan Wolf's CD "Vampire Nights" it's alot more fun and better produced 
 The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.  The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.  So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.    In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.  The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.  Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.  In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown "first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory."  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.  The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).  The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.  Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.  The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.  The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.  Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously 
 Wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the IOGEAR GIC251U 5-port USB card on a Dell Optiplex GX-1 running 98SE. (This computer already has 2 USB 1.1 ports.) The main problem is that the Add Hardware Wizard does not find a *.inf file in the IOGEAR-supplied CD folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the CD folder. User has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program. This results in installation of drivers that show up in the Device Manager. However, the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going.  Installed card seemed to work OK for a D-Link wireless adapter, but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-IOGEAR 1.1 ports. The following actions did not help. (1) swapping the card to another PCI slot, (2) downloading and installing more recent driver file from IOGEAR website, (3) three calls to customer support, where I found sympathy but so solution 
 The idea that modern life is administered and that we could only begin to be happy if the government provided us with food, clothing and shelter is foolish naivety. In his pampered life of academia his absurd ramblings missed the mark in enumerable ways. Marcuse has a total lack of historical or psychological perspective - he understands nothing about mankind. The middle ages was far more administered than the late twentieth century. We currently have access to any and all information but in the Middle Ages the only input for the average person was the from the church.  His idea that life would be much improved if men did not have to prove themselves in the marketplace is really intellectual absurdity to the Nth degree. While he sucked his living off the very people that had proved themselves in the market place - he wrote this trash. 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 While the book is not bad, the authors will give you the irritating feeling that they have milked this cow for all it is worth. Where does it end? Chicken Soup for the Soup Lover's Soul? Chicken Soup for the Mountain Climbers Soul? Chicken Soup for the Amazon Reviewer's Soul???  Where there is a buck to be made on inspiration, the authors of the "Chicken Soup" series will sniff it out 
 [Review of original score not of the period pieces]  Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and Band of Brothers contain some of the best, dramatic scoring for a war film.  Flags of our Fathers does NOT join that rank. There is no memorable music from Eastwood's too simplistic score.  It sounds nice on the trailer but on film, well, all you remember is the same melody played over and over then back and forth among the ensemble.  The weak trumpet piece is nice but gets trying after the two hours of film.  There's little score in the film and on the album hence the era filler music.    The score does support some parts of the film but it falls short during the flag rising.  That should have contained music that would make one's arm hair rise.  Didn't happen.  On album, the music is a tired listen.  Three stars for effort.  One star for boring original score.  Sorry, Eastwood.  Next time outsource your music to someone that specializes in that area of the filmmaking process 
 Unless you like ultra modern home designs, skip this book. The plans are impractical, especially with respect to kitchen layouts. Most of the homes have no vestibules in their entrances, which are a neccessity in colder climates 
 I found The Whole Woman more antagonistic and needlessly controversial than enlightening. Greer makes it quite clear that there is exactly one feminist left on the planet, and she is it.  I'm hard-pressed to think of any third-wave feminists who live up to her standards. To do so, you would have to be an earth-mother living in a separatist commune with her lesbian lover. There's nothing wrong with that lifestyle, but it's not one to which most feminists would aspire. It's not one to which I aspire.  Also, it's as limiting a construction of womanhood as the patriarchal one she deplores. What do you do if you are heterosexual? It's all very well for her to say that you can reconstruct yourself as a lesbian, but that's as insulting as the implication that homosexuals just need to try hard enough and they can be heterosexual.   In a similar vein, I found her views of men particularly unpleasant. She suggests in no uncertain terms that they're all potential adulterers, rapists, child-abusers, wife-beaters, misogynists, etc . . . etc . . ., and that any woman who wants an equal, non-exploitative relationship had better become a lesbian. It's hard to see it as anything but pure slander, backed up by the flimsiest of anecdotal evidence. Just because you can cite a few cases of sickos who get turned on by their baby daughters in their nightgowns does not mean that all fathers will inevitably turn to abuse.   The rest of the book is no better. It's very poorly researched and argued, and parts of it verge into the insane. She seems particularly taken with the idea of "primitive" women as whole women, because they aren't bound by Western concepts of femininity. What she doesn't mention is that those women experience the same oppression that Western feminists fought long and hard to overcome. They might not wear bras or high-heels, but that doesn't make them any less oppressed by patriarchy. It seems obvious to me that women from tribal societies do not generally have much real political power, but are doomed to bear lots of children and die young. When she does look at the appalling aspects of those societies, she puts a positive spin on them. There's even a section where she seems to defend female genital mutilation.   Also, I can imagine that some of her ill-informed views are extremely offensive to people in those situations. She describes IVF as patriarchal appropriation of and interference into the process of reproduction. Similarly, she suggests that women who don't opt for natural childbirth (without anaesthetic, of course) are allowing men to remove them from the process. It's utterly disrespectful of the choices women may choose to make, not because they've internalised their oppression but because inseminating themselves with a turkey-baster seems vaguely ludicrous or because they don't want to experience agonising pain.  It's been a while since I read a feminist book that made me angry and this one does so for all the wrong reasons. It makes me embarrassed to call myself a feminist. 
 The work of Duncan J. Watts was admittedly inspired by the work of social-psychologist at Harvard University, Stanley Milgram, in the late 1967 on experiment on the problem called "small world" problem: "anyone person in the world could be reached through a network of friends in only a few steps; in Watts language, "after the cocktail party banter in which two strangers discover that they have a mutual acquaintance and remind each other what "a small world" it is. Surprisingly, Milgram's results led to the phrase "six degrees of separation": the degree of network of friends between me and you will never be more than six! I know someone who knows someone who knows someone else who knows someone that knows someone who becomes my friend!  I feel a must to urge the readers to read the book in order to understand further what science of network can give us. Among the popular books of networks, reading Watts' Six Degrees is important since the book was made seriously by the author for unlimited readers. It is a time for physics gives something valuable on constructing new scientific sociological work to day.   Hokky Situngkir Bandung Fe Institut 
 Borrow the book from the library.  Wasting your money on fables is not wise (unless you like wasting money).  While entertaining, this is not worthy of a library collection item 
 I was in an airport looking for something to read. The selection was thin. Basically there was the NYT best seller rack and Dr. Phil. I generally like political thrillers and Brad Thor's Blowback seemed promising. I never read Thor, or even really know much if anything about him and his work. The book is "ripped from the headlines" which is another way of saying if it's paperback, the plot points are probably dated.   The book was enough to keep my attention from the in-flight Jennifer Anniston movie. After the trip, I found it hard to find the motivation to pick it up and finish it. The hard-boiled military hero is nothing new nor real original. The main antagonist is a cut-throat Democrat Senator "who will stop at nothing" to take down the President. The character is named Helen Remington Carmichael, and the initials aren't the only comparison to a certain New York senator. The effort to frame the character as Clinton is so transparent, it would be ridiculous by itself if the character wasn't ridiculously cartoon-like in partisanship. Needing to demonize a sitting senator in order to make an effective protagonist doesn't say much about Thor's imagination or character development. After a few chapters the wink and nod partisan commentary got old. If you have Ann Coulter on your bookshelf, you may get a few chuckles as Thor gleefully tries in indoctrinate readers, but others who don't share the neo-con ideology will likely find many distractions 
 I expected much more from this book. I'm not really sure why, though, because we formerly used the Gallup test to select our  sales people. This could have been a good book. But the authors seriously miss the mark. They are clearly more interested in selling their own version of a sales test than giving sales people useful information. Most of the information they do share is not new. It's the same old stuff you get in Marcus Buckingham's Gallup sales brouchure also marketed as a book. The biggest problem with Benson and Rutigliano's book is the airy fairy untested psycho fluff they're trying to float as established scientific discoveries. The two authors are both Gallup's hired hands. They say successful salespeople are successful because they share one common trait. They "use their strongest aptitudes" to succeed in their work. "Strongest aptitudes?" Where haven't we heard that one before? What about intelligence and motivation and values and skill development? This book reads smoothly but won't work in practice. I know because we used to use the principles marketed in this book. But the selection mistakes proved too costly as we found out they also did for other users. Forget about the strenthfinder test this book touts. The book is an undisguised phising expedition for more people to take their sales test. But who cares? Does anyone still think you can trust surveys collected on the web? There are plenty of excellent books out there for sales people. Miller and Heiman, Tony Parinello, Spin Selling (one of my favorites), Dudley and Goodson (another favorite), Zig Ziglar, Huthwaite, these are the books salespeople should be reading 
 I am a fairly active woman and a physician.  I jog or treadmill daily and have been a yoga fan for years.  I tried this video for the first time at 22 weeks, and literally could not get off the floor after I finished.  I have had to see my OB and a chiropractor for a sprained sacroiliac joint.  The isolated leg movements basically caused me to sprain my pelvis.  In addition to being unable to walk and having to give up exercise *entirely* for several weeks, I've spent hundreds of dollars seeking treatment for this injury.  If you're in your first trimester, or really used to pilates, maybe you can try this, but given the amount of relaxin in pregant bodies and the propensity for joint laxity, I am sticking to yoga and staying away from this or any other pilates tape 
 this is no SAW 85-92 as some people compare it to. Oh, no. This is a largely unfulfilling listen. The tracks all sound too similar. I realize Richard's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear, but the drum programming and harmonic "development" is lackluster. Only track worth burping over is the last one... XMD something. Has he been taking piano lessons since Druqks? For those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch, check out Nick Forte's new release "young man's disease" which is better than anything else i've heard this year. 
 While I agree that Lynn Hill may be an inspiration to many women climbers, I felt that the book was very poorly written.  I also concur and can not understand how this book achieved a rating of 5 and 6 stars.  It highlights some events of Lynn's climbing in her lifetime but it doesn't capture the soul of climbing.  I also felt some arrogance with her writing where most of the writing were concentrated on the negatives of others' climbs while in some instances she had the same.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner or a inspirational women's climb 
 I'll leave comments about the value of this movie (which I love) to other reviewers.  what I want to warn buyers about is the rediculous lack of features on this DVD.  There are, literally, NONE.  There's not even a language menu for close captioning... it's essentially like buying a VHS tape that's been transferred to DVD.  Don't waste your money 
 This book does not contain the gifts of the Catholic faith, but instead is a new age spiritual treatise of total, unqualified tolerance. What comes to mind is the old phrase "if it feels good, do it".This is exactly  what is wrong with society. Too much of doing one's "own thing".  Nothing about obedience and belief in what will strenghten us through mid  life is contained in the book. Do not read this book if you are looking for  the answer to your mid life crisis.One thing about reaching fifty is that  you can cut through the mustard and see a hidden agenda under a guise of  honesty.This book will not lead one to their home, but farther away into  confusion 
  I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course.  I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later.  The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive.  Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly.  It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid.  The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing.  The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.    I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico.  It sadly shows.   He has little understanding of Mexico.  I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work.  If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven. 
 I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with this album. Several places "Triangle" has been referred to as a classic album and as the best album by the band. It does feature several fine strings-arrangements by Van Dyke Park, but the overall lack of real good songs, makes the album a pretty dull experience.  Actually the first song that really stirred my attention was Randy Newman's "My Old Kentucky Home" and by the end of that song, the album was over. A few more songs like "Magic Hollow" and and the title track lift themselves above average, but not enough to make the album really interesting. 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 I really enjoyed Kelly Wearstler's Modern Glamour, but found this book to be disappointing.  There's no text, only seemingly self-serving photographs of her and her gowns in her over-designed house.  The only thought I had while flipping through the pages was how difficult it must be to keep it dusted!  I would have been much more satisfied were there some explanations as to how she might have come to some of her design conclusions, because to me it all seems cluttered and complicated, and somewhat random.  I guess that's part of the appeal, but I expected more text and fewer images of the woman herself.  One quick flip through this one is enough - borrow it from the library 
 More mindless dribble from a writer whom Amway helped make thousands of dollars by writing a book that is required reading for all new distributors.  To give you a hint, Amway is now on the web under the name of  to hide who they are; a website where you can purchase toilet  paper .         Nowhere does the writer talk about  the hundreds of lawsuits that have been filed against Amway, that most of  the money in Amway is through the sale of books and tapes created by  organizations independent of Amway, or the thousands of people deceived  every year.  Don't waste your money on this book:  instead read False  Profits by Fitzpatrick 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 poor album. the song 'rocks' is almost identical with any songs of Black Crowers, and even they look alike.and i can't believe is Primal Scream i'm hearing. Primal Scream really has something better to do 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 as a transmasculine, genderqueer person, i found this book offensive. valerio adopts socialized male sexism and then justifies it as a product of hormones. it is full of objectification of women, trivialization of women's emotions (at one point, he attributes the fact that a girlfriend has accused him of sexism to pure "jealousy"--instead of actually interrogating and examining this accusation in a serious way) and straight-up misogyny. the book is also extremely heterosexist--much of what valerio uses to define a man is his heterosexuality and attraction to women.  of course, i should not have expected otherwise--in the introduction, valerio establishes himself as someone who loves the binary and gender roles. i can't lie--he gave me fair warning for what i was about to read. i give it 2 stars because for anyone considering going on testosterone, it is an important perspective. but i warn that it is offensive, old-school machismo. it feels to me like it would be offensive to ANYONE who loves and respects or is a woman 
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 Rather than providing us with an impartial, well-told narrative of space exploration, Burrows apparently feels the need to tell the story of virtually every political and bureacratic battle dealing with NASA.  He  spends little time writing about the actual space missions; instead, he  spends the majority of his time with some potted political commentary that  I saw as irrelevent.  He also feels the need to tell us his opinion on  several issues, displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of space  exploration and its benefits.  Even its description of the greatest events  in the history of spaceflight are brief and dull.  He tells the story of  Apollo 11 in about a page in a half, while Apollo 13 gets about a page  because Burrows felt the need to mention the lack of interest in  spaceflight at the time, rather than mentioning Lovell, Haise, and  Swigert's epic return to earth.  He also says that the Apollo spacecraft,  during the Apollo 13 mission, was described by Jim Lovell in his  autobiography, Lost Moon, as "downright dangerous."  Lovell was  referring to the spacecraft at the time of the Apollo 1 fire, not Apollo  13.  I would not recommend this book, except if you are interested in  hearing of the political and bureacratic issues facing NASA 
 I was looking for more information.  Thought it was over priced for what I got 
 I selected Time to Hunt after reading the thrilling reviews I read here. Boy, was I in for a thrilling disappointment. Though I  forced myself to finish reading Time To Hunt; I found the story to be flat out dull, boring, if not moronic in the descriptions used for the characters. I found nothing interesting, nor thrilling about Time to Hunt, it was just a complete of my reading pleasure 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 I was excited to receive this book. I am a red head and have an infant son with red hair too. This book was very boring. I hung in there hoping it would get better but soon found myself skipping pages. It did not hold my interest and didn't seem to make much sense. I have a red headed girlfriend that I was going to pass it on to but after reading it I have changed my mind. The cover is attractive so therefore it makes a good coffee table book 
 This book was absolutely useless.  I used this book in 1999/2000 and found the majority of the information contained in this book to be inaccurate or very outdated.  I encountered numerous situations where services, i.e. trains, buses, hotels and museums had closed down or not existed for up to 10 years in the past!  The 2nd addition did not update any of even the most basic of information.   After countless experiences of "wrong advise/info" I tossed the book.   Please bear in mind that I lived in Mexico for one year and traveled extensively during this time with my Mexican wife. Buy any other book but this one! You have been warned 
 This is a wonderful book for those kids who either have parents paying off all their teachers to pass them or the students that sleep with the right people to pass. Oh, and I don't sit in my room on Saturdays playing card games, either. But having fun doesn't mean "get drunk 24/7 for four years". There's something called HAVING A LIFE that this book totally misses but, well, it's for college kids, and they're mostly idiots 
 I am a huge fan of Jo Beverely, but this had to be one of the worst books I've ever read. (Sorry)  Leander wasn't even in the same league with the other rogues.  All the other rogues were intriging and so were their stories 
 I wish I could take the time back I wasted on listening to this bands albums so I could use it on more productive things like lighting my nipples on fire. I would have enjoyed it more 
 I thought that this book was very harsh and critical of some groups of people.  I thought that it was quite insulting to men and whites.  I thought it was well writtten, and i loved the first couple sections about  Walker's ideas of activism rooted in love, but i found that as the book  progressed it seemed to become more of a praise of certain kinds of people  rather than praising all people and loving all people like it was claimed  earlier in the book.  Overall, Walker had good ideas, I just found that  sometime they were expressed in a manner of insult 
 Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found "Truth" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass 
 I have read several of Mr. Dickey's books and really enjoy them, however this one sas a disappiontment. A friend whom read this book said it was a great read but I would have to disagree. I was expecting it to end differemtly than it did because I already had a idea about how it would end before it did. I really found the ending boring, but i still intend on reading Mr. Dickey's other books 
 I tried to read this book after the death of my Dad due to a long battle with cancer.  This author can only "help" or more accurately share stories of how dysfunctional her relationship with her father was, and how promiscuous she was, what a bad friend she was to those around her, rather than actually tell you anything about what life is like after the death of a father that you had a healthy relationship with.  If you are normal and your father is normal, and you were friends with your father, this book is not for you.  If you need therapy and your Dad needs therapy, here is clearly the book for you.    This book is full of sweeping generalizations to validate the author's bad decisions in the relationships in her life.  It is not backed up with any research or facts of any kind.  She should have bought a journal and written about the bad relationship in private rather than publish it.  Please do not buy this book 
 Marry anne's dad and Dawn's mom get married.  This is a good book to read but would you really be that happy to have to move into a house with your best friend?  And I know I would not want my dad to marry my best friend's  mom especially if she had been divorced before.  But overall it is a good  book that goes pretty quickly 
 This book is impossible to learn from unless you know c++ like the person who wrote the language.  I am using this book for my data structures class I'm in right now and it is useless.  Our teacher is constantly finding things that are against normal convention.  The code is very incomplete.  Don't worry though, cause if you don't know c++ very very very well, you'll never even realize it.  I compare his homework problems to teaching someone how to paint a bird house and then asking him how to build a skyscrapper.  You should definetly avoid this book at all costs 
 Well, when a dust-jacket calls your book the "literary love child of Stephen King and Annie Proulx" I guess that's already throwing you under the bus but seriously, this book was a MAJOR let down.  I had to force myself through the pages all the way to the last one where most books get the reader trucking right along.  Not this one.  The last 40 pages were just as hard to read as the first 40 pages only they were less believable even for a fiction novel.  I just love the way the Navy has the wireless headsets with a seemingly endless range but had NO technology to notify the community of the evacuation except for a few "Able Seamen" going door to door in a jeep . . . or a helicopter touching down in the middle of the street to rescue the one of the worst characters or the entire story, Miss Laracy.  Tommy Quilty was unbelievable as was Lieutenant Commander French.  This book had so much potential to be excellent and instead it was horrible.  So much emphasis on all the fish spewing weird things from their mouths yet the outcome of the entire book had nothing to do with fish but with the souls of dead fishermen?  HORRIBLE.  Save your money--better yet, save your time and don't read this book 
 this little white janet jackson wannabe is a total sellout and trailer trash with nasly moans for a voice and stiff dancing. And yet 70 million losers bought her records 
 I know it was a memoir and her diary, but it was very anti-climax. I figured there could have been more to the story and it didn't really feel like I was able to "know" her. The whole thing seemed kind of cold and emotionless 
 I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud 
 I was disappointed after the first 30 minutes and realized this was a bad knock off between "The Gospel" and "The Fighting Temptations".  I would not recommend purchasing.  You are better off renting 
 The book is about court poetry, court architecture, court philosophy, and how well courtiers felt cultivating their court culture. It is definitly NOT about the entire culture of al-Andalus. It is not about those who worked and suffered to pay the courtier lifestyle, the dependend farmers, the craftsmen, the merchants, etc. Their music, dance, food, workman skills, etc. is completly neglected. It is no wonder that Ms. Menocal wonders why the court culture was destroyed. Maybe a lot of people were not willing to pay for it any more. Worse, it is not about the international musicians and dancers, the gitanos who breathed life into Spanish culture. The book is written by a bourgois raised and educated in safe homes and university bubbles but definitly not by someone who ever took part in creating culture 
 As "rush to judgment" is the mantra chanted by defenders of the "presumption of innocence" and skeptics of law enforcement, so could "rush to publish" be a criticism leveled at authors who have penned premature books on the Laci Peterson case.  Fleeman's, "Laci - Inside the Laci Peterson Murder," a pulp paperback mass produced by St. Martin's Press in December of 2003, is an accounting of the case from the "disappearance" Christmas Eve of 2002 to the burial of Laci and Conner in August 2003, two months before the preliminary hearing where many clarifying, enlightening and alarming facts would be presented. Fleeman, currently on the staff of People magazine and formerly with the Associated Press, attempts to portray a fairly balanced treatise, based heavily on articles from The Modesto Bee and press conferences, along with selected quotes and opinions from the Peterson family which have not, to my knowledge, appeared in print before.   From this observation, I conclude that the Peterson family was consulted during the research of this book and were compensated for it. Notably absent are statements from the Rocha side that were not derived from previously broadcast or printed media. Whether because of inaccurate sources, ignorance, careless editing, or deliberate spin, the book contains an extraordinary amount of errors.    I am surprised that a professional such as Fleeman would allow this book to go to press without having someone with an informed background in this case proof read it first. To Mr. Fleeman's credit, interspersed as a sort of bucolic relief between recounting the chronology of the grim investigation, a few of his anecdotes about the history of Modesto are amusing. However, Mr. Fleeman's somewhat bland narrative is eclipsed by quotes from the major players in the story, and what few laughs and tears I experienced reading this book were all elicited by Laci or her family, who remain the heart and soul of this tragedy.  Fleeman's main source of information was obviously local news reports generated daily throughout the case by the Modesto Bee, some of which we now know were incorrect in many of the details, based on the flurry of activity and originally accepting much of Scott Peterson's explanations for events as fact. Various recurring descriptions of Peterson "crying, blubbering, incomprehensible," and "focused on the search for his wife," were no doubt contributed by his family, as any overt demonstrations of grief, credible emotional displays, or participation in active searches were nonexistent to the rest of the world. Fleeman relies on Peterson's timeline and other unreliable references for his activities of the 24th, the weather, the number and times of his phone calls, McKenzie's behavior, and Laci's plans that morning.   In his efforts to present Peterson's side of the story, Fleeman traps the defendant in numerous areas of disbelief.   Similar to the articles in People Magazine about the Petersons, Fleeman blatantly misrepresents the clan as "another blended family. Both his parents had three children from previous marriages and, like the Brady Bunch, this brood somehow formed a family when Lee and Jacqueline Peterson got married...He [Scott] was the baby of the family and the joke among the seven Peterson children - five boys, two girls - was that Scott never had to walk anywhere until he was at least age two..." Apparently Mr. Fleeman isn't privy to the fact that Jacqueline's first two children, Don and Anne, were given up for adoption and never met Scott until they were adults; and that Jacqueline, by all accounts was never married prior to Lee.  Other important (or incriminating) details that were omitted in the book include reports of Scott golfing during the searches, visiting the Berkeley area in rented cars only to stare out at the water for a few minutes and leave; and the revelation that a neighbor, Kim McGregor, was responsible for the burglary of Peterson's house while he was in L.A, which were all common knowledge before the preliminary hearing. Curiously, the 8-page photo archive in the center of the book includes no pictures of Laci, not even the ubiquitous "missing" poster. Any biographical information about Laci is derived from her family and friend's interviews with the press and television personalities. If I were writing a book about a murder, using the victim's name as the title, I would make a concerted effort to flesh out her life and history to portray her as a multi-dimensional person, and not merely rely on what has already been written about her.   The philandering and fraudulent Scott, on the other hand, warranted much more illustration, including several references to a golf scholarship to Arizona State that has yet to be confirmed as anything but Peterson family legend.  Regardless of the attempts to swing the anti-Scott pendulum more toward the center, Fleeman's cozying up to the Petersons is glaringly evident in the amount of ink he devotes to their point of view. Besides his propensity to revisit already trampled territory, the author fails to penetrate any source in the investigation on either side, which may be attributed to the fact that most insiders were strictly adhering to the gag order (despite what the defense and Peterson supporters allege), or just didn't trust Mr. Fleeman. After seeing how Fleeman misrepresented some of the salient details that were shared with him by people peripherally involved in the investigation, I'd be surprised if he gets any more opportunities for future interviews with key players (other than the Petersons) when the results of the trial are known and he wants to write another book. Perhaps he should title his next one "Scott. 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-( 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 I got about 40% through it, but couldn't make myself finish this one, since I just couldn't care about the protagonist. Grace Archer is a control freak. That causes her to make foolish decisions. She has trouble accepting help when she's in over her head. If she were family, you'd stick by her. If she's only a character in a book, you might just close the book and say, "Enough!" I did 
 This book is just a compilation of some applications.  However there is no uniformity in the contents. The contents appear more like conference papers rather than book chapters 
 When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style 
 I don't usually bother complaining about products, but this thermometer was such a waste of $, I just wanted to save someone else the trouble. The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate. EVERY time that we check a temp. it is different, it varies alot. Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got. Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees. It reads low sometimes, so you may have a temperature and not be aware. And we couldn't even take it back to the store. Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.We didn't have any luck with a diffferent brand either, the ear ones are all off, but not as bad as this one 
 This book was a tremendous disappointment.  Many of the "missions" are laughably boring and/or carried out in a stunningly inept fashion, much of the writing is markedly narcissistic in its tone and yet inconsistent in content, and perhaps most disappointing the descriptions of the places where the authors go are remarkably poor.  First, the missions.  The mission to the UN mostly involves trying to get inside by asking for an interview.  Wow, it's like working for my high school newspaper all over again.  Once they're shot down, one member of the team briefly sprints past a barrier and `explores' a plaza outside the building for less than a minute (the main point of which is to hold up the Jinx flag while his friends take his picture).  Another involves staying on the subway even after the conductor announces passengers should get off! - oh the bravery and cunning!.  This is made all the more ridiculous when two non-English speaking tourists inadvertently do the same thing and when the authors do not even get off the train once it's stopped at the abandoned subway station they had planned to explore.  Later, they go into an abandoned house, where they discover that a lot of other people have also done this over the years.  Second, the writing.  Much of the text focuses on how cool they look in their "uniforms" (dark suits and sunglasses), how cool they look walking to their missions, how cool they look on their missions, how cool it is when they all get together and how everybody else in New York are mindless zombies who don't appreciate what is around them because they are trapped in their sad, meaningless lives.  The whole uniform thing is particularly stupid.  There's one throw-away sentence explaining that they wear these uniforms because otherwise "scientists" and "philosophers" will not take their "empirical data" seriously, but you simply can't shake the feeling that they just want to look like they're either in "Reservoir Dogs" or "The Matrix" (particularly when the ridiculous `uniforms' keep attracting attention when they're trying to sneak into some place.)  Throughout the book the authors bounce between stressing that they explore places for the scientific, empirical value of doing so and that it is not at all for a sense of adventure, only then to talk later about how much fun the adventure of it all is (including one author's admission that he believes the other has a death wish and that is why he engages in so many dangerous activities while exploring).  In addition, much space is taken up with various diatribes on the evils of modern life (including a particularly passionate rant against the United Nations that comes totally out of nowhere), and all the horrible twenty-somethings of the world who spend their lives drinking iced coffees (which is a particularly hollow complaint when - a few pages later - the Jinx crew sits down to iced coffees after having screwed up the UN mission).  You almost get the sense that after trying in vain to improve the writing, the publishers finally decided to spin the writing as "witty" and hope that people fell for it.  Finally, the descriptions are no better than what you'd get if you wrote down what you think the locations look like without ever actually going.  The Croton Aqueduct is dark and slippery.  An abandoned subway station is eerie.  When you're on top of the George Washington Bridge, the Hudson River looks a long way away.  And that's about as good as the descriptions get.  Don't waste your time or your money 
 The 1991 "Our Game" is a standalone post cold war spy story by that British master, John LeCarre: and he's written several memorable spy stories, such as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold," and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  This book exhibits some of his virtues as a writer: unsurpassed spycraft, strong set piece openings, and closings; plots that might keep a reader up way past bedtime, sharply drawn characters given snappy dialogue, and engrossing narrative and descriptive writing.  The book opens on Tim Cranmer, forcibly retired British cold war spy; luckily for him, he seems to have more than his share of wealthy relatives,enabling a comfortable retirement as a landed winemaker.  He has acquired a beautiful, much younger mistress whom he keeps in luxury.  And he's been able to place his oldest friend, Larry Pettifer, a friendly rival since Winchester, the elite public school(as the English call it; we call them private schools), and the elite unversity, Oxford, in a job nearby.  Mind you, Pettifer was also one of the deskbound Cranmer's spies, or joes, as Le Carre calls them; he was also a double agent, working for the Russians as well.  Yet there's nobody the cold Cranmer has ever been closer to.  Suddenly, Pettifer disappears, taking with him Cranmer's young mistress Emma. (He tells Cranmer:" You stole my life, I stole your girl.")  Cranmer soon discovers that Pettifer has committed himself to a new cause, for which he's taken with him $37 million Russian that he wasn't entitled to.  Cranmer also soon realizes his former employers at the spy shop suspect him of complicity in the theft; and, what's worse, a ruthless Russsian mafia does, too.  So Cranmer goes on the run, to Paris and Russia, remembering his helpful spycraft all the way, as he looks for Pettifer and Emma, while trying to avoid the parties looking for him.  At one point Cranmer muses: "He /Pettifer/ has been goading me about my indifference to the world's agonies....I have said that I never considered myself responsible for the world's ills, not for causing them, not for curing them.  The world was in my view a jungle overrun with savages, just as it had always been.  Most of its problems were insoluble....I have said that I have always been, and would continue to be, prepared to make sacrifices for my neighbours, compatriots, and friends.  But when it came to saving barbarians from one another in countries no bigger than a letter on the map, I failed to see why I should throw myself into a burning house to rescue a dog I had never cared for in the first place."  Now,unfortunately, readers who find that speech resonant, who perhaps are even saying to themselves some variation of: "Right on, brother, couldn't say it better myself," will have a problem.  Because, for reasons never made entirely clear, Cranmer will suddenly pull a 180 in his beliefs, grab a Kalashnikov rifle, and run off to try to put the world to rights himself.  For such readers, this book might not be the best place to start reading Le Carre.  
 I have read close to 100 Star Trek novels, including four by the Martin and Mangels team. These two guys are consistantly the worst authors of Trek I have read. And mind you, I've read Triangle!  The idea for a Titan series was really exciting to me. Riker and Troi were great characters and I loved Nemesis. This book, and its sequel, however, are an amateurish romp on par with slash fic. They are terrible. The worst Trek novels I have ever read. There are too many characters, most of whom are completely forgettable. Many are, to coin a phrase, illogical. Why would the Federation allow a species into Starfleet who found babies tasty morsels when they were HORRIFIED by the Anticans' diet? Not only that, but the carnivorous baby-muncher is the ship's doctor!  Furthermore, Roddenberry always insisted that sexuality was not an issue in Trek. It is why he never addressed certain issues. That doesn't stop the cast of this novel from running around in a state of adolescent lust and gossip-mongering about who's doing who. Not a Trek quality at all. BTW: That's not homophobia. I completely agree that Trek needs to put a gay character up front (married, too) because that is exactly the sort of social acceptance that \Trek has ALWAYS embraced. BUT not like this. Not when the ONLY notable characteristic of the character is his sexuality. Plus, the gay character is far from the only character in this book running around like a horny 16 year old. Even Ogawa gets in on the hoen-dogging. My final gripe is that Riker and Troi are Mr. and Mrs. Not-Appearing-In-This-Book. They are barely in the novel. Where they do appear, they are not in character. Riker is sort of whiney and Troi is an esteem machine. Its dreadful an insulting to the fans of the characters and the actors who portrayed them. Did I say finally? Oops... I have one more gripe, bigger than the rest- where's the plot? This slow moving gossip column in space spends three hundred pages getting to Romulus to watch nothing happen. It is slow moving, poorly written, and NOT worth the money. Read Peter David's New Frontier series if you want original Trek that lives up to the legacy. 
 I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old. Luvable Friend's onsies are awful. The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review! 
 Anyone who pays full price for this is gonna be pissed. Name one Jock who listens to this crap. I just can't imagine professional athletes listening to Da' Dip on their way to a game. I think these CD's should not be taken seriously because they are way too funny to be for real 
 All hype and nothing substatial.  It's like an infomercial that you have to pay for 
 After loving the first film I saw this terrible sequel. Relizing the potintial of a series I was exited about this movie. Good thing I did not pay money for this! From minute one it was bad, bad cast, bad charectors, bad Bad Guys,and bad story(How many times has mind control been done). Avoid this sequal. 
 Like other reviewers have said, this book was lacking something.  I believe that the book lacked subtlety and therefore was not as suspenseful or page-turning as it could have been.  Sure, the plot was interesting enough, but nothing was left to the imagination and there was so much predictability and over-foreshadowing.    I didn't stop reading it halfway through, but I don't think I'll read any more Philbrick novels 
 I bought several pairs of these about 3 months ago. The price sounded reasonable, and was the best that I had been able to find online, so far. After I finally received them, I wish that I had never even bothered to make the purchase in the first place. They were slower than a snail to ship them, and when I opened them, I could see just by looking, they were mismarked, and way smaller than they should be. So now I am out over $100, for merchandise that is worthless to me. I tried to contact the seller, they have never responded. Don't even waste your time here. YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!! 
 This book was EXTREMELY boring.  I only read it because it was assigned reading. It is kind of like a "Chicken Soup for the Soul" but with 3 pages of physology inbetween each story 
 Pinched my daughter's tush (even though it was opened all the way, it bent as she was getting on). She never went near it again. Have to be very careful as child is sitting down. 
 While I only am a little over half way through this book, I'm finding myself hating Will.  He's pathetic and boring and not at all a character that I can cheer for.  This book has been a tedious read overall.  I keep pushing through because I feel like it has to get better, yet so far it has not.  I'm happy that I checked this out from the library, so that I can return it and not have it collect dust on MY shelves.  The only reason why I'm even writing a review is that I'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far.  I looked on Amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; I'm surprised that they are not.  I usually like this genre of fiction, but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self-loathing 
 I don't dispute that Bose is a leader in speaker technology.  But there is a reason this item is discontinued.  It locks up when playing certain DVDs.  Sometimes after selecting "play movie" it won't get past the menu, you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen.  Other DVDs will play fine, but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the DVD, the next time you turn it on it will say "Bad Disc" and locks up - you can't play, you can't eject, nothing.  You have to UNPLUG it and essentially reboot the system.  Maybe I got the lemon, I don't know.  But it's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name Bose... this system is definitely an exception to that rule 
 I purchased this product for my niece,having had positive experiences with similar items,and finding the price to be too tempting.However,what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset.The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver,the titles suffered from redundancy,and many of them required the use of too many buttons.What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed; perhaps fewer similar titles and a re-configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product 
 I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.  If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.  If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot 
 Mr. Tesla should have let someone else write his biography. Granted he was at his peak in the early 1900's, but much of the information he gives out about his life, especially his childhood years, is truly unbelievable - not in a good way 
 When the "principle" author turns the writing reins over to others, the contents of this book becomes worthwhile. Unfortunately, that does not happen often enough. In reading this book I am reminded of the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon where Hobbes asks Calvin why he is not going to school. Calvin replies that he is just going to go on talk shows and hype himself.  Don't buy into the hype. If you do, you are going to feel very lonely with this Administrator's Companion. Scot Hillier's books, although they have a developer focus, offer a lot more than this book does for the administrator. 
 The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Apocalypse The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Visions of the Emerald Beyond  Mahavishnu II was nowhere as good as MI, but it had its good points in this inaugural album, most notably the pristine of electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. McLaughlin still generates the heat but sounds like he is recycling more forceful work from earlier albums. The drumming, bass and keyboards are unexceptional but not notable. There is a pretty vocal solo by keyboardist Gayle Moran on "Smile of the Beyond." All in all, there's too much recycled in this album, the musicians (Ponty and McLaughlin excepted) are mediocre at best, and the Buddhist propagandizing  seems egregious.  But at least it's better than the next album, Visions of the Emerald Beyond, which has almost nothing to recommend it, except for its moments of ersatz funk ("Cosmic Strut," "Can't Stand Your Funk"). 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 I had to wait so long to get this book! The seller did not reply to any of my emails and did not notify me about the shipment 
 Patronizing, dreadful, insincere, badly written book. I cut my losses after about four chapters of this fool's memoir. I don't recommend it 
 I cannot recommend this novel to any reader.  It had too many aspects of the countless, over-the-top feminist rants that are becoming so tiresome.  It was predictable that one of the few decent men in the story was dispatched toward the end so that the women could resume their life together.  The history, the relationships and the settings were unbelievable. 
 Although his interesting childhood kept you glued to the first quarter of the book, the rest is just a basic cowboy's life written with little or no techniques to keep you compelled to read every word. It is interesting to read, however, since he was a true to life cowboy. If I had to do over, I'd saved my money. 
 Be Careful! It is just a CD including an Excel File. You need to have two other add-ins installed to run the file. I can't judge how flexible this model is. But I couldn't apply this to my current valuation class in MBA program 
 In 8th grade this year, we were assigned to read the book, To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. When reading this book, we were asked to choose another book to read independently. I chose Gorilla My Love, by Toni  Bambara. I found that Gorilla My Love and To Kill A Mockingbird share a lot  of the same themes, in particular, racism. 	In this collection of short  stories, Bambara writes every story through the eyes of a poor black girl,  growing up  during a difficult time and in a rough urban neighborhood.  Through every story, we are able to understand how an African American girl  feels, during different times of her life.  	In both of these two  books, racism is a large issue. However, it is told from two very different  perspectives. To Kill A Mockingbird  is told by a young white girl, and  Gorilla My Love  is narrated by a young black girl. Both the characters in  these two books are very aware of racism, however, the narrator  in Gorilla  My Love, takes the issue more personally. Bambara relates to the issue much  more than a character like Scout. A White person can easily say "racism is  wrong," but they could never understand how a Black person feels, for they  have to live with the feeling that someone hates them, everyday if their  lives. 	Every story in Gorilla My Love, is a clip of the narrators  point of view on the subject. In the story "My Man Bovanne", Bambara mocks  the Black community by portraying a mother as "a b**** in heat" while she  dances.  	However,  in the story, "The Hammerhead", Bambara takes the  issue of racism very seriously, when her brother is sent to a mental  hospital for playing basketball on a court that the white officers claimed  as theirs. Bambara makes the reader aware of how a Black person would  handle a situation.  	Reading these two books at the same time was very  beneficial. Reading about the issue of racism and hearing it from two very  different points of view, helps me better understand it. Hearing how both  sides of the situation helps me create an educated opinion of my own. I  really enjoyed reading these two stories 
 It seems as if authors and publishers have decided to sell something that is marginal at best, just include the words Power,Prestige, wealth all seemingly offering some simple strategy to imporove and empower your life, Power talk fails to live up to its title. It is a ok book on how we talk and what the 2 distinct communication styles are all about. But it doesnt take a 200 page book to tell us that the key is to merge the two? This book is geared towards salespeople and corporate executives, if you work for a firm of 20 or less this probably won't help much. The key to success is adaptation to the enviroment your in rather than discuss key words or stratagies for enhancing vocabulary, structure , etiquitte this book just rehashes the adaptation philosophy. Probably great for some but the majority will just be wasting their time with this title 
 I bought this book based on backcover info. What a disappointment. It's not just that it is poorly written and unimaginative. Unless you are into sleazily written sex and gore, you won't find much to hold your interest. There is nothing new here. Just tired, sorry, second rate prose, thinly drawn characters in a porno-lite storyline. Save your money 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger 
 We purchased this blender at a local home improvement store, thinking the well-respected name, 600 watt motor, and glass pitcher would equal one heavy-duty machine.  It looks great!  But, it stopped working mid-way through the second batch of frozen drinks!  Didn't have it turned "ON," I was using the pulsing feature.  So, called the Customer Service number, and they said I could send it to them for repair or replacement in two weeks.  The reatiler was 10 minutes away, so returning it there was no big deal.  The second time around, the blender again stopped working during the second use.  I made the children some banana milkshakes, rinsed the pitcher out, to make some strawberry frozen drinks for us.  The darned thing stopped working again! Called Customer Service about it and they gave me the same story.  So, back to the home-store . . .   Take three . . . new machine . . . made one batch of our favourite frozen drinks again.  Poured two glasses and left the rest sitting in the pitcher for seconds.  When I came back for seconds, I wanted to tap the pulse feature to re-blend the drinks . . . but, the thing wouldn't work!!  Back on the phone to Customer Service.  They suggested I check their website and select another of their "fine blender line."  YEAH RIGHT!!!  They also said that "maybe you got a 'bad batch'."  A "bad batch" of blenders?   Several things can be learned here:  I enjoy frozen strawberry drinks too much, my local home improvement store has great customer service, and THIS BLENDER IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!! 
 I've read The Other Boleyn Girl and a great deal of Philippa Gregory's other works and found them to be thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down.  It is therefore unfathomable to me that she could have written such a disgusting, morally-repulsive "novel" (and I use the term loosely)such as this.    This book is about a woman's desperate need to retain control of the land she grew up on.  Land which, by legal rights, passed to her dimwitted, sexually depraved, mouse of a brother.  The incest scenes are rife and horrifyingly detailed.  I could not bring myself to even finish this book, and I certainly was not about to read the final two in the trilogy.  If you have even the smallest thread of moral fiber...run the other way.  This book will make you ill 
 If you liked the original theatrical release (which was the first version of the film that made it to DvD) and own it, more than like you have all you'll need from KoH. I REALLY enjoyed the theatrical release, purchased it...and then later bought this version of the film based on many of its Amazon reviews. While it does add a great deal of watching time to the film, the extra footage really does little to improve the quality of the story or increase the depth of the characters to any "interesting" degree. Add to that, that this version of the film doesnt include the great documentaries(History Channel) found on the original DvD release. As I have shared, I REALLY enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven.....but didnt/havent found the purchase of this version to be an improvement over the original in the least. More doesnt always equal better.... 
 "Stunning Sentences: The Effective Writing Series", by Bruce Ross-Larson, NY: WW Norton & Co., 1999 - ISBN 0-393-31795-1 PB, 94 Pg. (8.1" x 5.5"). It (book) actually started on pg. 13, two Exemplars used 10 pg., & finally "Sources" consumed 14 pg., -- so you only get 58 pg. as a brochure or booklet (not a book).  "Stunning Sentences" covers:  Approach, Common Form, Short Form, Dramatic Flourishes, Elegant Repeats, Credible Quotes, Conversational Injections, Stark Attaches, Deft Connects, & One-syllable Openers.  (Author's 'Injections' seemingly variant interjections & asides).  Author offers "hundreds of sample sentences cataloged by type" & "this book will show you patterns...in good writing"...& "how you can...write with precision & eloquence."  The author offers "many tools...to create...rhythm...& balance...& build...individual style."  Author reports his credentials as "Founder of the Amnerican Writing Institute", but his booklet (at least for me) missed its mark & was neither inspirational nor elegant.  What I learned was the author's preoccupation, praise & prediliction for:  "The Economist" (74 citations), "New York Times" magazine" (44 cit.), "New Yorker" magazine (15 cit.), "New York Times" (10 cit.), "New York Book Review" (8 cit.), & a few others.  Why any author would choose to fill 1/4 of a booklet with such extensive citations is unreasonable (unless to avoid plagarism) & is not evidence of originality (perhaps novelty was sought?).  Alternative?  If you desire help on writing skills do consider:  "The Little Red Writing Book" by Brandon Royal -- it has much more to offer (see my recent review on "TLRWB") 
 One minor problem for me, that is evidently not a problem for many others, was the art.  I was put off by the blotchy, surrealistic, color-schemes, which were distracting, and rarely added to whatever charm the line-drawings themselves possessed.  Getting past that, I was able to enjoy the silly story.  Humor is often generated when the tension is created by horror or fear, but then is punctured by the absurdity of the situation.    All decent people should be horrified by the idea of buying and selling other human beings, in pursuit of materialistic goals, as though they were mere objects.  Here, however, the absurdity of the situation breaks the ice.  We know that virtually no real child would want to sell his or her father.  Moreover, the idea of this rather useless dad permitting himself to be bartered all over town by children, without ever once looking up from his newspaper, is completely nonsensical.  I suppose children might laugh (just as I did).  Another saving grace is that, even though the story is told from the point of view of the creepy little sociopath of a son who sells his dad, there were other characters for me to root for.  I was completely on the side of the little sister, who (quite properly) objects and protests the scheme.  She (quite properly) rats him out to his mother, who is also suitably furious, and makes this creepy little materialist promise never to sell his dad again.  Morever, since the bulk of the story concerns the quest to RECOVER the bartered-off dad, even the boy is doing the right thing for much of the narrative.     But then comes the TWIST.  You see, he never promised anything about not selling his little sister.  The last panel shows the brother's huge shadow, mouth open with glee, reaching like an ogre for this little girl, who looks small, isolated, helpless.    This time, I did not laugh.  Why not?  This time, sadly, the absurdity of the situation does not puncture the horror.  It is not absurd enough, and it is too horrific.  We do not think the boy is joking.  Earlier in the tale, we actually saw the little sister bound and gagged by the older brother to prevent her ratting on him to Mom (a disturbing enough scene in its own right).  Moreover the pictures make the boy look much larger and stronger than his little sister --  the situation lacks the obvious jokiness of bartering off one's much-larger dad while he never looks up from his newspaper.  Even the THREAT of selling your little sister to your friends is potentially a nasty and frightening form of abuse.      Gaiman's afterword tells us the story reflects real and bitter hostility that existed between two of his children, and further reflected a similar bitter hostility between himself and his own sister.  This eerily suggests that the final panel might have been inspired by genuine malice.  How, then is it a joke?  If bitter hostility between siblings is a problem -- and it often is -- ought not the message, in a picture book ostensibly marketed for children, be a bit more positive?  Payback time, little girl!  I guess she shouldn't have ratted out her creepy older brother.  Funny to Gaiman, perhaps, but not to me 
      This mattress is very very hard. I have tried many memory foam mattresses in the retail shops and expected something similar. It is not. I slept on it for 13 days until I gave up. They charge a 20% restocking fee and the shipping is outrageous so returning it is out of the question. It comes vacuumed packed from the factory. How are we supposed to return it when no one will ship it after it is opened?? It now lies (sleeping peacefully) in my daughter's abandoned bedroom 
 I really do congratulate Bill Rancic for being HIRED by one of the richest man in the world. But being hired does not mean that Bill Rancic just became the next Bill Gates or Warren Buffet.   Great to know that you take yourself VERY VERY highly Mr.Rancic. your going to fit fine in the Trump Organization, But seriously dont over do yourself.  I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book 
 This book reminded me why there are certain authors I refuse to read because of their lack of respect for the craft and art of writing. Gonzalez has been added to my list.  Can you say "redundant?" The author flips back and forth on different pages covering the same ground as before, leaving one wondering if the author is in the moment or in the past. Distracting, to say the least.  Can you say "cardboard characters?" I must admit Diana was well-developed, but the rest of the characters, even the main ones, were hardly more than a name. There didn't seem to be much, if any, characterization to give one a sense of who they really were and have the reader empathize with them.   Can you say "too many people" crowding the plot? Characters appear and disappear at the turn of a page, leaving you scratching your head as to why they showed up to begin with. Two of the characters even had the same name. Relatives appear out of the woodwork: cousins, in-laws, nephews, nieces, grandparents, children - in short, all the furthest reaches of blood and marital relations.  The action is slow, especially when wading through toward the end. Just like a horror movie on TV, some of the most important characters do really stupid things, jeopardizing not only their lives but the lives of others. Other elements of the plot are unlikely - like the mysterious stranger who shows up to explain everything.  The only reason I gave this book 1 star is that the paper it was written on must be worth at least that much 
 I've enjoyed many of Simmons's novels. But I had difficulty finishing this book. It seemed an exercise in suffering. Too often I read passages that seemed cut and pasted about the crew, the harsh weather, the bitter cold, the threats.... It became an exercise in futility.  There is also a weird sense of the Noble Savage in the role of a female eskimo that is seen as a dangerous, eroticized object and witch. Even more disturbing is some homophobic elements - I'm not saying the author is homophobic, but there are passages in the book where the good gay men are sexless and intellectual and the bad gay men are randy beasts. Thats a very odd view and it troubled me greatly 
 While much of the information is correct there are glaring mistakes throughout. The authors seem to rehash the same words from other publications, neither bringing something fresh nor accuracy to this story. I feel if someone is going to write, whether for an elementary school child or a academic society they need to do their homework first and make sure their facts are straight. The pepuation of heresay with no substantiation is just not right 
 At first this thing was great, in 20 minutes (not 15) it would charge the batteries.  The problems came later when batteries started showing up as "bad" according to the charger, even brand new ones.  A few at first then a lot more.  I have other travel chargers that would charge the "bad" batteries over 8 hours and they would work fine.  Often after this the Energizer charger would charge batteries previously identified as "bad."  After about a year I discovered that the charger was destroying the batteries.  New and old, they would end up bad after a few cycles through this charger, so that even the slow chargers would not charge them.  Many times the charger would not charge them at all, just wait 20 minutes and turn green as if they were done.  Not good when you discover dead "charged" batteries while taking pictures on vacation.  I'd recommend going with slower chargers, inconvenient as they are.  The super fast charge time has destroyed a few dozen expensive NiMH batteries.  I'm looking for one that'll charge a dozen at once....if they make one that is 
 The scooter came with broken brakes. After numerous phone calls to Razor, they sent the wrong part. They dont answer their phones during their open hours and the customer service is a slap in the face. Buy another brand! 
 The high-tech commercial cooking surface began to come off at the third use of this griddle. I don't know what Evenheat means in their product description, but this griddle has a hot spot on the left side. I'm in the market for a new griddle, but I won't buy anything labeled Broilking again

 The first CD in the package is a "Greatest Hits" CD.  The second CD in the package was nothing but unheard hip hop stuff and a couple of her hits with the hip hop rythm added to it. Wished I hadn't bought the CD and spent extra money on it 
 The advice he gives men and women is ludicrious.There again  working off sterotypes.No one in this day and age should be  told it's ok to have random sex.Of course he aims this at the male because it his warped mind only men go on a ramage after  a bad relationship.Women do too but it's left out of the book because as we all know he believes women are love starved  junkies only craving romantic attention and romance.He also believes,wrongly,that women are the most hurt,oh yes,that  self worth and waves coming again at the woman.He views women as somehow half a person without a relationship while a man can build up himself financially and socially,if not sexually after a break up.Women are the downtrodden in his view,the victims. Save the poor little women from themselves is what I hear coming from him.When it comes to men,he is right there ready for an ego boost saying,you can do it.He comes across as an over protective father with the women.He has some need to see women as needy,pathetic love junkies 
 I bought this book because of a recommendation.  I viewed some of it at Amazon and it seemed to be a book that would be of value, but, alas, a total waste.  The author has an apparent agenda and his own biased attitudes though he claims not to.  I have no objections to his view that to be healed we need to turn things over to Jesus, but the way he goes about presenting issues leaves me angry and frustrated.  The author and I were born in the same year and experienced many of the changes our society has undergone during that time. (Nee 1944) I feel he would be more comfortable if we could all go back to the 1950s when men were men and went off to war and did the manly thing by their families, etc.  If only men were the men they used to be.  Men need to get into boots and levi's and their trucks and be real men again, though with the proper Christian spirit. The very name of the book is strange.  I didn't think a soul had a gender!  It would have been better to have been entitled something like "Healing the Male's Self-Image" or "Discovering the Real Male in You"  But whatever title he gave it it would have left me feeling the same.  He is too full of stereotypical images and impoverishes the reader because of it.  He judges all by the men he has personally encountered. I would rather give this book a zero star rating but Amazon did not give me that choice. It doesn't deserve a one star rating 
 Does this man ever tire of tooting his own horn? He writes reams of paper on his terrible POW experiences and how courage matters. Yet he refuses to protect the people of his own state (AZ) from the huge onslaught of illegals from Mexico. Illegals are committing crimes and destroying personal property. They are also desecrating the vaunted natural landscapes that liberal environmentalists are always screaming about.(BTW, why are these liberals suddenly mute about this destruction???) McCain's fellow citizens are arming themselves for protection because illegals are increasingly emboldened by our own govt. He hooked up with Chappaquidick Kennedy to author the McCain-Kennedy illegal rewards act which essentially grants amnesty to 20+ million illegals. Bush signed a bill (a televised PR ploy) to build a 700-mile fence along the border - yet this effort remains largely unfunded. Heard anything about it lately? He sent a few thousand National Guardsmen to the borders but they aren't armed and are apparently filling out forms and other ineffective busy work. Does this make sense??? Why did our govt allow illegal immigration to continue unabated for more than twenty years??? They KNEW what was happening yet stood mute. McCain is known for his arrogance and quick temper. This was demonstrated recently as he addressed fellow Arizonians about the border problem. (Paraphrased)'...They are here to pick lettuce...you (Americans) won't pick lettuce and do you know why my friends? I'll pay you $50/hour to pick lettuce! You won't do it because you CAN'T do it!!!...'With "friends" like McCain, who needs enemies??? I called McCain's office requesting info on how I could get the $50/hour lettuce picking job and received no response. How dare this man speak to his constituents in this manner! McCain (Bush, Kennedy, etc.) are good examples of arrogance in govt - they answer to no one and they do exactly what's good for their pocketbooks and/or their reelection efforts. I don't know why Arizonians aren't demanding this cocky politico and his comrades do something to actually protect THEIR rights over those of a bunch of shrill, militant illegals. Not that it would do any good. After all, they MUST have the "Latino" vote 
 design of book is very poor--pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story.  The translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex 
 I don't know if everyone's standards have changed so much because of text messaging "shorthand" or what, but I found this book to be nearly unreadable.    There are spelling and grammatical errors on what seems like every miserable page.  Apparently synonyms (like "steel" and "steal") are a concept Mr. Bourne never mastered - that and the compound sentence. The text is stilting, truncated and abrupt - absolutely no "flow" in the writing style.  I feel like grading this book like my high school english teacher used to do and sending it back to him; maybe he could learn something.  Do me a favor, Mr. Bourne, and use a spell checker.  Lastly, this reads more like an outline for a book than a book itself.  It doesn't even read like a journal or diary.  There is no character development, no dramatic tension, no identification with the characters.  It's more like reading a police blotter or a duty officer's log.  This book is horrendous.  Give it a miss 
 somehow i can't avoid making comparisons to the last franz ferdinand and brian wilson albums. it's weird what industry gets hyped regardless of whether it's old burnt-out dinosaurs or young fresh ones. i like this enough to hope the earlier works are better, as people seem to suggest. there are some moments here...especially towards the second half that do start to creep in but not nearly enough to suggest permanent "genius" status. my favorite songs were two nations (the least personal track)  and never went to church (the most-personal track). for the most part this (like most of today's rap) makes me simply miss the old likes of x-clan, poor righteous teachers....public enemy...and even good old eminem. mcc 
 This is one of those catch-all biographies that attempts to throw in everything including the kitchen sink and fails in all regards.  The author, D. J. Taylor attempts to connect Orwell's writings with his life but spends so much time on trying to find little kernels of truth in the authors mundane diary entries that he accomplishes almost nothing.  Since Taylor has no ability to write critically about Orwell's works he should have focused on the details of Orwell's life which are easier to record.  Also one gets the feeling that Taylor isn't a fan of Orwell's writing and has little simpathy for his weaknesses in character. So why write the book 
 Hi, I have all the 3 famous book of Kevyn Aucoin (Making Faces, Faces Forward and this) and this one is the worst. Why is this the most expensive? I don`t understand 
 I had an S5000 but it dropped it and broke. So I decided to buy this model since I loved the S5000 so much. They took away so many of the great options and quality that the S5000 had...so now I just use a small Fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf. It is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control. I would suggest going with the S5000 even with lower Megapixels it is much better quality 
 I don't know about this book!  I wouldn't recommend i 
 Since the credits indicate the screenplay was written by Delpy and Hawke along with Linklater, maybe it's too much to expect that self-absorbed actors would be able to accurately write about real and interesting people. While Delpy's Celine does have a few sparks of genuine insight (e.g. learning who you really are when you're not distracted by TV, shopping, etc.), Hawke's Jesse relies too much on cliches (e.g. marriage because of pregnancy eventually becomes bad marriage with little/no sex, etc.).   Delpy at least appeared to try to play a flawed but genuine Celine whereas Hawke's Jesse was just too cool. He looked like he had ADHD and could barely wait for her to finish her lines, so he could throw out his single entendres. I agree with the other reviewer who thought the movie felt like a painfully long and awkward date.  What's so irritating about movies like this is how they try to make "real life" seem so meaningless while idealizing some unattainable fantasy--like somehow it's more romantic to experience a few hours of happiness with a complete stranger every 15-20 years while you marry and spend your life with someone you don't really love. UGGHHH!!!   If you want to watch a movie about dysfunctional people, then rent/buy Mike Nichol's "Closer" where flawed but interesting characters are portrayed with sometimes painful realism. Closer doesn't try to romanticize the "love of your life" but rather show that what people expect from love may differ. Maybe Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have never experienced real love, which is why they can't really write about it.  
 It was ok but was not my favorite.. 
 Charles Fort had intelligence, yes. But where do his theories stand now? For instance, his thoughts on the "raining frogs and fish" occurance goes like this: he denied the scientific theory that they were sucked up in a waterspout and made his own: that all lifeforms were created in a giant sargasso sea in the sky and occasionally intelligent aliens dropped them to Earth. He generalizes the entire scientific community in simple strokes, physicists, your doctor, astronomers, chemists, yes, he claims to debunk them all. Is evolution true to Fort? Nope, all life is created in the sargasso sea in the sky: Genesistrine, and is teleported or dropped by aliens to Earth. Crackpot lit 101: Charles Fort 
 This book really is a basic introduction to Lee Enfield rifles.  After ordering books from Charles R Stratton and Ian Skennerton I found Alan Petrillo's book lacking in detail.  I was able to learn more about the Lee Enfield rifle by surfing the web while I was waiting for this book to arrive.  My suggestion is don't waste your money on this book 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Ed Said is dead but his silly writings still continue to be published.  Don't waste your time or money, forget this book 
 This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to "This Love" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists 
 Unlike most other Examples & Explanations Series, this one is one of the worst I have read.  Authors waste too much time on history of criminal law and MPC, and very little time explaining the law.  Common law and MPC are not distinguished and characterized well, and no clear conclusions of law are given.  The example are very plane, without exploring the variety and complexity of real-life problems.  Unbelievably, only 35 pages are spent on homicide, the most common and complex problem in criminal law, and the examples and explanations for homicide are terrible 
 I will agree with that other review that states this headset is uncomfortable.  The ear cushions are fine, but the frame presses into my head quite hard.  I added some padding which helped, but it is still a poor design.  I can't complain about the function though.  Mic is clear and sound quality is good for my purposes.  
 I see nothing special with this sharpener. Used it on a santuko knife with passible results. Tried using my sharpening steel on that knife and got the same results. The steel seems to be more versitile 
 The clock on this product does not work. The light does not shut itself off. These are both things the description said it should do. The only thing it does is stay semi-fogless. This is a rip off, do not buy 
 The care and attention given to character and relationship development in seasons 1-3 are gone from 4-5.  Silly plots, many based on 1980s trends, i.e.: divorce rates, bored housewives in rebellion, aerobics, consumerism made my eyes roll.  The suburban episode was the worst-the first Asian characters on the series were Japanese tourists with big cameras and lo and behold, latent martial arts skills that came in handy at the end. It's like season 4 was all about being campy, and I missed the good writing.  It was such a different direction for the show than in previous seasons. The romance element is inexplicably headed backwards- the character of Laura Holt has practically become an ice queen and Remington is left to make cheesy passes and be happy with a goodnight kiss.  What was up with Laura-abuse in the last Season 4 episode?  Meanwhile, the writers seemed to turn their interest towards beautifying Mildred who has had a fashion transformation. She also delivers one-liners every time she opens her mouth.    I agree that the airline and butler episodes were better. 
 This book is so slanted to the left that I could not finish it because I ended up on the right.The endless accusations of fascism and nazism to the people on the conservative side are tiresome. Gerry has a great novel called "Half moon and empty stars" and that is a book 
 The Mono hits on the first disc were the only ones of any good on this CD with exception of "America" on the 2nd disc. I am very, very disappointed with Columbia for picking out live tracks for the other earlier songs such as "Sweet Caroline" and the tracks they picked - barf! Of all the live performances the man has done, why these? I go with others who have reviewed this as a poor production - buy  the 20th Century one, it's a helluva lot better than this double set 
 After having read the book, I was left with a mixed feeling. The content of the book is OK. Not special, just OK. If this book changed your way of thinking about risk, then this is probably one of your first books you read on the subject. I give the book content 4 stars, since it's decent, easy to follow and fairly complete. Besides that, the author included three good articles at the end of the book, one of which (by Caroline Hamilton) is particularly well-written.  Now for the style. I can only agree with one of the other reviewers regarding the comment he made about proofreading the book. I wonder if the book was proofread at all. There are so many errors and annoyances in this book, it starts working on my nerves fairly quickly. To name but a few:   The writer contradicts himself on several occasions. Sometimes this gets hilarious: - Page 30: [The cost/benefit analysis] is the most important step of any risk analysis process. - Page 35: As discussed in the previous example, the scope statement is the most important element of the risk analysis process. - Page 39: The most important element of any risk analysis process is the recommendations of controls and safeguards... etc etc.   I understand that mister O'Leary is his mentor, but don't tell me five $%^$@ times that he is the Director of the Education Resource Center (pages ix, 12, 13, 65, 66).   The spelling errors are a real pain in the butt:  - page 217: "Aurebach" instead of "Auerbach" (my favorite; it's his own publisher). - page 16: "can shared" instead of "can be shared" - page 36: ".appropriate" instead of "appropriate" - page 43: "their role" instead of "his role" - page 45: "control" instead of "risk" (last word on the page) - page 46: "these" instead of "there" - page 47: "guideline" instead of "guidelines" - page 55: "their" instead of "its" (it refers back to "job") - page 64: wrong comma usage - page 71: "in" instead of "it" - ..... - page 162: "Originizational" instead of "Organizational" - page 217: "Ozierz's" instead of "Ozier's"   The writer uses the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V too many times. Definitions should be reworded, not blindly copied. See pages 7 and 57, pages 47 and 72 etc.  Sometimes bulleted items in the same list have a trailing dot, sometimes they haven't.  I can go on and on.  To wrap it up, the writing gets 1 star. Equals 5 stars. Which will be rounded to 2 stars, simply because of his sloppy writing. If the writing were better, I might give it 3 or 4 stars 
 My tape cassette reads, "Updated for the 90's." Well, on this tape you will learn tired, worn closing lines that were old far before the 90's. My advice, get your hands on a book called THE ACCIDENTAL SALESMAN by Chris Lyttle. He also has a audio sales training products on this website 
 This book was simply not up to Baldacci's usual quality.  The story goes all over the place, but doesn't get anywhere until the last 50 pages.  Even after 200, 300, and even 400 pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going.  I don't mind suspense, but you can stay "suspended" only so long until it becomes boredom.  The main character is the worst one Baldacci has ever created.  One minute she is crying her eyes out, and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear, and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept FBI agents and police.  This is repeated throughout the story.........I would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book.  She makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people, but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers.  By the end of the book I found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid [...] off.    This is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping. 
 Being influenced by this book at an early age robbed me of being distinctly feminine.  Boys and girls are different and to deny that is ignorant 
 The soundtrack does not match the film you are seeing, and it is really irritating. (It's off by a few seconds.) I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more had it been in synch 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it.  
 i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels.  it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it.  this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book.  it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle.  but the result is a less satisfying book.  it skims rather than digs deep 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 Excellent book for the fairy lovers and craft people like m 
 Until I bought several weeks worth of Rayovac Alkaline D cells, I used Duracell Alkaline D cells.    Every week I run a 3-CD changer (JVC _CX-XC370) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes, at the same volume level (Volume #10), from Tuesday to Thursday.  The Duracells lasted all 11 hours (and might last even longer).  In contrast, these Rayovac D cells for the last three weeks (maybe four weeks) have consistently  died during the second half of the next-to-last class (after hour 9.5 and before hour 10). 
 This is the story of Sheriff Bell, an insufferable dullard who won't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil (as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up?).   He's also a world-class boaster, never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife Loretta is. The same Loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals -- which tells me all I need to know about that marriage.  The yakkity-yakking doesn't stop there. An even bigger gas-bag is Chigurh, the motor-mouthed murderer. In fact, he kills people twice. Before he shoots 'em, he bores 'em to death. His weapon of choice: Lectures about coins. (His final kill took so long, I had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage.)  On the technical front, McCarthy does not structure the drama in the Classical way. He chose the Boring way. The majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character (Moss) has a believable goal. McCarthy also omits the obligatory final scene, between Chigurh and his prey Moss, which was the only reason I kept reading the book. No doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader. Expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story, in my case.   What's more, Sheriff Bell has no scenes with either Chigurh or Moss, making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action. Because McCarthy writes good, visual dialogue, he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story. But when the man on the run (Moss) exits the story, there is no other character to invest in, so the plot grinds to a halt. McCarthy cannot resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players.  So, does McCarthy put us out of our misery? No. Sheriff Bell waffles on for pages and pages about Vietnam, not unlike John Goodman's character Walter in the Big Lebowski. And that's it.  My verdict: I hope Loretta runs away with a criminal. Preferably one of them new evil ones 
 All throughtout this book Alex Delaware and his police friend Milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover.  They have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture.  The reader longs for the pair to actually do something.  In the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings.  That is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking.  I read and enjoyed several of the early Alex Delaware books and then quit looking for new ones, now I know why 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 I received this as a Christmas gift and loved the smell of it.  After my second time using it, I broke out in a terrible itchy rash. There is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation.  Do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin.  The smell is great, but is gone after you get out of the shower. 
 Just took the AP Euro exam today- go for the Cliffs AP European History review book instead of this one.  The writing is very hard to read and the review section skims over important facts while covering minute groups and details.  The multiple choice and scoring for the free-response are much more difficult than on the actual exam.  The only good thing about this book is the large amount of practice free-response topics with the answers. Feel like I got a 4 or a 5 with the Cliffs-I'll find out in July 
 What a disappointment!  I requested this book for Christmas, but after about 125 pages I pitched it.  In addition to bad writing, it became clear the author had a political agenda in writing it.  Not that injecting personal points of view is inappropriate; T.H. White does it brilliantly in his Once and Future King and Book of Merlin. It's just that the worldview Jack Whyte advocates is adolescent, ignorant and simplistic.  I won't know how Whyte will treat the complex mythopoeic stories of Merlin and Arthur; I hope with a lot more depth and nuance than he began his series 
 This is a difficult novel to review as it is really three intertwined novellas.  The book is divided into three sections, and the story and the action are very different in each of the three.  This is a tale of the discovery by a team of archaeologists of an ancient Mycaenaen artifact of immense power.  The first part of the story centers around the efforts of the protagonists to smuggle out the unknown artifact.  The explanation developed by Benford here is totally implausible.  The protagonists are trying to steal an artifact (national treasure really) from its country of origin (Greece) during a coup/civil war for no better reason than to prevent it from falling into the hands of a man who made an inappropriate pass at the main character.  A poorly justified, not particularly well written escape/evasion story.  After having successfully absconded with it to Boston, MA, they then try to discover what it is.  This section is, in my opinion, outstanding, and may, for certain readers, more than justify the cost of the book.  Benford writes with incredible accuracy about Cambridge, about MIT and BU, and about how a scientific investigation would proceed if something like this were actually found.  I agree though with many of the negative reviewers that Benford (a physicist himself) describes the object and its physics in too much detail for the average reader.  This level of detail, while of interest to other physicists, detracts from the story for most readers.  The process of investigation into the properties of the artifact by the physicists as described by Benford is, however, absolutely realistic and outstanding, as is his descriptions of the culture and bureaucracy of the Boston universities.  If you want to understand how scientists would study such an object in a science fiction setting, this is among the best that has been written. In the third section, they try to recover the artifact after it was stolen by the baddie and returned to Greece.  The third section is totally brainless, a mindless `let's send the commandos in and blow everything up' story.  Overall, Benford had a good idea with this novel, but it was poorly executed on several levels, and I would not recommend spending your money on this book with the caveat above 
 Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could.  It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff.  The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord, you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds, then  you have to stop and click play again.  I wish there was an option where  you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again.  The other thing is something a little more important.  The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play, its called OLGA.  Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore.  So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else, and thats what they advertise "Play hit songs". So overall, knowing all this I would have shopped around more.  Especially for the price, its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs.  
 I'm a big fan of Peter Bart's books and column in Variety, and Peter Guber certainly has a load of top-tier credentials. I'd really hoped for an insightful commentary on the current state of the movie business - but this isn't it. "Shoot Out" reads like a dozen other entry-level memoirs by bigtime moguls. There's nary an original comment, and (as other reviewers here have noted) too many war stories. "Final Cut" by Steven Bach gives you the story on "Heaven's Gate" far better than Guber and Bart (and they acknowledge as much); Sidney Lumet's book on making movies gives you a far better insight into the director's world and - above all - Frank Rose's magisterial "The Agency: William Morris and the Hidden History of Hollywood" tells the story of the rise of the agencies in far greater detail, with much more insight than do Guber and Bart.     I really had high hopes for this one, but it was a waste of time. Rose's book - and, of course, "Adventures in the Screen Trade" by William Goldman (again, acknowledged repeatedly by Guber and Bart) are essential reading. This sure isn't 
 I have probably read 50 books on self-improvement, sales success and other books that talk about building wealth and succeeding in life.  I listen to Imus every morning, and shut it off whenever Bo comes on.  However, when I received a copy of his book for Father's Day (my mother is an Imus fan, also, and read a good review on the book) I promised myself I would keep an open mind, pretend that the Bo Dietl on 'Imus' is just a 'character', and give the book a thorough and objective read.  Here is my thorough and objective critique:   Bo's book poorly written and edited. Filled with self-serving examples of his career, as well as gratuitous explitives, Bo spends an entire book telling you how great he is.    Jack Welch, Lee Iaccoca, Michael Eisner, Michael Ovitz...hell, even Donald Trump!...didn't come off as brash, self-centered, egotistical and poorly spoken as Bo does in his book.  His material..when boiled down to just 1 or 2 summary sentences...is accurate, but it's already appeared in 100 books on the subject. Bo brings nothing new to the subject, unless you take an interest in how much he spends on clothes.  "Lunchatations" was a term created by a successful person who claims he couldn't always remember the right term to use in certain situations, so he created his own vocabulary.  Read the 'Glossary' at the end of his book and then take 2 Maalox. Pig Latin is more creative and interesting than Bo-itations 
 These "cover ups" are very thin, a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun.  The colors are pretty, but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps.  They are cheap, good thing because I can't imagine what to use them for.  I'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item.  
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Nice, concise book about making things happen for you the way you want them to. Her point is that if you treat yourself well, you and others will treat you as a quality person and you will be happy. However, many of her "solutions" are totally unrealistic for the average person - she has secretaries, lawn guy, babysitters, grocery delivery service, and lots and lots of money to make her life the way she wants it - not too many people have the kind of cash that you'd need to run your life this way. And her insistence on buying quality at any cost is a bit extreme - buying a $500 purse or a $1000 coat so you never have to buy them again does not appeal to me. I like buying a new purse or coat every now and then. She also make the ludicrous suggestion that you if you can't control your impulse buying, get out a $100 bill, spend it all, and then dump your purchases in the Goodwill bin on your way home. Now that's just absurd. Its a good book to get you thinking about you can change your life, but you'll only get so far with this book unless you happen to have a lot of disposable income and the ability to just move any time you feel like it. 
 We design custom homes and sell a custom component package to customers in the USA.  About 15% of my customers are owner contractors and I have worked with over 50 owner builders in the past ten years. This book is deceptive in that it exaggerates the potential savings and downplays the potential pitfalls. A typical custom home contractor has a 15% profit margin based on National Home Builders Association reports, I concur with that as well. Saving 25% is a dream unless you not only act as the contractor but do much of the work yourself. For every successful owner built project I see there are 5 that are a complete fiasco.  Unless you have considerable carpentry and building experience, know how to deal with subcontractors and all the pitfalls of working with them, and have full time to devote to you homebuilding project then don't even attempt to build your own house! Keep your sanity and marriage intact and hire a good contractor.  My experience with owner builders is that they don't know how to negotiate with the trades, they are unaware of the workmans comp insurance and lien pitfalls and in many cases they pay the subcontractors more than they should because of their inexperience.  Save the cost of this book and go to a movie instead.  Unless you are the unusual one in ten owner builder who has all the right skills and the personality to handle a difficult learning curve you would be well advised to look elsewhere for saving money, perhaps building a slightly smaller house with a contractor  would be a wiser option and in most cases the contractor built house will be much better built and worth much more money when all is said and done.  Spend some time doing research on the web about being your own contractor and read about all the horror stories.  You don't make your own car, sew your own clothes, grow your own food, or assemble your television. Use good common sense and realize that owner building you home is a crap shot at best and a personal and financial catastrophe at worst.  The best thing I can say about this book is that it will give you a good overview of the process of homebuilding but it will in no way equip you for the realities of building your own home. There is no substitute for long term experience, this book makes a toad look like a prince, pretty far fetched in my experience 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 ...do people out there actually believe in magic?  Still?  And call it magick, with a "k"?    Please tell me you guys are joking.  Here's an idea... read a book about science.  You might have to start with the basics, but at least it's real 
 This book is like a long mailing list of online publications.  The idea is that you are getting access to markets and contact names that you ordinarily wouldn't be able to.  The problem is this: many of the entries are outdated--email addresses to nowhere, email addresses for queries that no one reads, names of editors that have moved on from the publication.  You're really better off just finding the publications on the web that you'd like to write for and calling them to find out who you should query.  That's all these authors have done here 
 Self-serving and poorly written.  More fluff than substance.  I was expecting more than a mere "hire me" book 
 The articles in this book are great reading.  They provide thoughtful insite on many different topics.  The cases, however, are completely useless without the instructors' manual.  As best I can tell, the  instructors' manual is not available for purchase unless you are using this  book for a class.  Therefore, in my opinion, this book is a poor value  outside the academic world 
 The idea behind this book is that traits of good crime detectives will also be traits of good investment analysts.   This is done by giving small samples of some of literature's greatest detectives.  Then you are to apply the traits you see in the markets.    Mystery lovers will be disappointed.  As you are never given enough information to solve the detective's mysteries.  Nor are you even given the solution as that would spoil your need to read the original.  You instead get choppy pieces that don't really shed much light on anything.  Investors will also be disappointed.  You are told such wisdom as do your own investigations, look at all the clues, keep an open mind, etc.  No one could argue with such logic, however what did you learn from such things that you did not already know?  There are little or no ideas on where to look in the market for opportunity.  There are no strategies discussed that have not been covered in dozens of other books.  It is not that I doubt what the author is saying.  It is that I do not believe much is said that any reader would not already know.  Of course knowing is different than doing, so perhaps someone would read this book and say "Oh yeah, he is right I should not rely on stock analysts" or "Hmmm market psychology would be a good thing to look into" 
 Don't waste your money - this book contains misleading and incorrect information!  There are so many wonderful books on toddler development, don't waste your time with this one!  The author's have a very narrow mind and only give answers that support their idea on how to parent as opposed to addressing the range of normal development and issues that parents face. 
 This book is not worth the money you spend on it.  Out of twenty inputs, there are only two training ideas that are worth any time reviewing.  And, the last twenty pages have one question per page to use as icebreakers.  You could search the web and find more effective training techniques 
 John Hagee is just another tin-horn preacher who has found a profitable niche in peddling his view of the end-times psychodrama. These books contain the usual text out of context Bible quotes and literal interpretations that are unique to Hagee, Hal Lindsey and other end-times hucksters. Hagee serves up the usual hate diatribes against Muslims in this book as well as his idolatry of Israel and its unique role in the end of the world. Hate is an important part of this book and his brand of "Christianity."  He basically will keep writing the same book over and over as long as their are people willing to be duped by his "prophecy". For all the poor people who waste their time and money on this garbage, I am reminded of what Billy Graham said regarding the endtimes: "the world ends when you die. 
 I am a great fan of Jayne Ann Krentz and having met her, can say she is a most charming and interesting lady.  However, this book from 1983 is truly abominable.  I think when publishers decide to reissue an old title that the author should be required to re-read the book and edit/update it as necessary.  Then the publisher should be required to put ON THE COVER a notification that it is a reissued title.  This story is about a man who after a one-night stand with a kindred soul of a female gambler informs her that he is thinking of beating her because she had to reschedule a second date.  He shows up at her home uninvited and displays the most repulsive over-the-top jealous behavior while threatening her, her livelihood and her business relationships.  I simply don't get it -- why would any woman find this type of behavior attractive?  In fact, it's scary and in real life men like this need to be locked up and forced into counseling.  Save your money 
 Beautiful item, mine also arrived with chips on the outside rim. Beautiful set, have not received my refund yet but suspect it is a delay due to the holidays.  
 This book won't help you at all.  I don't even want to give it a star.  I would recommend The lilaguide: Baby Gear Guide and Baby Bargains 
 Abridgements of great works in and of themselves are not a bad thing.  As I read through this volume I could not but help noticing how poorly it reflected upon Freeman's original three volume work.    Douglas Southall Freeman's Magnum Opus is distorted quite significantly in this abridgement.  If you have not read his original work I suppose this volume will suffice.  But why settle?  I frequently come across the original volumes at used bookstores for around $50-$60.    Mr. Freeman's writing is good literature apart from being great history.  Though the original work is dated it still is a magnificient example of historical writing.  Mr. Freeman's work is what got me interested in Civil War history.     
 Sadly, this is just a waste of your money. I can't think of anything nice to say about it. It's sad that a man who has recorded several albums of his own plus numerous hit singles  finds the need to sing songs which his brother, Barry, made famous. I was deeply upset to see that he even recorded Barry's signature song "Words".   Robin has a voice of his own and should try to sing songs fitted for his voice. He needs to step back and realize that one person does not make a Bee Gees. It required all three of them to create the magic.   
 The author took a very negative approach to reviewing Disney.  A bit like the National Enquirer.  
 I ordered this book through a book club. I thought is sounded like a good book that my girls could relate to - it was terrible!The tooth fairy looks scary, and the descriptions of teeth being pulled are awful for kids!  Children are concerned about losing their teeth, if it will hurt, etc.  These pictures and text only added to their fears!! I read "Love You Forever" by this author, and so I thought this would be a gentle, sensitive tale of teeth coming out - UGH!  Once I finished reading the book, my 5 year old said:  "Mom that is just scary. I don't like it!" 
 Made of cheap plastic. Generate loud noise. The switch broke off the 2nd week I got it. 
 My mother sent me this book and a only read it to get her off my back. But, for Chick Lit, it isn't terrible. At least the heroine steps out on her own and feels her independence, and the author does a fine job of capturing the literary warm fuzzies Seattle offers. In the end, the book is largely redeemed only because it is peppered with bread recipes, as the character seems to work her issues out via kneading 
 We have this stroller and aren't really thrilled with it.  In fact, we're going to buy a different double stroller to replace it.  Our children are aged 2 years and 4 months.  While the 3 month old was still in his car seat/carrier, this stroller worked well for him.  He's now out grown the carrier, and we've put him in the seat of the stroller.  The shoulder straps are too tight for him and don't adjust well.  The seat isn't padded well and there is no head support.  Our 2 year old does not like the back of the stroller.  With the infant in the front, we have to keep it reclined, so my daughter has to lean forward if she's sitting in the back.  She hates standing on it because she is very short and she can't see anything.  She would much prefer to sit in the front.  We find that the basket in the bottom is practically useless. We can't reach it so we never use it.  There is no cup holder or tray for the parents.  It is also a bit bulky when folded and heavy.  So, I think that we will put this stroller in storage until the kids are older and get a double stroller with 2 seats for now 
 I bought this for my grand-daughter, and here is my daughter's reviews of how this product is working (or not)  "Hmmmmm.... she LOVES the music more than the potty itself.  We listen and dance to the "potty" song everyday- but there has been little progress with the actual potty.  I think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet.  Otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat.  I think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better. Or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet, so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks.  Thanks, anyway."   I don't find this very encouraging, so I wish I had purchased something else. 
 This book did not live up to expectations.  The discussions of the rounds did not tell the reader enough useful information.  There were a lot of fun to know facts - amaze your friends and all of that - but not enough information on how to use the round, good ranges to sight in the various rounds versus potential uses, reloading insights (best loads, best rifle twists for what bullet weight) and more of that kind of technical information.  That is why I only gave the book two stars 
 This small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover. Yet, I find it unsatisfactory. It meanders in and out of the history of Islam and the Middle East, but loses focus on the way. Subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation, but not really in depth. It is obvious, however, that Lewis knows quite a lot - but still some clear mistakes (or misformulations?) in chronology and factual events mar the picture, and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled. It has some really interesting insights in how the USA became the great enemy of the Islamists, and many details that makes the Middle East history much more detailed than it usually appears. Yet, in walking there and there, it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of Serge Trifkovic, for example. And while Trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the Islamist threat, Lewis merely mentions the threat, but then walks on to something else. And he doesn't really connect the issues of Holy War and Unholy Terror in depth as promised in the subtitle.  Bottom line: While interesting, I suggest to spend time and money on better books. They are out there 
 This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series. It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.  The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from.   The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not 
 Another ripoff, make sure you order expedited shipping or the next edition may be out by the time you order this one. but don't be fooled there is a lot of great material in this new edition.  A lot has changed in business in 2 years.  Students: enjoy the book.  Authors and publishers and dumb professors who keep using the new edition: enjoy screwing broke college students over.  : 
 I'm mystified about how this can be one of the biggest selling HAND volumes. I think "Smoke From A Distant Fire" is passable 70s shlock, but the rest looks pathetically bad. I guess it's "Disco Duck", "Devil Woman", and "Get Closer" that reels them in 
 I had never heard of this author before and picked this book on cd up at the library. It moved at a snails pace, the book jacket made it sound like an inriuging mystery - but more time is spent on analyzing every last detail amongst the characters - finally when something does happen by the 8th cd - its anticlimactic. And althought he main character continually talks about being psychic - she never once has a premonition, other than feeling "spiderwebs" when she walks in a room.  I couldn't wait for this book to end, and I will probably never pick up another book by this author, even though other reviewers say she writes good books. I kept wondering if it would be better, if someone who was not monotone was doing the reading on the cd. That didn't help matters. 
 I bought this book so it would provide me with domain-specific pieces of usability knowledge, but it failed at that. Althought there are concrete examples, there's nothing learn from them, as the explanations are so general they almost seem canned. It just takes basic usability concepts and applies them to popular domains, without going into any depth. And you don't need another book for that. The writing style often feels like a desperate attempt to beef up the volume. This isn't a useless book for an absolute beginner, but Steve Krug's "Don't Make Think" is several times thinner, and will teach you just as much, if not more 
 The book is well written but lacks in breadth of manager case studies. So much of the book is written toward financial institution managers that it has little applicability to managerial positions in manufacturing, engineering, or other disciplines that don't involve motivating people to meet their sales quotas 
 I bought this book and opened it thinking that it wil be the strong version of The Animator Survival Kit, then after just 5 minutes I realized that it was a serial loose of my money because it not worth the money I paid. It has nothing that helps you to animate , is just the story of some Disney old animated movies. And the rest of it is to read a full scale of bla, bla, bla, bla that don't help in anything. But if you are a collector of Disney old stories it will be ok, so before buy it just think if you wanna draw to animate or just collect a big & heavy book with a Disney name on it 
 There is absolutely not one word of substance in this book.  There's not all that much about the warriors and what there is so ridiculous that one is inclined to suspect that the author is putting us on.  The tabloids at the supermarket checkout counter have more substance than this nonsense 
 I got this CD from a local music store and couldn't wait to listen to it. Unfortunately, there is nothing good to say about this mix. Please read the other reviews written by people who have evaluated this mix (including my other reviews) before you make your purchase on this one, and see whether you agree with their taste of music by how they have rated other mixes. You will be surprised to learn that most of the people who gave rave reviews about J.Z Alive mix are not into this type of music to begin with.   I have never come across a compilation as bad as this one. Sure you can force yourself to like it, like other reviewers, but be true to yourself. This comp. did not even give me a reason to want to give it another chance. Usually there will be something, either a good track, an awesome outro/intro mix, a flow or something that pulls you to give another listen to a CD that otherwise you might think "NAAA". J.Z's Alive mix is actually dead; no emotion, no soul, no intelligence, just pure electronic noise 
 DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK unless you are a vegetarian or willing to change to one! I bought this book along with "Fat-Burning Foods and Other Weight-Loss Secrets." The title is very deceiving. While it does give you information on the fat and calorie content on certain foods, it does not give you advice on how to balance your meals if you eat meat; this book is just telling you not to eat any animal product or saturated fats. That's it!!! If you are thinking about either of these books, I would definitely prefer "Fat-Burning Foods and Other Weight-Loss Secrets." It has more information, and it doesn't stop you from eating meat!! 
 First, I'd like to tell the authors that after reading this book,  each of you owe me a few hours of my time which disappeared, worthlessly, from my life.  What starts out as a great idea - a gaggle of writers each crafting a chapter of a novel - quickly crashes into a confusing, poorly played game of "telephone."   You know "telephone" - the kids' game where one whispers something to the person next to him or her and the words circle the room, ending in an incomprehensible string of gibberish?  Naked Came the Manatee is a hobo stew of styles, with each writer leading us through silly plot moves and adding their own characters.  While reading each of these authors might be fun, their collective sum only reveals a bookfull of defective parts 
 I bought this for my 6 month old daughter, all she does is just look at it , you can hardly hear the sounds and she gets bored prteety quickly 
 Where is the big storm?  Where is the story?  I'm still waiting.    I'm a 30 somthing married mom and I just did not get this book.    Not even a good summer read.  
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 I had never owned an All Music Guide and I have been told by fellow music collectors that there are terrific.  Seeing that All Music had just recently published their new guide to R & B and Soul I decided to give it a try.  I must say I was impressed by the extensive detail given to each entry in this book.  You would not only learn the history of an artist or group, but in many cases you got an update as to what the artist was doing nowadays.  This was impressive and distinguishes this book from others I have seen on the market.  The book covers a wide array of genres including rhythm and blues, soul, funk, disco and one of my personal favorites doo wop.   There is one major problem however.  The print is so small that I got a headache trying to read it.  Try as a might I just could not get past this major flaw. I wound up sending it back.  Too bad.  I suspect anyone over the age of 40 will encounter the same problem.  It seems to me that it would have been much wiser to divide this into 2 volumes with print that you could actually read. I would have gladly paid the difference 
 I was hoping to be proven wrong when my husband said, "You're buying the Corrs?  Prepare to be BORED!" but sadly, it was not to be.  It IS boring.  If you're looking for something mellow, bland and sleepy, this is your album.  If you're looking for dynamic modern Irish music, prepare to be disappointed.  
 When Mr. Burnside first got this book published back in 1999, it was probably the best book on the subject, and helpful to consumers. The truth is, though, it is embarrassing by almost any standard today. The editing is non-existent, and that just shows the lack of thought that went into this. It was thrown together, and omits more than it conveys. There are far better choices now; most notably Wes Johnson's "The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook" that just came out. The latter is an outstanding book, well-researched, far more thorough, and much easier to read. It will also save you more money than any other book on the subject that I've read. If you're thinking about buying a manufactured home, do yourself a favor and buy "The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook" instead. You'll be glad you did before the ink on the contract dries 
 The first fifteen pages of Mr. Kaplan's book are nothing but unabashed nonsense.  Mr. Kaplan takes on West Africa from behind his windscreen as he drives from seemingly every airport in West Africa to his luxury hotel in the safe and thank God air conditioned areas of the dark continent.  Kaplan's comments on West Africa are laughable.  Having lived in West Africa for a good part of my life, I have heard such similiar analysis and comments to Kaplan's on Africa and Africans from racist bigots who never bothered to get out of their car or learn the simplest greetings in an African language.  "Oh my, the filth, regardez ca la crasse, comme meme..."  From Mr. Kaplan's analysis, West Africa is going to hell, there is no stopping it. Sierra Leone is basically brushed off the face of the map and Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria are soon to follow.  Mr. Kaplan knows this because he got caught in a few traffic jams in West Africa and all he could see were beggers, young ruffians, trash and some person urinating against a wall.  Yeah, it is troublesome to see the conditions in many West African capitals, but really, to then assume that these peoples are bordering on anarchy and will rush to Europe and the USA to destroy what we have.  Please.  The other articles in the book look dated even a few years after Mr. Kaplan wrote them.  Nice reading, but hard to overcome Mr. Kaplan's colonial mindset, especially in of all places West Africa, where the lingustic, artistic, and cultural wealth is simply overwhelming; a place that is part of the world's wealth of languages and with sincerely fantastic individuals. Yeah a few area boys or gangs are in the mix, mais alors 
 Redundant reference to nearly every main point.  This book could easily have been one third the length and twice as effective if the author had been concise 
    Another anxiety-driven media clown with nothing remotely clever to say.  Save your money. 
 I too really enjoyed the first two books in this series and was saving this installment as one I was sure to love. But I had to skim the last 100 or so pages because I knew how it was going to turn out and the dialog wasn't fun or enjoyable to me. It may be true that Randall and Emma are true to life, but they're just not people I wanted to spend anymore time with. It's too often that teasing is confused with bulling and I think that Randal in particular was abusive and domineering towards the end, with the excuse of he's the cop so it's Ok.  Authority figures are tough to portray well, but authors can write characters as roll models. When there are those ideal authority figures, children can be children and that's very dimensional and rich. For Randal to be the love interest and not be nice to Molly is just un-excusable. And for Emma to be un-parented and friend to Molly is un-healthy 
 SD110 NOT A GOOD DIGITAL CAMERA. BETTER YET FIND SOMETHING ELSE. I'VE HAD THIS CAMERA ALMOST A YEAR BUT I JUST SELDOM USE IT BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THE PICTURES ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING. IT IS JUST FINE DOWNLOADING THEM ON THE INTERNET BUT WHEN YOU HAVE IT PRINTED ON THE PAPER, THE PICTURES GET BLURRED. NOW,IM LOOKING FOR ANOTHER DIGICAM THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT ME 
  This book is riddled with fallacies and very poorly organized. Although some of the ideas were interesting, it seemed like the author just made everything up! It's amazing that something like this actually got published.   I think this paragraph about the author's "trip" to one of the astral planes speaks for itself.   "Suddenly the figure of the evil Darth Vader came out of the woods... My astral sense of humor was in attendance, as I created a can of spinach, opened it with miniature lightning bolts, and consumed this can of power immediately.   Just like Popeye, my fists grew in size, and I punched Darth Vader right through his helmet..."  How stupid does the author really think we are? This obviously reflects his opinion of the readers of his book.   If you want to expand spiritually, I suggest reading something by Thich Nhat Hanh, or any author that knows what they're writing about.  
 This book was a great book. I like the way Trent was helped by Nick. One thing I didn't like was the violence. I am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. I would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. That is what I thought about Night Hoops.      Sunny Block 
 After just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read "e18".  So I was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that Canon refuses to admit.  Try Googling Canon S500 e18", and you'll see what I meant.  Don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight 
 "Justified", the multi-platinum debut album from singer / songwriter / ex-N'Sync member Justin Timberlake, justifies (pun intended) my discontent for his music and my disliking towards his superficial personality. Ok, so he does have a strong voice and a very sweet falsetto, but this album is generally nothing more than mass-marketed Teen Pop masquerading as an artistic landmark. Succumbing to lusty urges & deliberately destroying the career of one of the most influential singers in music history (Janet Jackson) for the sake of one's own viewing pleasure is bad enough, but fooling millions into believing that "Justified" is a great album when it's generally anything but, sickens me.   Alright, so there are a few gems that can be found on this disappointing debut. Lusty, candy-coated Dance-Pop gems like "Like I Love You (feat. The Clipse)" & "Rock Your Body" -the latter one which features some surprisingly nice beat-boxing skills from Justin Timberlake- are way too infectious for the typical club-goer to deny, especially when it's The Neptunes who are providing the club-ready, minimalist beats & grooves (in fact, the legendary production duo are responsible for most of the album's production). "Senorita" is a slightly upbeat, charming ode of love to the sexy ladies over some Latin-tinged production & piano keys. "Cry Me A River", by far the album's best track, is a powerful ballad where Justin's emotional vocals sound both heartbroken and mercilessly angry at the same time over Timbaland's stellar production.  Unfortunately, there's nothing else that's nearly as infectious or as emotionally convictional as the 4 aforementioned tracks (which just happened to be this album's singles). Justin carelessly croons, coos and whispers his lyrical web of cheesy metaphors and unconvincing lies to a female audience dumb enough to believe it all on the reeking-of-bulls*** ballad "Take It From Here". One of Timbaland's weakest beats are unwelcomely put to use on the lacklustre "Oh No (What You Got)", a lazy, failed attempt at flirting with an anonymous female in a club that must've been very low in energy, if not numbers. Then there's the infectious beats that are wasted when Justin's lusty desires churn out more corny come-ons on "Take Me Now" & "Right For Me". The ballads don't receive much blessing either, especially on the whiney reminiscence of "Still On My Brain" & "Last Night" (even though the latter track had a nice, bouncy beat that was put to waste).  What I hate most about this album is not the cheap filler tracks, but the fact that it's Justin Timberlake not bothering to fully make use of his oft-lacklustre resources. Whether it's his rotten relationship with Britney Spears, his former affiliation with chest Teen Pop phenomenon N'Sync and his obvious musical influence from Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake leaves no stamp of authenticity or ownership over his music, which is ultimately what lets this album down. Honestly, almost anyone can sing this ice-cold pile of trash. There's very little sense of ambition to pull much of this material very far. Only buy this if...  1.	You're too ignorant to acknowledge anything I've said 2.	You need proof that Justin Timberlake lacks enough of an identity to establish himself as a serious artist 3.	You want too annoy your friends (ESPECIALLY if those friends are fans of Hip-Hop)   Otherwise, just buy the singles & try your luck with "FutureSex/LoveSounds", his no.1 sophomore effort. 2 stars!        
 I'm an electronics student with a teacher that doesn't have a clue how to teach and seems to know little about electronics.  That means I have to rely on the textbook.  This is the 2nd book by this author that I've had to use with this teacher.  DO NOT GET THIS BOOK IF YOU'RE IN THE SAME SITUATION.  Floyd seems to think we students already know what he's talking about.  He also loves to refer to diagrams in the text then hides them elsewhere (not on the same page). I HATE THIS GUYS BOOKS!!!!!! 
 I was instantly intrigued by this book. I was disappointed that of the 242 pages, it take until page 181 for him to decide to even play Traumerei for his wife.  Quite frankly, this book is filled with self indulgant nonsense. If Adams had stuck to the idea of writing a book about just learning piano , it would have been fine. Instead he meanders onto subjects such buying boats and taking trips. What does any of that crap have to do with playing piano?  I think Noah Adam's experience is very indicative of the "I want everything now with little work" philosophy that pervades our country. I have very little doubt that the exquisite Steinway he bought has either been sold or is gathering dust. What a shame.  
 This seems at first like a solid, academic, study. There's some interesting material on corruption in Mexico and Columbia, and on government use of drugs dating back to the Opium Wars. But by the time you get to chapter 10, on "Cultural Underpinnings of Modern Drug Consumption," it's hard not to realize that in fact the book puts forward a ... conspiracy theory: Freemasons, George Soros, Paul Allen, Satanic rock musicians, Playboy magazine, Aldous Huxley, George Soros again... -- they've all supposedly been involved in a vast conspiracy to promote drug use to undermine the state. .. 
 This text does not attempt to show that Darwinism is false, at best it succeeds in showing that certain applications of the theory are incorrect.   Evolution is not a "religion for adults" - it is a complex theory that should not be debated by those who do not know it. Simply because there exist statements about the theory (or statements made by the proponents of the theory) that are perhaps false, does not mean the entire theory is.  Has anyone heard of Richard Dawkins? He clearly showed how evolution can and has created cooperative systems.   Everyone - please educate yourselves from a well-balanced mix of texts, understand what the author's points are, and more importantly, reason about what is said - there are authors that care more for the money made from publishing a book, than the honest science and research that should go into it 
 Of all the reasons to be interested in pi, surely curing your father's belly ache is the least inspired. This book is about politics not mathematics 
 If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot.  As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least.  I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day.  If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book "Improper English", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series 
 This book is very lacking in many types of shade plants that I have used for my very shady property.  (ie. Caladium, Houttuynia and Polemonium to name a few.  Ferns and Ivy are not even listed in the index!!!)  This book is difficult to use.  The photos and descriptions of the plants exist in separate sections of the book with no reference to one another. On a positive note, the photos do include a name below them and are in alphabetical order. Overall, a great disappointment 
 A real eye-opener: with all sincerity, I cannot believe Simon and Schuster has published this under the aegis of "Simon and Schuster Children Publishing." The language is execrable, the text jammed with f--- and sh-- and d---. In the early pages the seventeen-year-old protagonist walks in on her boyfriend's amorous dealings with the girl's own mother. And after she hooks up with street youth we are treated to a thorough detailing of  the materials and the methods of intravenous drug use (only this girl isn't really sure exactly what she's cheerily pumping into her veins), dumpster diving, vandalism, breaking and entering, theft, the tale of a man trying to blind a boy by crushing his eyeball with his thumb, scavenging leftovers from deserted restaurant tables and other like diversions. According to the publisher's website, Ms. Black is a favorite among kids. What I hate most is that these demeaning elements in the story are gratuitous: without them, the book might just be a worthwhile read because of its ingenious world of trolls, tree women, and "faeries." I can see how teenagers would agree that the "world would be cooler with something so unreal in it." As it is, I cannot imagine recommending it to a teen--or anyone else-- to read 
 I haven't studied math in many years, and I wanted to freshen up my skills. I was never a math wiz, but I'm certainly competent at the basics. When you get beyond the basics, my brain starts hurting a bit though. Unfortunately, this book is so poorly written that even the basics made my brain hurt.  First off, contrary to what the title and cover suggest, this book contains almost no information on the basics. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are all covered in less then a page and a half. But don't get your hopes up... He doesn't actually tell you how to DO multiplication (for example). He tells you that multiplication is represented by a "x". The actual process of doing multiplication is apparently left as an excercise for the reader.   Ok, no problem. Like I said, I'm pretty good on the basics, I wanted something a bit more advanced anyway. Unfortunately, what information is here is presented so badly that you pretty much need to be a mathmetician to read it (in which case you probably don't need this book). Take the section on primes from p. 12: "Let p be a nonzero natural number. Suppose ab = p, where a and b are natural numbers. Further suppose that either of the following statements are true for all a and b: (a = 1) & (b = p) or (a = p) & (b = 1). Then p is considered a prime number. In other words, a natural number p is prime if and only if it's two natural number factors are 1 and itself". That's demystifying? Primes are a pretty simple topic, but you'd never guess it from that definition. I have since picked up a different book "Math the Easy Way" (by Anthony Prindle) which has this to say on the subject: "A prime number is a whole number whose only divisors are 1 and itself". Not only is this definiton MUCH more clear, it's less then a quarter the length. If the goal is to demystify a subject, you should use the least complicated language possible to effectively explain the subject, and this book fails miserably on that front.  This may be a great book if you are already well versed in moderately advanced math. If you're looking for a more basic math refresher, this will not do you any good at all. I havn't read much of Math the Easy Way yet, but so far it's been head & shoulders above this at demystifing everday math for me 
 There isn't anything new here unless you want to fall asleep reading about cheese and whisky.  Dr. Weil gives examples of how some cheese's and whisky get better as they age as if this is supposed to correlate to people.  I love Dr. Weil's other books and his website but I was disappointed by this book.  If you want to read a good anti-aging book read Roy Walford's 120 year Diet.  An excellent read.  
 Just one of the many lies i n this book overlooked (????) by Douglas Brinkley was Kerry supposedly in Cambodia in 1968 and  havinga telephone conversation with Pres. Nixon. HINT: Johnson was the president in 1968, not Nixon.  To read this book 'TOUR OF DUTY', you'd swaer that Kerry was a real life Rambo when in fact, Kerry was more concerned with carrying around 8mm cameras and old fashioned and heavy Smith-Corona typewritters layingt he foundation for his future presidential campaign.  In another regard, what happened to that BIG DRAFT KERRY said was goingt o happen in January 2005? And the reduced social security benefits? And the Herbert Hoover economy? These were just some of the lies that Kerry repeated over and over and over during his failed presidential campaign in 2004.   But what really happened? There was no draft and 2005 is nearly over. Our seniors got a raise, not a cut in social security benefits and all economic factors show that the economy is doing just great thank you.  Are you all glad that Kerry got whipped last year? Say yes.  [... 
 I found this book physically difficult to use. It was a chubby small paged paperback as opposed to earlier editions of the same whose pages were much larger, and the books easier to use. Also, it was not as topical as I had expected...i.e. upgrades of state descriptions adding state mottos...addition of Roman numerals...addition of more common current slang...etc. I was NOT happy with my purchase. I feel the authors could have done a much better job 
 This is in response to reviewer Natasha Lofft's claims that she is the half-sister of Natalie Wood in the review of Gavin Lambert's "Natalie Wood: A Life," dated on May 23, 2005.    Natasha Lofft is the daughter of Maria Gurdin's first love, Captain George Zapalov and his wife Nina.  This story originated from a fantasy that Maria Gurdin, Natalie Wood's mother, harbored for years because Captain Zapalov was her first love.  Maria Gurdin first met Natasha Lofft while vacationing on the Russian River when Ms. Lofft was a teenager.  Maria Gurdin, it must be noted, was a woman who suffered mental illness and Alzheimer's for many years before she passed away.  George Zapalov had blue eyes and Maria Gurdin had green eyes.  The two of them together could not have had a brown eyed child.  Also, Nina, Natasha Lofft's real mother, had brown eyes.  How could Maria have given birth to two kids around the same time?  If Natasha Lofft wants to prove that she is truly Natalie Wood's half-sister, she should pay for a DNA test and stop wasting people's time with this fantasy 
 What were they thinking?  Pearl Harbor is nothing more than an attempt to remake Titanic with Japanese Zeroes instead of an iceberg.  While not quite "Postman" bad, Pearl Harbor's awful acting, terrible dialog, and overall uninspired dross toward a delicate historical event marks this film as one for the bargain bin next to "Showgirls. 
 Back in 2003 T2 extreme was released which was an excellent version of the movie.  Not only did it have excellent extra features, but it had the extended version which is wonderful, and a 1080p version of the original theatrical version (i.e. this one being reviewed) playable via home computer.  Now, at the time the requirements were quite steep in order to view the movie, but to todays computer standards it is minimal.    I watched the blu ray version at a friends house, brought over my T2 Extreme edition, played it on his computer next to the HDTV, and compared the two.  There was hardly any difference and if there was the hat went off to the computer version.    Why do I mention this?  Because this blu ray is over priced and has nothing for extras.  You want the best version of T2 you can buy?  Then walk yourself down to a local wal-mart and go to the $7.00 DVD rack and pick up Terminator 2: Extreme Edition.  You'll want to shoot yourself if you don't do it.  HECK, BY 4 OF THEM FOR THE SAME PRICE AS ONE BLU RAY VERSION!  There's your Christmas presents!! 
 This book is heavily oriented towards Christians and a Biblical motivation for marriage.  I picked this up after reading Chapman's "Five Love Languages," which was inspired by his faith but grounded in observation and study of real people.  "Hope for the Separated" does offer good advice on how to approach living apart, what to do with the time, how to approach reconcilliation, etc.  Unfortunately, the only motivation given for reconcilliation, as opposed to divorce, is that the Bible says so. While this is enough for many, the approach of "Five Love Languages" led me to expect something more widely applicable.  In sum, this book provides much of the "How" but not a whole lot of "Why," unless a Biblical explaination is all the "Why" that you need 
 I definitely would not say this is the best written book I have ever read; far from it.  I think he lingered too long on his abusive childhood and his sexual prowess and less on his struggle from being homeless to becoming successful.  I understood his desire to be with his son, but knowing you didn't have a decent paying job and appropriate living arrangements, why would you put your child in that situation?  Maybe if more explanation was given, it would have made more sense to me.  I commend Chris Gardner, I just didn't like the book 
 Although Roizen and Oz have a great premise here for loosing weight what they have to present gets lost in the presentation.  The book is full of idiotic quips that are redundant, serve no purpose to the book, are a distraction to the overall message of the book and at times were rather degrading.  While the quips are at first funny, 30 pages into the book it gets to be rather tiredsome.  And the diagrams and cartoons in the book didn't add to it at all.  The diagrams belonged more in an elementary school science book than in a book whose target audience is suppose to be adults.  The cartoons, like the quips, just got tiresome.  I was inspired to go out and buy this book after seeing the YOU ON A DIET show on TV.  I honestly thought the docs had something useful here.  Unfortunately I was only able to make it half way through this book before having my "fill" of it.  As the diet was in the last part of the book I didn't quite make it that far and at this point I just don't have the stomach to open this book again.    As I mentioned before I do believe that Roizen and Oz have a good premise here however I just found this book to be too full of silly foolishness to be taken seriously as a diet book.  I am glad to see that it has worked for others, I just wish these two had presented their material better as I was totally ready to give their ideas a SERIOUS try - unfortunately I just don't think they were serious enough about their ideas for me to try them.  I don't recommend this book to any serious dieter.  If you want serious motivation, a common sense plan and someone who will talk to you like the adult you are then I suggest any of Bob Green's books - a very enjoyable read from which I gained enough motivation to lose 50 pounds!!  Having reached a plateau that I am having a difficult time breaking I thought something new and different might be worth a shot.  You On A Diet was definitely not new or different, it was boring and degrading 
 Just having read Julia Child's "My Life In France";Anthony Bourdain's "The Nasty Bits;, and, Bill Buford's "Heat" (all beautifully and wryly written); I found Ms. Greene's memoir sleazy and extremely self-absorbed.  Ms. Greene was living in a halcyon period of evolution in the history of cooking in America; but alas, she was more engaged in her own glorification.  Way too much self-promotion and not much real information on the wonderful awakening of Americal's taste buds and techniques in the kitchen 
 I had the clever idea to compare this version with the new movie.  What a mistake.  The original pink panther is an absolute bore.  There is really no story. Essentially, Peter Sellers spends much of the movie trying to get his wife in bed.  Major parts of the story make no sense.  Don't waste your time 
 This book is an excellent affirmation of Christian values that must be read by anyone who didn't realize that "The Da Vinci Code" was a work of fiction. Please reread that sentence; "The Da Vinci Code" is a work of fiction, like "Star Trek" or "Harry Potter". Unfortunately, the same people who fail to appreciate this fact are the same people who actually need to read "Cracking Da Vinci's Code," in order to restore balance to a worldview so easily upset by Dan Brown's clever yarn.   Unfortunately, this book is poor ammunition for anyone actually hopeing to defend the Christian faith from a popular fascination with the romanticized Cult of the Magdelene presented by Dan Brown. Doctors Garlow and Jones, both highly educated evangelists, have crafted a book that is more or less comfort food for their audience, not any scholarly attempt to address the factual underpinnings of Brown's novel. Somewhat pointedly, Garlow and Jones choose some of the weaker elements of Brown's novel to base their case on.  For instance, by way of dealing with non-Canon gospels (the Gnostic gospels, and the somewhat-less-offensive Apocryphal texts), Garlow and Jones give a selective history of the Council of Nicea which posits that they merely reaffirmed a version of the New Testament already in circulation. This is somewhat true, but ignores how the wording of the gospels were decided to specifically reaffirm the Nicean view of Christianity at the expense of other popular Churches of the time (including churches established by the very disciples of Jesus). They cast aspersions on non-Canon texts without actually addressing why they are or aren't considered reliable. Likewise, when it comes to a discussion of Paganism and its influence on Christian theology, the authors steadfastly refuse to acknowledge even the possiblity (much less the accepted fact) that rituals central to Christianity - such as baptism, the eucharist, and  chrism (annointing with oil or ashe) - were all employed by pagan cults for thousands of years prior to Christianity. Instead, Garlow and Jones rely on the emotional impact of the epithet "pagan" on their reader to cast aspersions and reinforcce doubt.   Most disappointing about this book is that the authors attack fiction with fiction. Where there exist stronger points in the scholarship that underpin Brown's fiction (and I can't emphasize enough that "The Da Vinci Code" is JUST an entertaining story), Garlow and Jones turn instead to a fictional couples experience attending a discussion group of Brown's book and it's central thesis, which naturally involve secularist ridicule of faithful Christians engaged in acts of ministry.   There are even a few instances where the authors manufacture assertions by inferral that were never made by Brown or any of his characters. Half way through this book, I got the distinct impression that neither Garlow or Jones (nor their editor) ever actually read Browns fictional works.  This is one of those rare books where I was relieved to finally have finished it. There is no vice in the spirited defense of ones faith through the presentation of facts in support of rational argument. Unfortunately, this book is very light on facts, and frequently resorts to emotional arguments. The Gospels tell us that Jesus himself debated with authority found in a thorough knowledge of the law, and was skilled in avoiding rhetorical traps. Garlow and Jones do the opposite: they count on the unfamiliarity and uncertainty of the general population, and frequently employ rhetorical traps. Anyone seeking to be Christ-like, and defend their faith, would do well to not rely on this book. 
 Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us 
 It's simply not the best of Sting '84-'94.  The version of We'll Be Together (a great song) is an alternate take (mix?), VASTLY inferior to the album / radio version.  It's anemic.  Lacks the punch.  In a word -- sucks.  That you're not told this on the cover is misleading.  I really enjoy Mr. Sumner's music.  All the other tunes are as they should be, and they are terrific.  4-5 stars.  But don't buy this product if you expect to hear what you've heard on the album or the radio 
 Was not the same boot from the pictures. Got very sad when opend my packet 
 This book was a chore to read, too slow, too cluttered and the love interests weren't even interested in each other much less showing any personality.  The people never came out of the book they were flat and pathetic.  I am an avid reader, and enjoy books that include the supernatural.  It is pretty hard to make a vampire as dull and numbing as this one was.  If you are interested in something interesting with a twist of the supernatural I would recommend that to read Laurell K. Hamilton or Christine Feehan over this particular author 
 For those people who didn't make it through the book, here is a (perhaps oversimplified) summary.  Assumption 1 : Machines function algorithmically. The human brain functions at least partly non-algorithmically   Assumption 2 : There are some mathematical problems that can not be solved by algorithms f.i. proving the correctness of a self-referring statement.   Conclusion from 1 and 2 : Humans are able to solve problems that machines will never be able to solve.  Assumption 3 : Intelligence means being able to solve every possible problem.  Conclusion : Humans are intelligent, machines will never be intelligent.  My thoughts on this :  assumption 1 : Non-algorithmically ? There is not a shred of evidence of non-algorithmic thinking in humans. There are on the other hand plenty of mechanisms taking place in the brain that are clearly algorithmic (like vision, pattern recognition etc.)  assumption 2 :  Apparently Penrose believes that humans are able to solve these problems. I am not so sure. I challenge you to answer the next question correctly : Will you answer "no" to this question ? It cannot be answered correctly. It is in the nature of the problem itself. The problems Penrose mentions are of the same nature.  assumption 3 : We don't know the nature of consciousness. We have no understanding of what intelligence implies. Penrose believes it implies that an intelligent creature is able to solve EVERY problem. Therefore, if there is one problem a machine can not solve, the machine is not intelligent. So the only thing Penrose has to do to prove his point is ask a question that has no correct answers : ask the machine to overcome the incompleteness theorem of G?del, or to answer the above question correctly. (and ignore the fact that people cannot answer it correctly either).  I have enjoyed the book in a way ... while seeking arguments to demolish Penrose's theory. 
 I had a very frustrating experience two times I tried to buy this book...each time I recieved book that had no illustrations or plates or diagrams that were listed in the contents...I had books with 174 pages when the book is supposed to have 300 pages...I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS ABOUT BUT I FINALLY CALLED BORDERS AND THEY HAVE THE BOOK WITH 300 PAGES WHICH I bought WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF 
 JEWEL IS ON CRACK.  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!?   "Women who suck their cigarettes as though they were giving their hatred head"  WHAT....? 
 This book promotes stereotypes by radically overstating some slight differences between the sexes. If you want a scientific explanation of how they are grossly misrepresenting science, read either:  1) Brain Gender   by Melissa Hines (2004)  or 2) The esssential difference: the truth about the male and female brain   by Simon Baron-Cohen (2003) 
 Come on people, let's get real.  How many scientific articles (well controlled studies) were used in this book.  The answer is none!  The segment of the population with cancer, cystic fibrosis, MS etc is completely equal when controlling for the variable of "mercury" silver amalgams.  So using this idiot's logic, silver fillings should also be said to prevent disease.  It is sad to see a man using poor science to get peoples hopes up, just to make some money 
 The Christian life should be one of honesty with ourselves, with our communities and with the world. All too often it isn't, and Steven James' target is a good one. Sadly this book is both overwritten and repetitive, and remarkably self-involved. Difficult to recommend 
 What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published! 
 She has one of the most beautiful voices, and is one of my all-time favorite female singers.  This album is terrible though.  Unlike Agnetha Faltskog, K.D. Lang, and Alison Moyet, who (in my humble opinion)succeeded recently with their "cover" albums (made-up of some of their favorite songs from the past), Olivia does not succeed in the choice of songs, production, and style of singing these 
 The combination of sex and violence presented here isn't anything new, and it fails to shock or disturb, clearly its intention. This is basically supermarket horror, made to be picked up off the rack on impulse. Just like an impromptu Twinkie purchase, this is easy to devour, but hardly satisfying, and certainly not good for you.  In the edition I have, as well, the text sports one glaring error per chapter, something that certainly draws you out of the already wafer-thin plot. The responsibility for this sloppiness falls on the editor, to be sure, but it doesn't help matters any.  If you're dying for a quick gore fix... still pass on this one 
 If Bell left out any cliches I would be surprised. From terrible dialog, laughable stereotyping of characters, ridiculous plot with an unlikely (to say the least) coincidence, to one of the most (unintentionally) comic finales this book has it all.    
 For starters I love Bun B and Pimp C and UGK and all that but the thing that kills it is Lil Jon yelling "gansta grizzel" like 10 times in every track. I love lil Jon too, but they coulda done without it. also they just rappin over other peps beats, it just sounds like a mixed tape kinda deal. but heard rumor that bun b is bout to come out with an offical bun b record, not a mixed tape, or nothin like that, but only reason why i gave it two stars is just cuz they got tight flows on the tracks, but not their own beats, and lil jon coulda just shut the hell up on those tracks. just keepin it real. i wouldnt spend the money, id just wait for bun b to release his own offical cd, or till pimp c get out and ugk hooks it back up 
 I did not like this book and did not enjoy reading it.  I am serious about learning how to write better and I did not find this book helpful to me.  
 I loved this series a child, but it sure is lame now. We only made it through the first couple of episode 
 Giddens doesn't provide new arguments to the globalization theme.  The arguments he does present are underdeveloped and could use much more solid backing up.  I found myself confused many times by his circular arguments.  The book ends awkwardly, the writing is choppy, and his stance is vague 
 I was disapointed in the performance of this poduct.  It absolutely did not provide 100% lift.  About 75-80%.  Also the seat is small for one that is built for up to 300 lbs. Lets face it, if your near the 250lbs and up, your bottom is much larger than the seat resulting in, hanging over the edges. It was very uncomfortable for any extended period of time.  The seat is hard and not padded well. Also, the "recliner" type chairs it says it will work on, is not totally true.  The levers that opperate the seat are on either side, but if you sit on the lift in a recliner chair the "sinking factor" hinders the use of the leavers, and makes it difficult to reach them.  We found it very frustrating and were extremely disapointed!   This was not worth the $ in our oppinion. It would be a huge improvement to widen the seat, add more padding and have a corded seperate  remote instead of  the leavers on the seat itself  
 I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.   It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.   Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader.  
 "In My Country" is undermined straight from the start by its tone deaf casting. This film - based on the narrative writings of stellar South African journalist Antjie Krog - somehow gets a starring duo of a Frenchwoman and Irishman playing Afrikaaners and an American (Samuel L. Jackson) ludicrousy grafted on top of the screenplay for the sake of starpower and a wacky, contrived melodrama that never existed in Krog's tale.  This is most unfortunate because Krog's stories - her take on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - is one that should be heard far and wide.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers bury that behind this odd and inexplicable need to feature a quasi-adulterous liaison between Binoche and Jackson's characters.  How did it turn out?  Take a look at the DVD extras:  Samuel L. Jackson is nowhere to be found.  This is a man who knows quality and knows junk.  He must taken a look at the final product and ran from this thing as fast as he could.    Good move. Smart guy 
 I found this book to be lacking.  In character development, plot, etc.  It just never really went anywhere - not that it needed to but it just didn't grab me as her other novels have.  I found it to be very underdeveloped.  Perhaps, as one other reviewer wrote, this was before she hit her stride?  That's what I think 
 I've read both Darwin's Radio and its successor, Darwin's Children. The real star of the show here is the evolutionary change itself. Bear's 2D characters drag both books down. Unfortunate, because this would make for a great SF read if the characters weren't so single-minded & cardboardlike. 
 I would like to delete about half of the truly unfamiliar tracks and possibly add a couple of better known more familiar works 
 I can't recommend this book, which falls firmly in the category of works aimed at milking the purses of comics-artist wannabes.  It also teeters right on the edge of the stuff that seems driven by an urge to discourage potential competition from entering the field.  Plus it doesn't have any valuable info on penciling!!!  Mitch Byrd's "Notes to Draw From" is a better resource.  Klaus Janson has worked on some major DC titles and apparently also teaches at the School of Visual Arts.  Here he seems to be trying to pad out grudgingly little info on penciling with a sort of "why comics require super skills to draw" pedagogy that consumes more than 110 pages of an essentially 142-page book!  There's some good info in here I suppose, but the technical stuff always needs to be taken with a large block of salt.  No one ever became a great artist by studying art.  People become great artists by doing what they enjoy!  The way to become an artist is by creating art.  As you encounter challenges you look for solutions to problems and develop.  In that sense this book might be useful.  B-S- statements like "Drawing... requires study" etc etc do more harm than good IMHO.  The most important thing for would-be comics artists to remember is that the most successful guys in the field are Matt Groening and Scott Adams.  They didn't get to the top through their knowledge of anatomy!  Frank Cho is a brilliant draughtsman, but "Liberty Meadows" will never have the kind of circ "Doonesbury" had - back when Garry Trudeau was drawing little better than stick figures!  There are lots of books written from a viewpoint of encouraging young artists to learn while supporting them through their inevitable frustrations.  Look for those books before wasting your time with this 
 George G.M. Jones knows not a thing about real history. Claiming that the Great Library of Alexandria is where Aristotle took his knowledge is ludacris because the library was built by Ptolemy II. The Ptolemic line was the successor line in Egypt. Alexander, himself was crowned pharaoh by the people because they saw him as a liberator of Egypt. The priests of Egypt viewed him as the son of Zeus. These priests were of the god Ammon who were told at his oracle. The Egyptian Mysterey System was a creation of white men and is a proven hoax. The first Greek philosophers most likely had some knowledge of Babylonian and Egyptian thought they added reasoning, something none existant in Egyptian or Babylonian thought. Even saying that ancient Egyptians were all black is wrong, as the people of Egyptian constituted a mixture of races. They were black and white. They were in fact Semites, like the Jews and Arabs, people who are Caucasian. Skin color alone does not tell a man's race. An Indian from India is in reality Caucasian, making him closer to Europeans than the Japanese or Chinese. Even most the languages of India and Iran are Indo-European, while the Basque live in France and Spain but speak a language isolate. If the Greeks stole anything from anyone it was the Phoneicians and their alphabet, something that is the ancestor to the Greek, Latin, Etruscan, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets. The name Kemet was a reference to the black soil of Egypt. Today it is called Misr anyways.  
 it is a shame that the tragic story of the victims and their families is told in such a cheap, sensationalized way. instead of serious journalistic reporting, we are subjected to a story filled with conflicting information, a difficult to follow storyline, and a tedious amount of adjectives. there is no sense of factual reporting, but instead tabloid drama. this story deserves a dignity in telling that this author did not even attempt to achieve.  in all fairness, my opinion is based on reading only half of the book. i just found it unbearable, and a waste of time. i'll wait for a book written in a more professional manner 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 There are some great lyrics on Silvio,  and Ninety Miles an Hour and Rank Strangers to Me are very cool... but there is no cohesion to the album.  Feels like Dylan was trying to make a few bucks by getting popular backup musicians.  I got rid of it promptly.  Much better bet is Infidels (my favorite) or Oh Mercy 
 The Burn Journals, in my opinion, could have been written better. I mean, no one really needs to hear about someone having an erection. We want to know how he overcame his state of being and regained his dignity. That's why I gave this book a two. It was ok, but it needed more work. 
 I didn't believe the negative reviews, but I'm a believer now! And I don't mean that I believe in ET! I gave this movie one star only because there was no less-than-one-star choice. I can't decide whether this is actually intended as tongue-in-cheek, but it is chock full of bad science, sprinkled liberally with comedy. The title, however, is very accurate - "Without Warning" - I sure didn't see it coming! By the way, if you would like to purchase a copy of this thriller, I happen to have one that was watched less than once (it was just too overwhelming and I couldn't sit through it all!). Well, gotta go. Have more important things to do, like count fly specks on the wall 
 I have to admit I am thoroughly dissappointed by this book and cannot understand the positive reviews it received from several of the other readers, except that they may be academics. If you are somebody who is only interested in the theory and philosophical background of corporate partnerships, this might be the book you are looking for, but if you are, like myself, a practical doer, who is looking for hands-on insight and knowledge on this topic, you will be deeply dissappointed. Also several of the examples of "showcase" alliances, such as Iridium, are not only outdated, but in fact, bankrupt. Very annoying to read about these "great" alliances, that several months after publishing went belly up. To sum it up, for the practical business professionals among you, I suggest you keep on researching on other books in this genre. Unfortunately, since I didn't read yet any other books on this topic, I cannot offer an alternative book advice 
 The book is super-barbie-girly, both in terms of illustrations and the texts. Every single story reads silly, simplistic, dry and boring. The stories are basically the same familiar old good fairy tales, but somehow the details are altered to make them "morally correct," and, as sideeffects, become very silly girlish.  
 Good book giving the details on all the CS 2's new features. Two thumbs up 
 Let's just say you get what you pay for.  This product has perhaps the worst user interface I've ever seen.  I did manage to get it connected to my network, but found it unusable from that point.  I returned mine 
 I bought this back in October of 2006.  Can someone who bought it more recently tell me if the sound issues have been fixed?  I returned this item for a refund and won't be buying it again until Paramount fixes the sound issues.  Parts of the show are very quiet; I had to turn the sound up to even make out the dialog.  Then, a loud part comes on and almost blows my speakers.  This happens multiple times per episode.  Repeat this for six hours.  If I wanted this kind of quality, I'd just download the episodes off the Internet.  There will be a gap in my collection until this is fixed.  I don't know why they can't pay someone $5.15 an hour to watch the DVD once before they make 10 million copies 
 "The Zahir" started out well, but about 100 pages into the book my interest level dropped.  It, in no way, mentally stimulated me.  I could not read one more page of the main character's self-indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions.  I guess, if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel, then this is not your book.  I couldn't stand him and I really hope that the main character isn't a reflection Paul Coelho.  I almost threw this book away, but I instead donated it.  I loved "The Alchemist." 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 I have been studying astrology for twenty years and practicing it for a few.  I bought this book based on the glowing recommendations here on Amazon.  I wish I had not.  The premise of the book is sound.  It is that, unless something is promised in the natal chart, then it will not manifest in the life of a client.  But the author almost immediately contradicts herself.  On page 42 she says: "We are not stuck with the natal promise of our chart.  There is always the potential to outgrow the more difficult aspects."  WHAT?  Does the natal promise matter or does it not?  Please make up your mind!  From there it just gets worse and worse.  The chapter called "The Natal Promise" is laughable and exemplary of the rest of this book.  The author reduces everything to childish, ridiculous generalizations.  For example, the entire section on "Success" is about the Nodes.  Apparently, at least if you follow her advice, you have no chance of success unless your North Node is in an angular house (1, 4, 7 or 10).  In the section "Violence/Rape," all she discusses are hard aspects between the Moon and Pluto.  Try telling my friend who was savagely raped and beaten that she must have imagined it happening to her since she has no aspect in her chart between the Moon and Pluto.    Not only is this book shoddily written and edited, as another reviewer mentioned, but there are some GLARING errors.  In the section on "Vocation," page 68, she claims that "Jackie Kennedy had her tenth-house Neptune in Scorpio, and she was a book editor."  Well, Neptune did not even enter Scorpio until 1956 so unless Jackie O. was about seven years old when JFK was shot, then this is completely impossible.  Finally, a large bulk of this book, maybe a third of it, is devoted to childish, cookbook interpretations which are vastly oversimplified.  But my biggest complaint comes with the author's system of making predictions itself.  It ultimately relies on eclipses, progressed house cusps and the position of the progressed Moon in order to pinpoint dates and times of events.  This, in my experience as an astrologer, simply doesn't work.  And as someone else noted, she makes no mention of Solar Arc Directions whatsoever.  The author's rambling narrative and anecdotes occasionally bring up an interesting observation here and there.  But based on all of her other glaring errors and omissions, it makes one wonder if her observations are even worth considering.  Ironically, she even promotes in the introduction to the book that astrologers develop a "personal method" in making predictions (in other words, she is suggesting that you may not want to use her method).  Honestly, I'm amazed that her method has worked for her, but if you are expecting it to work for you, then you are likely in for a big surprise.     This book was a huge waste of my time and I wish that I had not purchased it 
 I got this book from the library based on the author's name and the recommendation of her writing from some friends who had read "My Sister's Keeper" and some of her other books.  I eagerly read the first 30 pages, then quickly became bored and even started disliking the characters.  A good writer is supposed to give you enough details about the characters to make you feel as though you know them.  I am halfway into this book and not only do I not feel like I know any of the characters, I don't want to.  They are tired stereotypes who are lacking in depth and personality.  You wonder why Eric and Fitz are so in love with this woman who is totally unlikable.  The character of Fitz is so much like every other "male best friend" you've ever seen on a TV sitcom.  The stereotypical descriptions of the "fringe" characters are so boring.  Of course the prosecuting attorney is an overweight Jewish shrew.  (aren't they all?)  Of course the character of Ruthann is a "tough old" Native American who rarely shows emotion.  Of course the carousel operator is an "acne-scarred" teenager.  I just feel that these negative descriptions and characterizations are purposely written that way to somehow make you feel that the main characters are "better" than everyone else.  Poor little victims, even.  The descriptions of Eric's alcoholic mother were just like any other suburban alcoholic woman ever contrived.  I can't even muster any emotion for Sophie.  Fitz and Eric remind me of two overgrown frat boys and Delia (Bethany) is so self-centered, you almost don't care about her at all.  I hope to be able to finish this book, so at least I haven't wasted my time reading the first half 
 This book took me all of 30 minutes to read. I can't believe that the list price is $17, because it's not worth it. Just borrow it from the library, like I did. I will admit that the book has some good photographs to give you ideas for makeup looks, but that's about all it has to offer. The tips aren't anything special, and will probably only be helpful to somebody who has never worn makeup before. And on just about every other page, the author is gushing about a certain color of product, saying, "This works great with all skin tones." I'm sorry, but not every color looks great on every skin tone. The author also seems slightly biased toward warm makeup tones, rather than cool. There are several references to "warming up" someone's coloring, and many of the makeup looks lean heavily toward peach and gold tones. There was also a ridiculous section on glitter in makeup where they tell you to mix actual glitter in with your regular eyeshadow. Are they kidding? This is a good way to get glitter in your eyeball. Why not just buy an eyeshadow that's already sparkly? There's no shortage of those 
 As per usual, any woman who entertains an independent thought---one not handed down to her by the male establishment---is immediately suspect. It's not women who are making the world worse---it's the idiots currently in charge of the government, starting with the president and vice-president and continuing through Rove and DeLay and a herd of congressmen. I'm sorry that the conservatives think women should stay home and raise families and not poke their heads out of the kitchen or nursery. I'm sorry they believe gutsy women are the cause of all the ills in the universe. I feel sorry for them that they'll never experience the satisfaction that comes from being their own person, beholden to no one, because they have a paying job and a degree of independence. When the world comes to value "women's work" and makes raising kids, cleaning house and fixing meals a well-paid endeavor, I might think that women would be better off in the home. Until then, I'm not buying it. Viva to those Women Who Make The World Worse! To those who would turn back the hands of time to the 1800s when women were chattel, Raspberries by the score.   People like Kate O'Beirne scare me no end 
 I have lived in and travelled to Cuba several times over the past 45 years.  The author presents descriptions of Cuba: collapsing buildings, cockroaches, hunger, the young wishing to flee, her lover's father imprisioned and yet, never once does she ask or wonder why people are so poor and desperate.  How the author can be so oblivious to the suffering all around her and its causes (lack of human rights, due process, freedom of the press, freedom to associate, freedom to think) is sad, even pathetic.  So you have to wonder how Alfredo, the author's boyfriend, could love her unless he is a necrophiliac.  She must be dead from the neck up.   In the book, she menations an American who is looking for weed.  The American tells her that she acts normally how he acts when he is stoned.  How fitting.  I couldn't bear reading past the first 100 pages.  The crime is that trees were cut down to print this drivel.   
 "Yeast free" not, "nut free" not, "soy free" not, allergen free like the book claims -NOT.  There are allergens throughout the entire book!  There were only a couple I could use out of the 350 recipes 
 I bought this book for my CCNP recertification.  I ran into a bunch of stuff on the exam that was not covered in this book or was in greater detail than was covered by this book. I used Sybex books before on my original CCNP certification and I passed.  If I try to recertify, it won't be with one of those books.  I'll use Cisco Press.  Live and learn. 
 My daily commute is +/-3 hours, so I listen to many audio books. I love biographies and I was looking forward to this one after hearing "1776," but I could not stand to listen to this book.    The pace is painfully slow.  The 13 CDs easily could have been condensed to 10 by a reader with a better pace.  The narrator takes audible breaths at about two hours into the CDs, his stomach starts gurgling.  (I thought there was something wrong with my car.)    I'll have to get the book to comment on its content, because I couldn't get past the terrible narration.  
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 I found this book quite unsatisfactory. The main focus is always on the Western Front (shockingly leaving out the Americans and their indispensable human and logistical support). The Eastern and Italian fronts are almost completely left out. The Author seem to ignore that millions of soldiers fought and died far from the Marne and the Somne (being Italian myself, I would like to remind the Author that the Italians had 600,000 dead and millions of wounded in the Great War). The sacrifice of Russian and Italian soldiers kept hundreds of German and Austrian divisions far from the Western front and the British troops. And what about the big blounder of the Peace of Versailles? Is still too embarassing for Mr Keegan to talk about it?  
 I was excited to see this until I found out which movies would be included. Weird Science? Come on. It should have been the Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink and St. Elmo's Fire 
 I listened to this work on CD.  It took two attempts before I completed it.  I completed listening to the first CD and thought I had missed something so I re-doubled my efforts and began again.  I came away with the feeling that there were a couple of things of value but overall you will really have to dig deep to find them.  Also, if you are a Christian reader/listener you won't get past track one on the first CD.   Even after studying world religions in college and living in Asia for a year, I was left with very little to walk away with from this book.  
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 Although there is much practical advice and interesting facts about child development, the overall result is a tired and dated manual. Some of the advice is downright dangerous!  The book explored the conflict between putting infants to sleep on their back as opposed stomach. There is a  clinically accepted link between Babies sleeping on their stomach and SIDS,  Sudden Infant Death Syndrom. There isn't a pediatrition or health nurse on  the planet who would recomend putiing an infant to sleep on their belly, let  alone give an option between the two 
 No longer intended to be a comprehensive reference, the Guinness Book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that aren't even actual records ("Most Overrated Celebrity").  If you're going to do this, why not offer one edition that plays it by the book?  So dies a noble institution 
 Memoirs can be enticing and addictive. In a bookstore, I always give new ones the once-over in the hope of finding a good story. I've read many enjoyable memoirs, including "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius;" "Running with Scissors" and "Dry;" "A Child Called It," "The Lost Boy," and "A Man Called Dave;" and even `A Million Little Pieces," which, though riddled with falsehood and deceit, still managed to be well written and thought-provoking.   I picked up "Girlbomb" thinking that perhaps I had found a book of similar caliber. Regrettably, I felt that the book fell well short of not only my high expectations, but also of what could even be considered a mediocre read. Erlbaum failed to endear herself to me, not just once, but repeatedly. A large portion of her problems seemed to stem directly from her own behavior. The promiscuity, the drug-habit, the partying, all did a great deal to further complicate her already bad situation. But she either did not realize this, or did and refused to accept her share of blame. Her trial and tribulations came across as shallow and petty: the violence was less like violence and more like quarreling; the racism was less like racism and more like squabbling; the abuse was less like abuse and more like neglect.   That's not to say that she did not face difficulty and hardship, but even these parts seemed shallow and transparent. Sadly, there is little here to compel feelings of concern or even interest. Erlbaum herself seems to be indifferent, failing to communicate anything redeeming from her years spent in misery. The book comes across as resentful, bitter, and self-pitying. Erlbaum does not appear wiser because of her experience; she does not appear to have gained anything from her ordeal. The book lacks sincerity and earnestness, and winds up being tiresome, tedious, and ultimately forgettable. 
 I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded. This film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com, so be sure to rent it before you buy it. 
 Some children's shows age well and retain their charm ("Stingray" and "Thunderbirds" with their careful attention to detail, "Gumby" with its surrealism, "Davey and Goliath" with its classic moral lessons). I was looking forward to the Mickey Mouse Club on DVD as I had fond memories of watching it every afternoon after school. This has not aged well. "Spin and Marty" and "The Hardy Boys" serials are still enjoyable (they were both serialized on this program). The rest of this resembles an endless talent show put on at your local public school by some local kids. It isn't very entertaining. It gets tedious quickly. It moves very slowly.  The production numbers were expensive by children's show standards in the fifties but they look cheap and tacky by today's standards. Dull. I used my fast forward button a great deal on this one 
 I read this book, and I must say, it seems that the only thing she likes is Pantene, and other like products. On every other page there is a reference to a product, but how Pantene is better. Are you kidding me!!!! Yuck! I think she seriously got paid off on this one. Cover to cover advertisements for a damaging horrrible product 
 I bought this product from the Discovery Channel Store and I really want to love it, but all of the green colored lights stopped working a couple weeks after I bought it.  I returned to the store where I was given a new fountain, but the same exact thing happened to the new one just a couple weeks later.  The mister still works well, but the LED lights are unpredictable at best 
 This may work well, but the cuff size is not as it is in the description. It says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches. Not even close. My arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far. Sure, you can get the cuff to go around your arm, but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly, and there was just no way to even come close 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 These are great towels if you can get them.  They are very soft and a great price but I ordered them in December and they came in one at a time. Took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock.  When I ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship. Buy these only if you have a life time to get the 
 This wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it left me just feeling sad that I spent money to buy it.  The characters are predictable, the plot is predictable.. well, I should have seen it coming. However, there are a couple of funny moments.  That's why I give this movie one star 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 A MAN SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST A GANG THAT STOLE HIS MOTORCYCLE. STRAIGHT UP PREDICTABLE AND UNDENIABLY BORING. VAN DAMME LOOKS SO TERRIBLE IN THAT BEARD, I HOPE HE NEVER DOES A MOVIE WITH HIS BEARD LIKE THAT AGAIN. THE MOVIE IS STUPID, THE PLOT IS SO LAME, AND THE ACTION IS SO BORING. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW A DIE- HARD FAN OF VAN DAMME COULD LIKE THIS! THIS IS A MOVIE THAT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE IN STORES. THIS DEFINITELY AIN'T WORTH ONE CENT OF ITS PRICE. IF YOU ARE A VAN DAMME FAN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. A WALK IN THE WOODS IS MORE EXCITING THAN THIS. IF THIS MOVIE REALLY DOES APPEAL TO YOU, THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW YOUR ACTION MOVIES TOO WELL 
 If you're looking for a book to convince you or remind you that the left is evil/pathetic/wrong/or whatever look elsewhere.  Flynn does a poor job of fact finding or arguing his point.  He relies on, for example, what are apparently random people he interviewed at protests to create a blanket view of liberal beliefs.  Look at the footnotes in Chapter 4.  I'm sorry but this is like looking for a Leno's Jaywalking segment to find spokespeople for a movement.  Also in Chapter 4, Flynn lays out the 5 myths of the left.  Does the left actually believe them?  As a bleeding heart liberal who knows mostly other bleeding heart liberals I'll give my response:  1)	American Women Live Under a Patriarchy - his point is that women in America are better off than just about anywhere else.  True, but that doesn't mean they don't live under a patriarchy. 2)	America is the World's Leading Threat to the Environment - his point is that places like Russia and China are far worse.  No one I know disagrees with his point.  3)	America is a Racist Nation - His point is that we are not.  I don't know any liberals who think America is a Racist nation 4)	The United States is an Imperial Power - as this was published in 2002 I'll abstain from commenting other than to say that he says the left believes that the international growth of Starbucks, McDonalds and such is cultural imperialism.  I think many liberals would agree with that.  He says most of the countries embrace these companies opening stores in them.  I say that doesn't mean its not cultural imperialism. 5)	The Rich Get Richer, the Poor Get Poorer.  His argument is apparently that individuals who were in the lowest 20% of the income bracket in 1979 were mostly not in 1988.  He cites and article in the National Review where these numbers came from.  That article sites a Treasury Department survey.  So he's relying on secondary sources for his information?  Looks like shoddy research to me.    The book is riddled with problems.  For example, On pg. 31 he quotes Robert Altman as saying that we were in a way for Afghani oil interests.  Flynn then says that its not clear who Altman was referring to or why he would say that about a country without major oil reserves.  Here Flynn misses a perfect opportunity to attack a widely held liberal belief that Bush attacked Afghanistan for a potential pipeline that could be used to get oil out of Central Asian countries.  He doesn't though.  He lets it lie.  This is the nature of my problem with him.  Again and again his attacks are inept or simply untrue.    Reading his summary of why the Left hates America is just tripe.  No one I know thinks like this.  He says we believe capitalism is a failed economic system.  I don't know anyone who believes this.  Personally, I believe in universal healthcare but that's primarily because I've dealt with HMO's before.  He also says the Left condemn Christianity as intolerant.  Once again, no one I know believes this.  This book is full on nonsense.   
 Having seen the recent headlines regarding the conflict in the Middle East, I was looking for a book that would help me better understand the perspective of both sides and justification for each's actions.  This book fell far short of the mark, becoming quickly clear that the book was highly biased in support of Israel.  The book felt more like propaganda than literature.  I don't know the basis of the conflict.  I just want to understand both sides of the conflict, and that is why I bought and read the book.  However, the book quickly builds to an assumption that all Arab's and Arab Government entities in the Middle East are "Terrorist" in nature intent on killing Jews, but gives no explaination as to WHY they would want to kill Jews?  I am sure that both sides have some reasonable basis for their claims, but this book only tells the Jewish side of the story from a Jewish Studies Professor whose partents are Holocaust Survivors.  I was very disappointed in a book that implied objectivity, but seemed to only tell one side of the story.  
 everyone says that slipknot ripped these guys off but the fact is mushroomhead started in 93 and slipknot started in 92 i know this because i have a basement recording of theirs from 92. i am a big slipknot fan i think that mushroomhead is not nearly as good or talented as slipknot lyrically i mean in 43 sum of the dumbest lyrics ive ever heard and where can they compare with songs like wait and bleed spit it out and lets hear mushroomhead pull off a solo like in welcome or pulse of the maggots. i only did a kids review so i didnt have to register just so u kn 
 Once again I have to disagree with every other reviewer.   Greek Homosexuality is a strange book. It is also infuriating. I was never able to read an entire chapter of it. I threw it several times in the garbage can and then went out again to retrieve it because I thought I should know more about Greek gays. But the fact is that the more I read the less I understood what Greek homosexuality was. My own take is that the writing of Greek Homosexuality is an extreme case of a rampant scholarly disease called "not seeing the forest because of the trees".   If you want to buy this book because you are anxious to know whether homosexuality was widespread in ancient Greece and whether it was really accepted as a normal form of sexual behavior, let me tell you that the author has no definite answer to these two crucial questions. These are the kind of general questions he eludes or is honest enough to leave unanswered because the evidence is unconclusive. I spoke of honesty, but I sometimes put down the fuziness of all this to a wrong understanding of what it means to be objective. To be objective doesn't mean to just align dozens and dozens of pottery fragments and ancient author quotes and other scholarly references and then leave the reader to decide what this all means.   As I have just said, Greek Homosexuality is replete with hundreds of details about homosexuality in art, in law, in philosophy, in language. But the trouble is that it is almost  completely devoid of enlightening syntheses. Therefore every time I read a few pages in this book, I ended up knowing less about homosexuals in ancient Greece than when I took it up. This sounds incredible, yet it is true. I have tried to read the whole book several times, but simply wasn't able to. I keep getting lost in thickets of disconnected details while the myriad qualifications with which they are hedged about and the dry and technical language get the better of all my intellectual machettes.   Therefore my conclusion is: Greek Homosexuality is un-rea-da-ble! But I will gladly admit that the numerous black and white photographs of male nudes depicted in Greek art are gorgeous and give the reader a fleeting sense of understanding the whole mess of details in the rest of the book.   Touto biblion ouk esti kalon...   
 Such a book is naturally biased toward favor of the technique.  But readers should look up "Shettles Method" on the web and read up on more critical evaluations.  For example, "...adherence to these methods may decrease your chances of conception, without improving the odds of having a child of the gender of your choice. Note that caffeine has been linked to miscarriage, and douching has been linked to tubal damage and infertility." and "...in the New England Journal of Medicine, that has shown that 'for practical purposes, the timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation has no influence on the sex of the baby.'"  You can also find out the details of the method (such as a simple chart) before investing in the book.  
 Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.   I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.   The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
 I wanted to like this book, really, but after 70 pages or so, I realized life is too short to waste on crap like this. Where to start? The lead character speaks like someone in a Stephen King novel. For instance, who have you ever met someone in real life who introduces themself with their full name, including middle name? Now, that wouldn't be so bad if, like King, it had a good plot. But I didn't believe this one for a microsecond. The whole family watched from a window as the teen couple kissed? The girl in the lingerie store cheerfully tried on clothes for the lead character? Come on. When the protagonist showed up in the yard of his family's old house and started weeping, I made a vow to myself: If he wound up bedding the woman who came outside to chase him away, I was outta there. I'm glad I followed that vow 
 So I love Bill Bryson - and have bought many of his books and Cds - however I was dismayed to see something marked as "Audio CD" shipped out which is a weird Ipod nano sized MP3 device with the whole book on it. (appears to be a non-rewriteable MP3 device) Not that that's not a neat idea - but it demands you listen via headphones - I listen at work or while I drive and was expecting a CD - I am returning this item - and looking forward to getting a real CD.  Buyer beware!! But Bill Bryson is a great reader and storyteller 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 I bought this cd because I'm a great fan of Cox, but I was a bit disappointed when I heard it. It's the kind of easy listening that even my parents don't play anymore. Of course, there are a few tracks that I do like, but I prefer the technomusic Carl Cox plays most of the time... In my opinion, the cd isn't really one piece of music, as I am used to with mixed albums. It's just a compilation of tracks put on a cd to make money in an easy way 
 This is by far the worst book I have ever read.  It is dull, boring, and you don't even have a clue as to what is going on until about the 20th chapter (and it only has 22 chapters) 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 You'll love this. I sat in amazement and watched about one-half of this rambling mess about people who were so vulgar and pointless that I could not understand why major stars agreed to do this. When Chazz Palminteri smashes his head into Anna Paquin's forehead, I lost it.   If you enjoy watching a "movie" about people who have diarrhea of the mouth and spend their pointless lives snorting coke, screwing, bitching, complaining, snorting more coke, talking about drugs and bitches, snorting more coke and commenting about every single thing they've just said, you'll have a grand old time. If you want to be entertained, moved, enlightened or challenged, you'd be better off sitting in a lotus position and chanting your own mantra 
 In this work, Bhagwati offers valid arguments for globalization.  He is takes some of the strongest criticisms of globalization and is able to find fault in them, and at the same time, declares the benefits of a globalized economy. However, one need not read the entire book to find out Bhagwati's views.  Bhagwati's stance on globalization is almost so extreme that he instinctively and automatically comes to the defense of globalization without providing a fair analysis.  As a Harvard professor, I would assume him to provide more academic and holistic defenses and criticisms.  However, his book is an easy read and one that opens the reader to arguments for and against globalization whether s/he has previous knowledge of globalization or not 
 This is an unbelievably simpleminded book. It is supposedly written for school counselors--but seems to assume that we think at an elementary school level. Save your money--there's a lot better material on the market 
 This movie was not entertaining at all, bad script, etc 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 Depopulation misleading fears have been around for some time. Wattenberg should revisit his calculations and read some good demographic books, like "Demography and Degeneration: Eugenics and the Declining Birthrate in Twentieth-Century Britain"  by Richard A. Soloway 
 If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. There's barely a plot: the protagonist, Janie, marries three men and kills the last one because he gets rabies. The end. Janie is the ultimate antiheroin. She comes off as this oppressed little wife who takes forever to speak out against her husbands. It would have been better if Alice Walker had not "found" Zora Hurston and brought this awful book back into the public. 
 This book is so predictable and boring that I couldn't read past Vicky's first trip to America to meet Amber.  I didn't even get to the swap.  And, that was already more than halfway through the book!  I couldn't find myself liking either of the main characters at all.  Vicky over-romanticized everything so much it made you sick, and Amber was living such an exaggerated, spoiled life, it was surreal.    This book was so overwritten and dragged on horribly!  Save yourself time and read a book with some substance.  Leave this one in the store 
 The windtunnel II is a poorly constructed vacuum.  It is less than six months old and the motor for the HEPA filter had to be replaced.  It is very messy when you have to empty the tank.  Dust and dirt collect around the hepa filter and falls down when you are emptying the tank. 
 Of all the Anna Pigion books I have read, this is the worst. The charecters are shallow and stiff, the dialog stillted and meaningless, and the park is not well described and in no way seems like a place one would like to visit. This mystery seems to be a big "so what". Not nearly up to Ms Barr's best efforts 
 I've been through this book a few times now.  I admit that Pooh seems a good Taoist, if I remember my theology classes right.  I will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time.  Where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator's tone.  Mr. Hoff's contrasts between Taoist and Judeo-Christian approaches to life invariably give the air of self-satisfaction one so often finds in Western converts to Eastern religion.  It is this pall of smug (apologies to Trey Parker and Matt Stone) that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn.    I'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation, were it not for the tone 
 While I've been a big fan of Ghost In The Shell, these stories are the worst yet. (I've watched the first three episodes on Cartoon Network as the DVD is not out yet).   In "Make Up", the story is flawed in that Paz would have never been allowed to roam "free" while an exact copy cat of himself is on the lose killing people.  In "Poker Face" the "Emperial" America is such and Anti-American statement especially when the Amercian UN Forces have the American flag sewed on their uniforms backwards! This may have been an error but I doubt it.   In PAT. the tachikoma's voices are so annoying and so much information is thrown at you that it's hard to follow. Most if is a rehash on previous episodes. With their childest voices, they shouldn't be used as a main plot of the story 
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 Besides being unstable, this truck is extremely frustrating!  My son is constantly trying to put items in the truck that are too big, and then if he does manage to get a "load" in, he can't get it back out again!!  He has cried in frustration and thrown the toy across the room.  I will be buying him a Fisher Price one for his birthday that actually dumps 
 Sadly, one of the greatest rock songs of all time finds itself on one of the most boring rock albums of all time.  To add insult to injury, the notes on the CD cover proudly boast of 'a full eight months recording' time, which had been 'preceded by a year and a half of reflection and writing'.  We're talking 26 months here, surely time enough to produce a decent album.  Instead, they produced their only good song, which I'll say again, is an acknowledged classic, only hated by true Eagles fans, as most true fans hate the classics of their favourite bands.  If an unknown band had tried to get a record deal at that time on the basis of the rest of the filler, I seriously doubt they'd have been successful.  For good use of studio time see what can be done with just 30 HOURS of it on Led Zeppelin I 
 Droning vocals. Was hoping for so much more. Where is the passion? This CD is a total bore. Don't even feel I can pass it along 
 While I was reading this book I felt like I was reading  journal. Essentialy it was a journal with a little plot to beef up and pad the book. This was hard to read because it had very few exciting points. I only finished this because I had to read it for a class. 
 The sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant.  I thought it was not fresh tasting.  The picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only.  Other Marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit. I am glad that I only bought the small size since I ended up throwing this purchase in the trash 
 I took the author to long to get to the point.  She went all around in circles to get to the poin 
 I was really looking forward to movie.  My goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period.  Many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50's Westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing, these alone did not turn me off from watching.  My real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting.  Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, a stage coach is robbed, my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors.  They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers.  Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed.  As the movie plodded forward, scene after scene left me wondering, how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn't rehearse more.  I felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment.  I generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly, I think it was an embarrassment and waste of time.  Maybe it got better (that is why I gave it two stars) but I find that doubtful.  I am wondering if both Tom Berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of Script Writing 101. 
 This guy is normally very funny.  I think I laughed maybe 3 times 
 Quote from page 18:  Guar and xanthan gums - These sound just dreadful, don't they.  But they're in lots of your favorite processed foods, so how bad could they be?  --  If I had known that the author uttered the line above or relies on the use of artificial sweetners (Splenda and imitation honey), I never would've bought the book.  The whole point of using a slow cooker is to use natural food and spices/herbs/condiments to create healthy, home-cooked meals.  Not to take baby-steps away from processed foods.     I think the author is misguided.   Low carb does not mean "get rid of all the natural carbs and replace with artificial substitutes".   It means lessen their amount in proportion to the other ingredients.  If it wasn't for the over-reliance of Splenda and Guar/Xanthan, I would rate this book much higher, as the recipes sound very good.  However, my experience suggests that cornstarch offers a small amount of carbs for an ingredient already conveniently stocked in most kitchens.   Glibness suggest ignorance, and lowers my opinion of the author in spite of her best efforts elsewhere in the book.     
 This foam product by Jonathan is okay.  The reviews on his products are highly overrated.  The price doesn't bother me at all.  There are better foams for thin and limp hair 
 I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash. 
 This book provides good general information useful for starting any small business - with an emphasis on the private investigator.  However it  provides no real information or insight into the specific types of work  private investigators do, the day to day aspects of the work itself, or  tips for conducting these activities.   Nor, despite its' identification as  a 'self study guide,' does it  provide any useful references to related  subject matter which would provide this information.   Simple, quick, easy  and enjoyable reading but a poor value for the money 
 Wow, did someone slip the wrong CD into my jewelbox or what?  If you're a fan of Allison's other work, epect nothing like what you've heard before.  This is mostly a pop album, and the songs that could have been saved are ruined by the awful engineering.  The sound is way over compressed and artificial sounding.  Even Allisons voice has no drive to it.  Steve Earl is no match on the guitar for Joe McMahan who played on the Show CD/DVD.  
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 My background is development team lead/architect for that past several years and my review comes from this perspective.  I put this book down half way through not sure if it was worth finishing even as short as it is.  I finally picked it up and finished it tonight and my opinion of it didn't change.  This book contains some truisms that are ... generally true.  Beyond that there isn't much here.  No original insights and nothing eye opening.  It may be useful if you've never read anything on technical leadership before, but if you have this will be disappointing.  I bought this book hoping to learn what goes on "Behind Closed Doors", but the book's title is misleading.  There's nothing here that helps you to understand what goes through managers' minds before they surprise their development teams with the ridiculous things they sometimes come up with.  The narrative used to illustrate their advice is sophomoric.  Six years ago there may have been some companies run like this with thirty-somethings managing a bunch of twenty-something software engineers.  That isn't the way things are now, though.  Software projects need what all projects need:  leadership.  There's too little leadership in the software development industry and too much management.  This book offers nothing when it comes to leadership 
 I don't think this title can qualify as a guidebook. It feels like it was written in a big hurry. Using it we found big holes. The advice in it is dated and there were so many discrepancies we had to buy another guide mid-vacation. Then our vacation took a big turnaround for the better.       Maui is a real beautiful place for a family vacation if you know where to go. The traffic was pretty bad but there are certain tricks for getting around all that 
 "Wild at Heart" is flawed at heart. It is about the heart of man - not the heart of God.   "Have you got what it takes?" is the recurrent humanistic theme.  The author's psychological analysis of the male psyche is interesting, but its message of "validation" puts man firmly on the throne, and there is no room for that if God is to be King in His kingdom.  It espouses no Christian distinctives whatsoever even though it frequently and selectively misquotes scripture 
 but the fact is, this book is absolutely terrible. the majority of the gossip girl books - with the exception of this one and the last one - were just fun, trashy reads, and that was fine, because at least something interesting happened in each one of them. but legitimately, these past two books were completely horrible. nothing happened at all. if you want to spend your money on something worthwhile, go for the a-list - i just finished the last one, and it was actually really good, as the other books in that series have been. but don't waste your money on this book. i just hope the next gossip girl will be better. maybe if von ziegesar writes the new book herself, it won't suck as hard as this one did 
 Utter Disappointment, I wish I had never purchased this book.  However, it will cure any insomnia you may have.  Check out something else 
 I was required to read this for a college course I am taking and would never reccomend it to anyone on any level.  The main points of the story are already well known and can be summed up in a two page magazine article instead of a dry 200-some page book.  The author has a bad habbit of making the reader decipher dense sentences.  He writes repetitively, citing the same types of examples for fifteen page intervals and only gets to the meat of the subject in two paragraph summaries.  If you can skim through this book and find those summaries, you can definitely skip the reading, because you're not missing out on anything.  This is definitely not a book I'd ever read for pleasure, even if the subject is very enticing, the book is a battle between sleep and boredom 
 I have to start this review by stating that I adore Sandra Betzina.  I have seen her in person several times and she is a generous teacher full of wonderful ideas.  Her books are normally full of wonderful photographs worth the price of the book alone.  The photos in this book are not great - even one of Sandra in a most unflattering outfit.  I also found some of the techniques shown quite strange.  I was puzzled by the knock-knee alteration, which would actually make my pants look worse, not better and the full-bust alteration, which does not allow for extra length (only width).  If you are serious about learning to fit yourself, Fit For Real People by Palmer/Pletsch or Fitting Finesse by Nancy Zieman are better books 
 Does Turtledove devoutly wish the South had won the Civil War for its own sake, or is he just one of those admirers of Robert E. Lee (there were many at my alma mater, Vanderbilt) who can't bear that his hero came out on the losing side? Either way, surely Turtledove could have come up with a better vehicle for reversing the outcome of the Civil War than South African racists traveling back in time to arm the American rebels with yet-to-be-invented guns. The thugs of the 21st century have misjudged the motives of the noble South and the nobler-still Lee, but the general will accept their weapons anyway, thank you. This trick presages the wooden plotting and shallow characterizations to come. Turtledove's main non-historical character is a teacher-soldier who seems to come out of and return to nowhere, with no mention of family or background. Characterization in general has Turtledove stumped, so he turns to cliches, such as the prostitute with a heart of gold (this one masquerades as a male and dons a uniform to serve the Confederacy and service the main character). Turtledove even has a tragic mulatto woman on a postwar auction block. Blacks are few and rare in Turtledove's novel, and they are swept off the stage after the briefest of appearances, speaking only conventional phrases, and in dialect, of course. Both the rupture of the American Union and the continued births and deaths of millions of Americans in slavery (his Lee fashions a gradual emancipation in which blacks will "earn" their freedom decades into the 20th century) are treated by Turtledove as worthy of little more than a shrug. The more ambitious but nearly as wooden "alternate history" novel, Ward Moore's "Bring the Jubilee," at least was very sober about the consequences of a rebel victory. If you are going to reverse the outcome of a war so momentous in American and world history, don't do it as trivially as Turtledove has done in this book. There is potential for a great story in the fictional reversal of the outcome of our Civil War, but "The Guns of the South" is not it 
 My nine-year-old Great Dane just died, and I am devastated.  My sister sent me this book because she said that she knew the author and she thought it might help me cope with the loss of my lovely girl.  I am about halfway through this book, and it is actually making me feel worse.  The reason that it is making me feel worse is that included in this book are stories where the pet owners -- out of their sheer stupidity, ignorance, and irresponsibility -- actually caused the death of the pets that they should have been protecting.     One pet owner caused their German Shepherd to get heat stroke.  Another couple put their friendly Rottweiler to sleep because he had bitten other dogs, and they were afraid he would bite a child.  There are numerous other alternatives to euthanasia in circumstances such as those.  Even the author caused the death of her first dog by actually pulling her dog overboard into a fast-moving river and then let go of him, causing him to drown.  The author never should have jumped in the river herself let alone pull her dog in.     I just can't finish this book because I can't read any more stories where pet owners caused the death of their pets.  I am very sensitive in that regard, and I think other animal lovers are the same way.  I would never put any of my pets in harm's way like the author did.  I know accidents do happen, but many of these people could have and should have been better informed and made better decisions concerning the safety of their pets.  Many of these people set the stage for an accident by making a series of bad decisions.  This just angers me at a time when I already feel sad.  Furthermore, this book has not told me anything that I did not know already.  The author spends a great deal of time letting the reader know that it is okay to grieve over the loss of a pet.  It wouldn't have even occurred to me that it wasn't all right to grieve the loss of a pet.  You would have to be heartless not to do so.  If you are grieving the loss of a pet, seek comfort in your friends and family and find a different book to comfort you.   
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 This I by far the worst Scarpetta book in the series. What a shame that Cornwell let this amazing series of books get away from her. First of all, this book does redeem that terrible ending to the preceding work, `Black Notice' in which for the umpteenth time Scarpetta foolishly allows a serial killer into her home for an inevitable dull climax. And this book does have a very engaging premise in which Scarpetta is the victim here on trial, and her name is being sullied. But aside from that, this book is a disaster.   I hated the ending of Black Notice and was furious with Cornwell that she devastated a remarkably taught book with it. Other than that, I thought that the writing was the best she had done and was looking forwards to this new one because it seemed that Cornwell grew as an author from one book to the next. Also I felt that it was well past time that she tried to get away from the very predictable plot line that she has used in every single Scarpetta book up to this point. But for some reason, Cornwell's prose just falls apart here; it is dull and lengthy, without a shred of the suspense that I have grown to expect from this fine author. And the promising plot just collapses as she tries with all of her might to force it into the conformity and safe harbors of her past novels.   Some of what I hated most about this book are that there is no detecting here, Scarpetta just happenstances upon the end solution, its as if Cornwell became tired of writing and just hurried through the last couple of chapters to bring this book to an end. Secondly, Some of what could have made this book interesting, such as Scarpetta's supposed guilt over a murder from `Black Notice' never becomes a full-fledged possibility. Instead Cornwell skates around this alluring plot, spending half of the book building it up, but never pushing it over the edge. Thirdly, what's the point of having any extra characters such as Lucy or Marino? Marino never seems to add anything but bluster, why does Scarpetta always say he is the greatest homicide cop ever? All Marino ever does is leap to the wrong conclusions. Secondly, Lucy and her Last Precinct firm never get off the ground. Why was the Last Precinct firm even in the book? What did Lucy do to help her aunt?  The only interesting thing this book offered was two interactions. One was with the psychiatrist Anna and the other was with the ADA Berger. Both of these scenes either reminiscing over WWII or walking through some evidence were well done.   Cornwell, if you read these, break the mold. Do you have to have serial killers in every novel? Do you have to follow the same plot line?  
 I purchased these to keep on my counter and house my coffee.  I used them daily and they soon looked terrible!  The paint on the lids has worn off almost all the way around the edge, and there are chips off the enamel portion as well.  I do not recommend these for anyone who is actually going to use them 
 This video was not animated like the classic Chuck Jones features such as "The Cat In The Hat" and "The Grinch".  My daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation.  We give this video a thumbs down 
 I must admit that I have never [ and will never ] read this book. I only write this review so those who read it will know that Robert Groden is an unscrupulous person who continually lies [ I have evidence ] and misstates the truth in his writings.  My roommate visited Dallas a few months ago [ and the sixth floor museum ] and upon his return he was eager to share with me a periodical named 'JFK: The Case For Conspiracy' [ written by Groden; 46pgs/ New Frontier Publishing 2003 ]. He, knowing that I believed Oswald acted alone, quickly turned to page 40 and showed me a photogragh of what appeared to be smoke billowing above the grassy knoll. I calmed him down and tried to explain to him that it would be awfully ignorant of them conspirators to use that kind of gunpowder, when "smokeless" gunpowder was invented in the 1870's!! We didn't talk much more about it [ he is aware that I know this case ], but I decided to read the thing anyways. Not surprising, 46 pages of nonsense.  To give you a small sampling of the lies that this guys writes, here are a few paragraghs from the section devoted to the murder of Officer J. D. Tippit [ pg 14/ only one page devoted to this important aspect of the case!!! ]. Pay attention to the third paragragh, it's hilarious......  .............About forty minutes after the assassination, Dallas Police officer J. D. Tippit was shot to death in what may have been an unrelated incident several miles from the assassination scene in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.  The official investigators all came to the unsupported conclusion that Oswald had shot Officer Tippit. There is absolutely no evidence linking the two crimes, and none of the witnesses who actually witnessed the Tippit killing, indentified Lee Oswald [ a vicious canard ] as the murderer.  The physical evidence also tends to clear Oswald as the Tippit killer. Shortly after 1:00pm Oswald arrived at his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley in Oak Cliff. Departing the house " a few minutes after 1:00", Probably about 1:04 to 1:05 according to his landlady Earlene Roberts, he waited at the bus stop on the corner heading north. Tippit was shot nine tenths of a mile south of the rooming house at about 1:10 to 1:11 pm [ more like 1:15, but I won't harp on that ]. This would only allow five to seven minutes [ well, which is it: 5, 6, or 7 minutes? ] for Lee to arrive at the scene of the shooting nearly a mile away. It would take an Olympic class runner, or a co-conspirator driving him, for Oswald to get to Tenth Street and Patton Avenue in time......................  ???????? CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH "PHYSICAL EVIDENCE"?? That entire third paragragh is derived from eyewitness testimony and has nothing to do with the "physical evidence" of the Tippit murder. Moreover, there are six pieces of physical evidence that tie Oswald to the crime scene, including: Oswald's 38 caliber pistol which was on his person at the time of his arrest; four spent 38 caliber hulls found at the scene which were matched to Oswald's pistol [ballistically ], to the exclusion of every other pistol in the world!!; and Oswald's jacket [ identified by Marina Oswald and fibers found on the inside of the jacket matched the brown and orange fibers of Oswalds shirt, EXCACTLY!! ], which was found two blocks from the crime scene in a gas station parking lot on Jefferson Blvd. Further, three eyewitnesses [ Helen Markham, Jack Tatum, and Domingo Bienvidas ] saw the shooting and positively indentified Lee Oswald as the shooter. Not to mention the six eyewitnesses that identified Lee Oswald fleeing the scene with a gun!! But Mr. Groden would have you believe that the Dallas Police were running around, coming to an "unsupported conclusion". And he is one of the "leading advocates" for conspiracy [that should tell you something ].   Groden is a fraud and a grifter, and he puts his kids through school because people are too hardheaded to look at the evidence, which is overwhelming. My advice is to stay away from anything this guy is selling.   
 Not much information here that one doesn't already know.  Cheesy pictures of senarios of what I guy looks like bluffing and not bluffing.  Don't waste your money.  Take that money and go play some no limit poker, buy Harrington's books or Phil Gordon's Little Green book.  If you want the best book on POKER TELLS, hands down Caro's Book of Poker Tells is what you need.  Postscript:  I have to agree with J. Rubino.  I expect to get blasted for only giving it a 2.  In my opinion, I was being generous with a 2.  Notice the people who give 5 stars.  They always seem to give 5s on everything they read.  Its not unusual for the author to come on here and down grade a review by an unbias reader.  They know their book is being sold here. This book is sub-par.  Save your money 
 Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that's my style.  It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to. 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 If you have to choose between this book and Thin Tastes Better (by the same author), buy Thin Tastes Better. This book, while it has a few recipes, is mostly a retread of the information in the other book.    Two things were particularly annoying: 1) his insistence that you banish foods you have a problem overeating completely from your life, thereby reinforcing the belief that  the food is in control and not you; and 2) constant mentioning by brand name of "diet" foods that have ingredients and additives that are objectionable to many people looking for healthy food. It would have been better to just mention what you should look for in quality healthy diet fare.  Mentioning brand names also makes the book dated when items go out of production and are no longer available.  Borrow from the library to read, or buy used 
 I have read many, but never written a review before.  I felt compelled this time.  I recently purchased this CD and thought it a collection of the most ridiculous music ever.  There are a couple of nice tunes but what seems like it may have potential, is abruptly destroyed by some incongruent whim.   Thinking perhaps that I was being a musical snob, I asked the opinion of a friend.  She and I laughed so hard at how awful it was, so, I went for a third opinion.  The result was the same.  In fact it got worse with each listening.  We've decided that it will make a nice "booby prize" for my next party.  Avoid this like the plague.  It is musically inconsistent, non-relaxing and a complete source of irritation.  If you want your dinner guests to leave early by all means play this 
 This book is should be about Aztecs and Cortes. Thats a cultural war.. 
 My wife an I bought the book and tried the diet.  We could not last the 2 weeks on phase 1.  Neither of us can stand the taste of fish, so our limited choices were limited even more.  The first week went okay, but by the second week, we noticed that we had become quite irritable.  We did not want to see another salad, cheese stick, chicken, or lean ground beef.  It was not so much that we craved breads, pastas, and candy.  We missed fruit.  Even though it would only be a few more days to reach phase 2, we decided to ignore this book and start with a diet based on the government guidelines (the "dreaded" low-fat, high-fiber, portion control diet).  In addition, we made exercise a part of our daily routine.  Our moods improved quickly,  Weight is coming off.  We are getting stronger and more fit.  It's been about a month since we quit South Beach and we are happy with our current diet and have no desire to dump it.  One thing South Beach did teach us was the importance of snacking.  It really helps with portion control and hunger issues.  Only, we changed it from cheese and nuts to no-fat yogurt, fruit, or veggies 
 ... the following letter was sent by us to LP after using the (then) fresh off the press LP Cuba in July 2004.  We still did not hear from them.  -A.  Dear Madam/Sir:  We have been avid travelers for the most part of our lives and cumulatively have entry stamps from over 140 countries to boast.  For the past 10 years, we have primarily used Lonely Planet to aid travels around the world (see attached picture of subset of LP library).  Imagine our surprise and disappointment when we toured Cuba in June with the LP Cuba (2004 edition).  We have never been let down more by a travel guide in our entire lives.  Of course, things change ... prices go up ... schedules evolve; but never have we seen a guide so off the mark.  Here are a few reasons why LP Cuba is simply the worst guide we have ever used:  1/ Biased Politics -   Authors love for Cuba makes them overlook many negative aspects of both Cuban society and travel in Cuba.  Neither of us are Americans and we do not support the American government sanction on Cuba or Americans traveling there.  However, we fail to see the need to vilify each U.S. government action while simultaneously painting a picture of the perfect socialist State.  True, Cuba has some of the best social indicators in the Americas - but please also point out the "Dollar is King" economy, the sad "apartheid" regime, which allows clubs/bars/cafs/restaurants and even whole islands with some of the country's best beaches to be exclusive domain of just tourists.  How could the authors marvel at social indicators when you could sit at Hotel Inglaterra's patio, sip a mojito and gaze at the Cubans who cannot enter?  2/ Biased Interpretations of Dangers -   The section on Warnings, Scams, and Travel Advisory is the skimpiest we have ever seen.  Why?  Cuba still might be the safest destination to be in the Americas, but that's not saying much is it?  Both my friend and I (and an informal survey pointed to over 70% of the tourists) were subject to daring robberies by some very skilled "jintero's" (our advice: please do NOT give rides to anyone - other than old people or women with small children - especially if crossing the circumference of metro Havana going from A1 to A4 highway).  We never thought it would happen to two skilled travelers - but it did.  As our informal survey indicates, our later conversation with many travelers indicated many who had been robbed, mugged, conned, etc. during their travels and almost all agreed to have let their guards down due to the lax coverage of security by the authors.  In future editions of LP Cuba, PLEASE do not call "jintero's" as charming Cubans who need to be told off and do not write that the best solution is to become friends with one!  Perhaps the author's personal experience(s) with a "jintero" clouded their ability to make rational judgements?  "Jintero's" are EXTREMELY dangerous!  Furthermore, the authors fails to point out the many tourist traps in most of the tourist towns - especially in Trinidad.  3/ Biased Interpretation of Bureaucracy -   Why is their no comprehensive section which deals with the level of bureaucracy and corruption that each tourist must face while vacationing in Cuba?  In our experience, we were stunned at the need to pay bribes at the airport, at the car rental place (our advice: please plan from before and avoid the Transtur car rental agency in Copacabana Hotel near Miramar or going through Canadian agent A. Nash Travel Inc. in Ontario).  After our robbery, we spent many hours in a police station trying to get a report done but it seemed that no one was willing to help.  After having spoken to more than 10 officers over the period of 2 days, our report miraculously appeared when a $10 bill was slipped between our passports.  I mean, don't get us wrong - from extensive traveling and by the virtue of one of the letter writers being from India, we KNOW bureaucracy and corruption - but Cuba took the game to a whole new level.  Again for some reason, the authors were completely off the mark.  4/ General Info, Maps, Prices, Numbers, Layouts -   Prices go up; inflation is a part of daily lives.  But how do you explain almost 200% price hikes between what's printed and the reality?  These numbers are especially depressing given a/ this edition was hot off the press b/ the official inflation was running below 5-10% band c/ we traveled in low season and the prices listed were for high season.  Our hunch that the authors never actually checked the prices and conduct the required background work was confirmed as we asked all the places we stayed at and NONE had the authors visit them in over 4 years!  Worse than prices are phone numbers and access codes.  I challenge the authors to call the numbers in the book - I am willing to buy them a plane ticket if calling the numbers gives the right destination more than 50% of the time.  I know that's a low expectation rate to give someone a plane ticket, but that is exactly how inaccurate this guide is. E.g. try calling the numbers in Cayo Santa Maria.  We asked the Department of Telecommunication if there had been any recent systematic changes in the telephone numbers and they answered in the negative.  Outside these 2 main sub thematic issues, the maps in LP Cuba were highly inaccurate.  One of our favourite reminders of Cuba was coming across many tourists at major junctions looking at the maps from LP Cuba trying to make some sense. Another was when we were driving through Santa Clara for one hour in search for a recommended wellness/massage place that does not exist anywhere close to where it is marked on the map (actually, none of the Cubans we have been asking has ever heard of the place).  Furthermore, the new layout made it VERY hard to find things.  Please go back to the old layout - it made more sense.  I don't know if other readers had gripes but it was very complex going back and forth as opposed to the ease of the last format.  Our hope from this letter is to encourage Lonely Planet to conduct a systematic review of their guide to Cuba.  Moreover, it is to remind to LP that irrespective of their disclaimers, tourists do depend on them and basic expectations warrant the authors to conduct thorough investigations before sending a book to print.  If there are any other questions, both of us are available via the internet to answer them.  We sincerely hope LP takes our feedback into consideration and incorporates them into the next edition of its travel guide to Cuba.   Warm Regards, MO, A 
 I read this book before reading it to my little one and I am glad I did.  Not only does it not have a positive message, it is a story of rewarded laziness and greed.  And the message is not subtle either, it is all out  there in the first line .."Jamie O'Rourke was the laziest man in all  of Ireland." -- and he was still so at the end of the book -- and  proud of it! The only decent aspect of the book are the illustrations which  are very nice, but alas not enough to risk sending a totally wrong message  to our children 
 The trouble starts early. There is an apologetic preamble which states that the author(s) would not dedicate precious space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community. This is an enormous assumption about the general public's knowledge - both of video games and more-so it's history of design. Many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs, most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment.  Even though Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger, etc. are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize, and (b) learn from. If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the 'new-time' classics? The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are questionable. The brief smattering of 'classics' that are shown tend to be more human-looking figurative than 'iconic' which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation.  Beyond this much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather 'same-y' to me. Lots of brooding dark scene-scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters such as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal. When there is mention of games that are actually considered modern art on display at world-famous museums, such as "Rez," -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft(!) in the same spread. One has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?  The fact of the matter is that for all the long-winded talk in the intro there is little to graphically show us where the industry came from verses where we are now. And from what I can tell, there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and utterly unique designs being done in FLASH. Arguably one of the largest and least expensive/complicated environments for making a unique game. Furthermore, all the games covered and talked about (that I can tell) are from very large corporations and as such tend to be slanted and biased in a number of regards.  My biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art. Far too many examples if things that look the same versus examples of unique design concepts and forms as well as proper representations for an historical analysis. Very nice printing, some nice layouts, and some interesting topics are raised with relation to character conception versus form, versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design analysis or critical anything 
 If you're not either very experienced in outsourcing already or a college level instructor in outsourcing, I would not recommend this book.  Since it was written, a couple more creative and straight shooting books on "how to outsource" are available, particularly in 2005.  I advise you to search and find those books independently as I found them much more enlightening, current and relevant to providing directions on outsourcing's nuts and bolts to true strategic and transformational outsourcing elsewhere. Outsourcing has evolved along way since this book was written. It needs updating or should simply be viewed as a reference book after you've read the recent selections by other authors to be on top of your game 
 The Quest was one of the movies that began the descent of Jean-Claude Van Damme from a major motion picture star into a straight-to-video movie star, which still is better than most actors accomplish, but far from the level that Van Damme achieved at the height of his success.  The Quest is a poor ripoff of Bloodsport and Kickboxer about a martial arts tournament with Roger Moore thrown in for comic relief. While there are some good fight scenes, they don't make this film worth watching or buying. Fortunately, Jean-Claude made many more that are worth watching 
 In the years since September 11th, 2001 many authors have tried their hands at the 9/11 novel, with all of its delicate subject matter, and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success: Jonathan Safran Foer, Julia Glass, Wendy Wasserstein, and others have centered novels on the pre- and post-9/11 era, and now Claire Messud takes her turn with "The Emperor's Children," a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day. The titular 'emperor' is Murray Thwaite, a prestigious journalist living the quintessential Manhattan lifestyle: fame, money, parties, and the adoration of literati and socialites alike. He has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity, although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person. His 'children' are the people immediately surrounding him, captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness. At the novel's onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life's direction. First and foremost is Marina, Murray's daughter, who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence -- afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father's reputation (the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her). It is easy to forget that Marina is 30 years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite. Then there is Murray's nephew, Frederick "Bootie" Tubb,  who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to Manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor. Bootie, an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man, quickly becomes disillusioned with Murray (for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces?), and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be. Complicating things further is Ludovic Seeley, a smarmy Australian businessman who has come to Manhattan to start his own magazine -- and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king. Ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon. Lastly, there are Marina's best friends: Julius, a gay hanger-on from chilly Michigan eager to make an impression on the New York social scene, and Danielle, who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on, but suffers from such ludicrous Ally McBeal-esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages. The characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying, but Messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because, as shallow as they are, they are all multi-layered, complex, believable people. The many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies (even if you wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them). But that willingness to stick with their stories is, at least for me, predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel's end. They aren't. And while the narrative is expertly crafted, Messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes, increasingly, irritating, as she uses them to stretch out her sentences, and to add separate thoughts, or descriptive elements, and even, occasionally, dialogue, so that they feel like run-ons, like this one right here, this example I've devised for you, but are, for the most part, technically, grammatically sound, even though you may have to re-read the most trying sentences a second time, just to figure out what she is saying, without letting all of her distractions get in the way.   Messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and September 11th draws near. There is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found, some directly indicating that September will be a month of great change, what with Ludovic's magazine set to launch on the 13th and a wedding to take place, but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be. The sense of impending disaster looms large in "The Emperor's Children," and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes. Indeed, 9/11 is almost anticlimactic when it occurs, serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone's story lines. It was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed. In the late afternoon of that day, after the towers had fallen and Manhattan's skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn't a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters. All they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars (I felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when Ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine's launch had to be cancelled). I live in the tri-state area, about an hour and a half away from Ground Zero, and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life, and what Messud has critically failed to capture is the way that 9/11 actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time, and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand. I remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other, the phone calls I made to -- and received from -- people I hadn't even spoken to in months or even years, just to make sure that they were all right. I remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out, whether the need was great or small. This incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world, but it is conspicuously absent from Messud's telling. One character uses the tragedy for personal gain career-wise, one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity (not for anything to do with 9/11, mind you, but for strictly personal reasons) ... I don't want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much, but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate. I had hoped that tragedy would change the Emperor and his Children for the better, but I was wrong. And it's a shame. Messud is definitely a capable, promising writer -- but this isn't her finest hour 
 This book didn't tell me anything I didn't know already 
 The [money] I spent on this book was a waste. The arthur used his reputation to peddle a inferior book on training. The book may work in middle schools, but one could easily find more in depth articles online and in journals. Very little is given in terms of theory or application and more emphasis is given to rudimentary biological processes. I find this book to be a complete waste of a few hours better spent elsewhere 
 I found the writer, Crane, dying to interpose his bad poetry, bad jokes and whining, obnoxious self into what could have been a thoughtful story about a monk and his religious beliefs.  Too bad 
 It's a real snoozer.  The subject matter sounded very interesting to me (I'm a public school teacher), but this book just didn't deliver.  I found the main character annoying and lacking in just about any redeeming qualities.  I really wasn't rooting for her at all.  The author seems to have thrown in an affair to add to the plot, but I found that those sections left me feeling uncomfortable (and not in a thought provoking way; more like an "eewwww" way).  I had hoped this story would be funny or a bit scathing.  I found it to be lukewarm.  Save your money unless you need a book to help you fall asleep; even then, I'd buy some Tylenol PM...it's cheaper 
 A joke that swept through The University of Texas a long time ago:  A freshman physics teacher at Texas A&M asked his class to name the greatest invention of all times.  One student said fire.  Another said gunpowder.  Another said the internal combustion engine.  Then a Texas A&M football player on the front row said, "The thermos bottle."  When asked by the teacher why he would pick that as the greatest invention, the student said, "You put something hot in it and it stays hot.  You put something cold in it and it stays cold."  The teacher asked why that made it great, and the student replied, "How do it know which to do?"  That thermos bottle is in this book in the form of a magic (indistinguishable from magic) sphere.  I liked the first book, in spite of its "magical" science.  This novel seemed like a shaggy dog story leading to the thermos bottle.  Much ado about little 
 What a pile of vapid tripe. Reading this book actually lowered my IQ. I quess I could've felt stupider, I could've actually paid for this book. If the overexcessive use of the terms "darling", "amazing", and "delicious" don't give you the douche-chills, then you might actually be able to plod your way through this refuse without wanting to take a hot iron to each of the characters' faces. Anyone who likes this vacuous load of landfill fodder probably thinks that Paris Hilton is a great musician 
 Does anyone even care that the "Author" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.  This book is Propaganda. Period 
 he gets 2 for 2 good songs in the whole cd!this cd blows 
 This album starts with the terrific "Loser's Day Parade", but everything after is weak by comparison.  Even if there is some good production, there's little quality songwriting after this first track.  Tracks 2 & 3 have good moments, but each have at least one overwhelmingly cheesy part that makes you not want to play it for your friends.  After track 3, I'm totally done with this.  If Kino kept the quality of the first track throughout, this would no doubt be a 4 or 5 star effort 
 I picked up this book because the story looked interesting; little did I know that this book would be so horrible I would put it down in the middle.  Good grief!  Unfortunately, Gail Tsukiyama has a nasty habit of writing choppy books.  She'll touch on one idea for about a page, never really going in-depth, then move on.  In addition, the characters all seemed one-dimensional and never convinced me to care about them.  As a result, Gail Tsukiyama's work came off as very amateur-ish and unworthy of my time.  For good fiction about Asian women, please read some of Amy Tan's older works or Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha.  
 I had not realized what great performers Michael Flatley, Colin Dunne and Jean Butler were until I watched this version of Riverdance. The lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions. What made Riverdance great for me was the precision, timing, and dancers dancing togeather in the Irish dance numbers. It is all gone here. Try "Riverdance: Live from New York City" or the video tape "Riverdance: The Show" instead. This version should not have been released 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 SD110 NOT A GOOD DIGITAL CAMERA. BETTER YET FIND SOMETHING ELSE. I'VE HAD THIS CAMERA ALMOST A YEAR BUT I JUST SELDOM USE IT BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THE PICTURES ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING. IT IS JUST FINE DOWNLOADING THEM ON THE INTERNET BUT WHEN YOU HAVE IT PRINTED ON THE PAPER, THE PICTURES GET BLURRED. NOW,IM LOOKING FOR ANOTHER DIGICAM THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT ME 
 i would hate to say anything to discourage young people who are interested in writing. however, having read this book after all the publicity it received from the media and the press, i have to confess that i was not satisfied with it at all as far as my expectations were concerned. i cannot say i've gotten anything out of it except the pity it left me with for all the things she had done to herself and/or let others to do to her if this book is based on the writer's own real experiences as said ofcourse. i have also bought and read the new one out by her named "L'odore del tuo respiro", which has become available this month where i live, and unfortunately, i don't think she is getting any better 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 It is to bad that someone so capable of telling a good tale could take a dive with such vivid subject matter at his disposal. It is extremely over priced for  such a dismal read. Anyone who has purchased the Box set has read pretty much the same info given in this minute pamplet of wash. We need a vision of this man not a paint by numbers acount of times,places and song verses. Then again If you do not know the tale of johnson then this is the book for you. let me also highly recomend Robert palmers book Deep Blues. Also the finest attempt to give an acurate portrayal of such a god is the book LOVE in VAIN by Alan Greenberg.. 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 This book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book (this has been noted by others) Anything of interest is said in the first chapter, followed by a lot of fluff - "sometimes the crowd is wise" "sometimes the crowd is not wise".  After the first chapter, I seriously couldn't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored 
 Poor plot, unnecessary ramblings. Potentially interesting drug stories described by a man with a rich vocabulary and nothing else. It didn't keep me interested and I felt like I was dragging my feet everytime I turned a page. I found myself looking for perhaps something deeper and more profound in the book. Instead, I found more stories about mescaline and stupid drug-inpired ramblings 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 I am a mother grieving for the lost of a wonderful son. During my six month's grief journey I have read numereous books on how to walk this journey.  I was in hopes that Nicholas Wolterstorff's book, "Lament for a Son" would be of comfort and enlightenment to me.  I was wrong.  Instead of uniting the grieving reader with him this book gave me very little comfort, instead it angered me.  Instead of human speak Mr. Wolterstorff gave me academic speak.  I will not be keeping this book, nor passing it on to another one in need.  Respectfully, Hellen Spear, Glendora, C 
 This case is too large for general carrying of a DVD player. There were too many velcro straps included without instructions or ideas on how to use them. Pictures were on the package, however I couldn't figure most of them out. 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 The book may be entertaining to read because of the way Mankiw sets his examples. Unfortunately what we have in our hands is the same irrealistic exposition of how the economy works that has been dominating university curriculums from the first day Adam Smith was appointed at Glasgow. As an example I may cite my personal experience as a teaching assistant. When explaining the comparative advantage theory I obviously gave the Ricardian demonstration of the theory. But when I wanted to treat the absolute advantage theory, Marx's name was nowhere to be found. Even Samuelson devoted some pages to Marx's contribution to economic theory. President Bush's economic advisor seems to lack objective exposition when dealing with basic economic theories. I don't consider myself to be paranoid, but the economics curriculum, and it's instruments, such as this book, only serve a mode of reproduction of the dominant ideology, which we all know has lots of contradictions that everyday spring up in everybody's life. It is time to bring to the market a more balanced exposition of the various tendencies within economics, even if the course is described as being introductory. Most of the people who take these basic courses don't even know that there are alternative paradigms. They just finish their Mankiw's as if nothing else could be thought about how the economy really works 
 Joel Coen and Ethan Coen's "Fargo" is a dull and listless film.  A glance at the Coens' filmography reveals that they have produced some amusing fare in their careers.  Too bad this outing is a misfire.     A Minnesota car salesman named Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) conspires with Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap and ransom his wife.  Jerry has hatched this plan to help ease his financial troubles and believes his father-in-law will be more than willing to come up and with the money to spring his daughter.  However, the plan quickly unravels and the conspirators' missteps attract the unwanted attention of the local police chief, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).   McDormand and Macy turn in wonderful performances as the two central characters.  Yet, both of them find themselves stuck in a story that is of minimal interest to the viewer.  The absurd situations and skewed humor that characterize "Fargo" are only good for a chuckle here and there.  In fact, the desolate snowy landscape is the only aspect of the film that leaves a lasting impression.  The scenery so overwhelms the story that you find yourself passing the time by contemplating the awesome power of nature instead of paying attention to the proceedings.  The bottom line is that the Coens have done better work.  You time would be better spent watching "Blood Simple" (1984) or "Miller's Crossing" (1990) instead.            
 This was a very disappointing story. I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time 
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field 
 Four Corners is the title of this collection of photos by Debra Bloomfield, who refers to herself as a landscape photographer. Four Corners is a well-know region of the country which includes an incredible number of stunning places to memorialize in landscape photos. I was disappointed to discover that 26 of the 67 color plates depicted iconic paintings and objects inside old New Mexican churches--that is almost 40% of the book has nothing to do with landscape, but rather with local culture.   The other great disappointment with the book is the very poor quality of reproduction. With the tools available today, this quality of printing is inexcuseable. The few photos that might have been truly interesting are so dark and muddy that their virtues go virtually unseen.   If you want to see the Four Corners of the title, look elsewhere 
 This review is for the Spanish edition ONLY which I recently purchased (ISBN:8498160162, publisher: Linkgua).  Note, that this is an ABRIDGED EDITION (edición abreviada) and is not true to the original text, this is evident commencing with the first sentence of the book. The reader will get the general idea of the novel, but will not read the words as written be the author.  I submit here an example of the above-mentioned sentence:  ABRIDGED EDITION (ISBN 8498160162): A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido vulgarmente con el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que era el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en los demás arrabales y hasta dentro de la ciudad.  ORIGINAL TEXT: A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido popularmente bajo el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que, sin embargo de haberlo anunciado aquella tarde tan sólo, contra su costumbre, era ya el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en otros arrabales y hasta en Intramuros.  This editing is consistent throughout every paragraph in the book.   If you just want a good read, then this edition will suffice. It is an excellent novel. However, if you are an admirer of the Spanish language, please get your hands on the original version.  
 An incredibly bad film, whose only redeeming feature is Lana Clarkson, in (and out of) some skimpy outfits.  She's completely gorgeous, but even she can't save a disaster of a film.  Buy Deathstalker instead 
 Well as an EQ coach, and someone who studies nonverbal communication, it's interesting - and very illuminating -- that you can take one of the best scripts ever written, and leave the words as is, and come off (in this case) with a decidedly inferior product.  What's fascinating is this is like the undrebelly, the in side, of history.  What it was like for a family.  One thing that's good about the video is the outake and discussion at the end.  But this review is going to be all about - what WERE they thinking?  Who could follow O'Toole and Hepburn.  That's really the bottom line.  I can't imagine anyone present-day doing a better job than Glen Close, but she can't quite, and King Henri doesn't make the cut either. They have no power - as characters or as people.  I agree the sets aren't as good either.  They manage to make some of the lines even sound silly.  The one thing that's marvelous in this version -- FAR better -- is the King of France.  What a fantastic job Jonathan Rhys-Meyers did, and what a gorgeous young man.  Save your money.  See the original.  There's no, NO comparison.  
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 This book was written in 1981 and, unfortunately, it hasn't aged well.  It is loaded with unfulfilled sky-is-falling, doom-and-gloom predictions that look pretty silly in retrospect. I have great respect for Foster's other books, but this one is in desperate need of a rewrite -- with a lot less agitprop and a lot more spirituality 
 This book has little story and a lot of bad porn. Read only if you are into fairy sex 
 These are short essays on 100 of Roger's favorite movies. Even though Roger has studied many of these films shot by shot there is no thorough deconstruction of these movies. Most are 3 page essays with synopsis and commentary on themes. But, serious film students can learn from this as well as the layman.  This IS a great book by a movie critic who I agree with less than half the time. Lately, I think Roger has seen one too many movies. He's not as discerning as he once was and he's far too forgiving of a lot of the mediocrity that's foisted on us by the Hollywood Money Machine. I disagree with his recent assessment of movies such as SPIDERMAN 2, KILL BILL VOL. 2, SIN CITY, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and THE CLEARING, which was the worst movie of 2004. But, if you think he's just a Pop Culture movie critic, think again. He's won a Pulitzer prize, and his commentary for the CITIZEN KANE DVD is a must hear for any serious student of filmmaking.   I DO agree with his inclusion of almost all of the classics listed here. Some of his favorites are also mine. On DVD, I own 42 of the 100 films he essays here. Some I call "movies," some are "films." His taste mirrors my own in many ways. Especially his love of black and white films. And his love for Oliver Stone's masterpiece, JFK. But, for different reasons than Roger states here. Roger has changed his opinion about this film after his initial review because he received an undeserved tongue lashing from Walter Cronkite, who apparently knows nothing about the facts of the Kennedy assassination, and was probably mad because his 1963 broadcast likeness announcing Kennedy's death was used in the film without his knowledge. Now Roger says he loves it for it's "mood." Shame on you, Roger, for revising your original statements concerning this great film. I love JFK for the sheer force of it's propaganda, for being more right than wrong(Stone did his homework on this film), and for Kostner's performance(I cry every time he gives his final court room summation. So did Kostner when his was reciting the words. It's Garrison's actual speech from the trial, which Roger fails to mention here). It's also a marvel of film Editing and changing film stocks; which IS touched on by Roger. It's easily the most important film of the 20th Century. Because of it's controversy, Congress passed the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, mandating that records be opened to researchers from the National Archives(what's was left of them, anyway. Oswald's files were completely destroyed). But, in recent years Roger has backpedaled on it's importance.   Great old movies that might go unnoticed by modern MOVIE GOERS are treated as essential viewing for FILM LOVERS(the distinction is mine, not Roger's). A lot of people have seen SEVEN SAMURAI, but how many people have seen Kurosawa's emotional masterpiece IKIRU? Hopefully many more now that Roger has written an essay on it. Other great inclusions are: THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, DETOUR(a rotten low-budget B FILM NOIR), Buster Keaton's THE GENERAL, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT(I'm an Elvis man myself, so I would have thrown in JAILHOUSE ROCK too), LE SAMOURAI, Charles Laughton's only directorial outing, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER with the great Robert Mitchum, Disney's PINOCCHIO, Astaire & Rogers SWING TIME, Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, Wim Wender's marvelous art film WINGS OF DESIRE, Ozu's FLOATING WEEDS(personally I would have gone with his tearjerker TOKYO STORY). And the best inclusion is THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, with it's odd and bombastic dialogue. It's one the most elegant pieces of FILM NOIR about bottom feeding rats ever written. And Roger knows it. Bravo!!   My only hope is that Roger will reassess Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. This film is GONE WITH THE WIND for my generation. It's a masterpiece that I call the SISTINE CHAPEL OF CINEMA. To see this film and not be completely moved by it, is like going to Vatican City, seeing the chapel, and saying, "Eh, it was alright." It's belongs in one of his books.  I just ordered THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC from Criterion after reading his essay on it. I've never seen it and Roger has me intrigued.   This book of essays deserves a WHOPPING 5 STARs. But, the reason I'm giving this one STAR is because the PAPERBACK fell apart in my hands after getting half way through it. A reviewer below had the same problem. THE BINDING IS TERRIBLE.  DEFINITELY GO WITH THE HARDBOUND VERSION.  ENJOY. 
 President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries.  It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added.  It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out 
 The Premise: Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is travelling home on the last flight of the night (the red eye) to Miami where she lives and works as a hotel manager for a prestigeous hotel after attending the funeral for her late grandmother. Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) is a mysterious and charming stranger she meets in the airport who as it turns out is not so coincidentally taking the same flight as she is.  Rippner's reason for travel is strictly business. It so happens an assassination is planned on the Secretary of Homeland Security while he stays at Lisa's hotel. Rippner needs Lisa to call the hotel and arrange for the Secretary to stay in a different room. If she doesn't comply, he has a man waiting outside her fathers home to kill him.  Thoughts: This was one of my few experiences with Wes Craven's (Director) work who is most known for the horrible genre of teenage slasher films I despise. I had dismissed this film in theatres without giving a second thought, and when I finally saw it last night I knew next to nothing of what it was about. From what I vaguely remembered of the previews, and given Craven's reputation, I was honestly expecting Rippner to be a supernatural character such as a vampire. In hindsite, I think 'Vampire on a Plane' woulda been a much better foundation for a film.  To call this film's premise shaky is as kind as it is unfair. It's unfair because the core plot points could prove to be an interesting thriller. The problem with this film is how it executes those points. A hotel manager? The Secretary of Homeland Security? Give me a break! Make it the Deputy Director of the FBI and the President of the United States and we have a plotline that warrants all of this hullabaloo. The concept of this film has potential, but how it was staged is just too ridiculous. Are we really to believe that the Secretary of Homeland Security is that important that such an elaborate scheme to assassinate him would be put in place. Are we really to believe that the only way this assassination (which involves missles did I tell you? I won't say anymore) can be pulled off is if the manager of the hotel can get the Secretary to stay in a different room? And who are these nameless caucaisions who want the secretary killed? And why?  The premise isn't only shaky, it's totally gutless. It sickens me that Hollywood is so afraid of offending anyone that neither the antagonist nor their motives can in any way reflect real world people, situations or beliefs. It forces me to recall the debacle of the last adaptation of the great Jack Ryan thrillers by Tom Clancy, The Sum of all Fears. In that film, instead of having militant muslim terrorists acquire a nuclear warhead lost by Isreal (which truly is something to fear), they decided to go with Nazi's. Heaven forbid we offend all the militant muslim terrorists of the world by portraying them as the evil stain on humankind that they are. I digress. My point is simply that Red Eye doesn't even go that far. It has no voice. It doesn't tell us anything, and worse, it's too spineless to put a face on fear.  There are some good things about the film. First and foremost is the cast. While Rachel McAdams is completely not believable as a manager of a prestigious Miami hotel, that part of her character is more of sidenote and it's a fault of casting more than her acting anyway. Cillian Murphy is very talented, and he has a look that allows him to come off as charming one moment and creepy the next. I still wish he woulda turned out to be a vampire though. Finally we have the legendary Brian "Better than Anthony Hopkins as Hannible Lector" Cox. He's such a great actor, but in this film he's relegated to the most menial of roles. Almost every scene he's in is him answering the phone, being woken up by the phone, or picking up the morning paper.  The film is ok in it's first two acts, with the second act being the strongest part of the film where Rachel and Cillian have performances confined mostly to their seats on the plane. It's here that the tension builds, and the performances really hold the scenes. Then comes the third act were the film just breaks down in to complete ludicrousness. The story continues off the plane and gives up completely on being an intellectual thriller. Instead it goes for the action route and follows just about every cliche for a movie of this type.  The Verdict: Red Eye has an interesting idea that could have beened turned into something a lot better under a more able screenwriter and director. The actors performances do the best they can to keep this ship afloat. If you can ignore the ridiculous parts of this film which are about as far fetched as your typical network TV thrillers, then you may find some enjoyment your first time through. It's not horrible, but neither is it really good

 We paid extra for expedited shipping in the hopes that the package would arrive on Saturday before Christmas or at the latest, the Tuesday after Christmas.  The package, in fact, did not arrive unitl after New Years and an email to the Seller went unanswered.  We felt that we should be reimbursed for the amount that we paid to have the expedited shipping 
 The episodes for Naruto are quality but in this case, due to errors in the description I can not recommend the DVD.  When I ordered the DVD, I made sure to check the language options of the DVD.  This one indicates that a Japanese language option is available.  Unfortunately this is incorrect.  If you do not mind this being an all english DVD with the television broadcast editting, than this is for you.  Naruto is not so far editted compared to other anime series that the series is hampered and the english actors do a relatively good job with the translation.  However, if you prefer the japanese version, this DVD is not for you. 
 I saw them live, I have all the Original LP's I watched the 1968 concert on the BBC. This offering is far removed from the way I remember them. All of cream are the same age as I am, and it showed. Poor Jack was recovering from surgery and has lost is voice and stamina. Ginger was subdued but who would have expected him to still be alive. Eric, well he was just going through the motions. But the biggest criticism, as mentioned by others, was Clapton using the strat' instead of the Les Paul Gibson. They just didn't sound right. Having said this, it's Cream I bought the CD anyway 
 Corny beyond words, only one good track "Fly With Me" the rest, I dislike very.   I'd reccomend Avril Lavigne Ashlee Simpson Or Even N'Sync But not this trash! 
 This book should be pulped. Maushart is entitled to her own interpretations of the literature but her analysis falls woefully short, first in her over-reliance upon feminist theories on gender oppression to explain poor or weak marriages; and second from her unwillingness to acknowledge the change happening around her. Maushart seems more of a woman with a grudge to bear than an author with a possibly important message. If her true stories were from the experiences of other women (indicating research), I, for one, might have been able to stomach her biased diatribe. Every choice comes down to a yes or no. Maushart twice said yes. If offered the choice again she should do some research before making a decision 
 I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle 
 What a load of turnspeak.  G. Orwell (deceased 
 I purchased this book based on the comments and reviews of other readers.  So, I made the mistake of  thinking that this was a book on advanced Chinese astrology. This is elementary Chinese astrology.  Which is  equivalent to looking up your sun sign in your local newspaper. If you're  serious about learning Chinese astrology, then try and find a book on Zi  Ping Four Pillars of Destiny 
 I prefer reading romance novels and bought this thinking there would be romance in it, but there was none.  This is a mystery thriller with Anita who is human trying to solve the mystery of who is killing vampires.  It is written in first person, as told by Anita.  She talks in the style of a 1950's private detective.  She sounds like a jaded, tough guy making sarcastic remarks to almost everyone, including those about to kill her.  Her ability to kill vampires and others could be described as follows.  She is fighting creatures who are tougher than her or outnumber her, but she keeps fighting, doesn't give into fear, tries to distract them, and usually gets lucky and wins, using knives and guns.  I did not enjoy reading this.  I kept wishing it would be over 
 "With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. "  "Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit."  It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however 
 Much like her other book, "Wild Swans", this is another piece of Imperialist-apology and anti-Communism that would make Joe McCarthy proud.  It reads like cheap fiction, and in the end, has little historical value.   Read "Red Star Over China", "Fanshen", and "From Ike to Mao" instead. 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
    Why daughters need their moms, I don;t think this book quite get's it.   It seems more atitle, just so the authors can make some money off of it.    The so-called touching photos that show moms and daughters together do not really show any touching emotion that they are suppoed to convey.   I've seen better moving scenes of Daughters hugging their Moms in Orange Juice TV adds.   Sure, maybe the best was intented with this book, but it does not deliver 
 This CD has one objective - push a leftist agenda. It's themes are awash in "class struggles" and pushes everything from the perspective of the persecuted poor. It even has a short piece on considering the food's point of view when eating meat. This is the worst sort of leftist propaganda trash, and we do our children no favors by bashing everything and everyone that might not be one of the downtrodden.. 
 This book had all the hallmarks of a diet memoir: it was self-indulgent, solipsistic, whiny and asinine. After reading it I ate a pint of Haagen Dazs Vanilla and decided that I blame nobody but myself. It was liberating. I am so sick of people who sit around name-dropping and blame everybody--their mother, their sister, their friends--for their fat butts. The worst part of this book was that it wasn't even well-written! Courtney should quit her day job. 
 I am not an expert on pop culture, or the impact of various shows/movements/performers on pop culture, but after reading this book, I know that neither is Chris Turner.  His rambling style of writing makes it a difficult read, as others here have mentioned, but I think the biggest problem is that he implies a great plan behind every joke, an agenda behind every smirk.  Sometimes this is true, and sometimes a gag is just a gag.  For instance, he elevates the "Sideshow Bob rake bit" to a level I would argue it doesn't deserve.  Please, pass on this book.  
 I love Southern hip-hop. From Cunninlynguists to UGK; from Three Six Mafia to OutKast. Goodie MOb, T.I., Devin the Dude, Chamillionaire, Slim Thug, Young Buck..I've been known to rock with most hip-hop below the Mason-Dixon line. 8Ball and MJG are two individuals I've heard countless times on guest appearances, but never heard an entire album of material from. They're legends, of sorts, in the Southern region, and have inspired many of my favorite emcees today. It seems like that would fit snugly in my collection, but this album possibly turned me off of the Memphis duo for good.  It's not that 8Ball or MJG are particularily bad emcees. 8Ball's actually got a pretty interestesting flow, while MJG..well, to be completely honest, he doesn't bring much of anything to the table, other than counter-balancing 8Ball's husky, raw flow with nothing more than mediocrity. He's the Pimp C to 8Ball's Bun B, albeit not nearly as charismatic as the Pimpulation leader. Their lyrics are typical Southern fare, and I didn't expect anything more from them; to be totally up front with you, it wasn't 8Ball and MJG that turned me off of this album.  It was the horrible production. With Southern hip-hop, I've come to expect phat, and funky beats of very high quality; the production on these albums should be of the highest quality, and the budgets should be particularily large. Seeing and 8B&MJG are on Bad Boy, they should have more than enough money to get the Timbalands, Just Blazes, and Polow Da Dons of the music industry, but 8B&MJG get stuck with uninspired beats from Jazze Pha, Lil' Jon, and Hypnotized Minds, unknown producers, and a Timbaland-less Danja. It's obvious there was far too much Diddy involvement on this album, as it is certainly overly glossy. What surprises me is Yung Joc's album had a rawer sound musically than this, which is more proof that Diddy is trying to hard to make these two raw Southern emcees pop stars. If Diddy left this album alone, and left 8B&MJG be themselves, then it could've been a lot better.  There are some decent cuts, but they don't fill out nearly enough of the album to boost this score too much. When the beat's hot, such as on Clap On, 30 Rocks, Memphis, and Get Low, this album is deserving of all the publicity and promotion it got; however, the rest of the album falls below the line of mediocrity. 8Ball and MJG are by no means bad rappers, and I'm sure their older material is of much higher quality than this; I know their guest appearances were considerabley tighter than anything found on here. However, Ridin' High has soured my opinion on the duo, at least as long as they're on the Bad Boy imprint, and I'd recommend everyone, fan or not, to skip this album 
 The examples are not clear and complete enough. Even my Stats professor said he didn't like the way the book was made. I know Stats involves a lot of word problems but the book is uncessarilly wordy 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 I bought this book after reading several positive reviews on it. However, I was very disappointed with it. The author attempted to make the book culturally diverse and inclusively based, but I did not find her method effective. I did not like the premise of the book that in order to be acceptable to others, there have to be commonalities. Differences as well as similarities should be embraced to better understand the individual. Stereotypes and finding similarities are not necessary in describing or understanding individuals 
 Amazon image appears to be of standard edition while text without explanation of this being miniature press is buried far below. Looks like a crackerjack prize and contains only slightly more info. Very disappointing 
 This movie turned me off with its focus on Nash's schizophrenia rather than his monumental achievements. Three-fourths of the movie turns out to be Nash's delusion. I felt like a voyeur, entertained by someone else's pain.  At the end, I wasn't even certain of exactly what it was that Nash had developed....just that he was a brilliant mathematician and severely ill. The barbaric "medical treatment" of the 1950s left me feeling sick.   A documentary would have been far more entertaining. Nash is a brilliant man despite, not because of, his illness, and I found this movie (especially since much of it is fictionalized) to be exploitive. Only two stars 
 Iam a big fan of lindsey's work in Fleetwood Mac but this was terrable!!! It just goes to show he is nothing with out Stevie Nicks. I was a fool in buying something i never hered about before. I should have listen to my mum and got Sevie's new album, "Trouble in Shangri-La" which is doing exelent on the radio and charts. The only reason i gave it a 2 star is because i feel sorry for him! 
 This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days 
  Island of the blue dolphin written by Scott O'dell,was a great book. I recomend this book to 5th grade and up, dew to the books hard vocabulary. I like this book because of the exitement, adventures, and drama of karanas life on the island alone.Island of the blue dolphin is for people who like to read about survivle and adventure.I dont think people who only like to read about comedys mysteries shouldent read the book.   Island of the blue dolphinis about a girl who gets stuck on an island by herselfand learns how to survie and has a big adventure on the way. The main charcter of this story is karana. Karanas village was fleeing the island, but her brother forgot his spear and ran back.the ship left ,and karana threw her self out the boat to be with her brother. Shortly after,Karanas brother was killed by wiled dogs.Karana is now on the island alone.   
 Not really impressed with this product. It applies okay, but the colors look really bright and odd on. The colors do fade over time and I do not recommend this product. I like Lancome's eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice 
 The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  Her characters are hardly believable:  Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  Very disappointing 
 It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash. 
 Howard Bryant's Juicing the Game reads like a history book, a chronilogical epic full of dates, names and enane details that bore the reader into missing the dynamics that make the last 10 years in baseball interesting.  The book is too concerned about sticking with the facts to expose any insight from players, doctor's or front office staff that expose any real scoop.  The players rhetoric is exactly what we have been reading in his own newspaper for 10 years.  I feel I now must read Conseco's next book of lies to at least have a chance of understanding what the players really experienced through this drug age 
 I love the "smoky" piano bar sound of this album.  I picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh 
 My first Philippa Gregory book was "The Queen's Fool"  which I throughly enjoyed.  I could not waited to have time to sit and read!  So as I was towards the end of "The Queen's Fool" I began to see what other books were available by this author.  I bought "The Virgin's Lover" since to seemed to follow "The Queen's Fool".  Within the first 36 pages, I was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel.  TOO MUCH BOUNCING ABOUT WITH THE TIME FRAME.  And the time frames within the book do not match those in "The Queen's Fool".  For instance, in "The Queen's Fool"  Queen Mary dies in Winter 1558 but in "The Virgin's Lover" The Queen dies in Autumn 1558.  Another example is Lord Robert.  In "The Queen's Fool" Lord Robert lives at St. James Palace (Autumn 1558) and presses Queen Mary to name an heir (Winter 1558).  However, in "The Virgin's Lover" Lord Robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife's StepMother's.                                                                   I think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use Seasons.  Winter 1558....is this November December or January February?  Because further in the book the use of Winter 1558-59 is used. The back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book.  I spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review 
 This product is only approved for CASIO keyboards. and only like three of those. Wish I would have known before hand 
 A shining star in the quest for the most incomplete work ever published by credible institutions, David Griffiths triumphs over both the competition and his other works with his widely-distributed Third Edition of Introduction to Electrodynamics.  The useful life of this book is 6 months, as that is how long it takes physics students to complete the intermediate level sequence on electricity and magnetism. Because most of the meaningful content of this book that would make it (at least) more complete gets reproduced by teachers in classroom lectures, both graduate students and undergraduate students must redo homework problems, never again to know if their answer is correct, in reassurance that they still know the concepts that they were taught months or years ago. Even the few sections of the book with worded analysis instead of mathematical analysis depend so strongly on the mathematics once again that without a complete word-based definition and explanation, no student can sit down with the book for any less than 30 minutes at a time to identify and restudy key concepts. In fact, the only chance that students have of cutting out 29 of those 30 minutes is by looking at the formulas in the front and back covers of the book, many (particularly those in the back) of which students should already have memorized from completing the sequence. If only Griffiths would add "By looking in the back of the book" before spitting out "Easy" or "Obviously" every few sections, students would not be so nearly put down by such a travesty of a science textbook.  The impossibility for students to learn from the hundreds of missing steps in derivations throughout the book (which you get to see in their entirety for the price of your tuition), the lack of page references or useful word-based explanations of terms, and Griffith's "obvious" attitude problem serve to make Introduction to Electrodynamics the worst book ever 
 This is a very bad book once you get past your self-conscious fear that you are missing something--I would say an alarmingly bad book: one has to wonder why this manuscript was submitted, and if submitted, not edited. This turns into a repetition of the allusive and graceful, for sure,  but unsubstantiated shtick of the by-now facile co-mingling of forms and genres, made even weaker by a lack of discipline to corral digressive discursions and courage to present arguments in at least occassionally straightforward logical presentation--this is all riffing on material we've seen before and it repeats and repeats and repeats itself. Yes, we can treat "Yahweh" as a purely literary-textual rather than an embedded national-cultic figure whose text was never naked and whose narrative was never uninstantiated in an actual religious-national culture (itself progentive but not, as a culture, textual-canonical), and compare this to the figure of "Jesus Christ as God" and then, propose a Gnostic trope of Yahweh's self-shrinkage in internally distancing (and neurotic) "zimzum."  Presumably we could also describe quantum mechanics in a poetical fashion and discourse freely on the feline qualities of Schrodinger bifurcated cattiness vis a vis the solid roundness of Newtonian physical matter--except we would be missing what was substantive and unique about the actual subject matter.   I will let Christians decide whether the oft-repeated and repeated remark that Jesus Christ is not Yahweh is meaningful or provocative for them; as a semi-agnostic Jew I would agree that Christianity has not supplanted Judaism and that Judaism will and must always attempt to define itself on its own terms. Still, I must wonder what this observation, when it comes for the second, fifth, and tenth time, actually tells us about the plurality of Second Commonwealth Judaisms, the full Gestalt of "Yahwehism" throughout patriarchal, Rabbinic, and mystical literature, or, indeed, the "Jewishness" of classic Christian doctrinal claims in an age where very Orthodox Jews (who do, it is true, practice the Law) now freely confess to belief in a dead Messiah, who will be resurrected, and who, many declare, is "the essence of God in a body".  Moreover, the second-and-third hand derived picture of kabbalah, most particularly the poetical post-Kafkaesque elaboration on the meaning and emotional import of "Yahweh's" zimzum is a debilitatedly reductionist and misleading summation for the reader of the contextual placement and import of zimzum and shvirat keliim within the rich panoply of inter-related Lurianic symbology as understood through its oral and written expositors. Just as Hamlet really is not Yeshua and Bloom's Yahweh is an over-familiarized and sized down version of the theophononic and hieraphantic Yahweh-Adonoi-El of Jewish tradition and practice, so is his Yahweh of zimzum an over angst-compressed shoebox size misimpression of the Divine Structure of actual Lurianic kabbalah 
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 The CD changer would not open to receive the CD's. A call to the Company's customer service resulted in their decision that it must be a manufacture's defect so it was returned to the supplier for a replacement. The replacement is in progress.  Attention from the supplier has been satisfactoty 
 Reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it. For one thing, the author still talks about the USSR and East Germany, and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated. It's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future. 
 This is a real bad version of a Tom Clancy technothriller. The characters are cartoon like, continuity editing is missing and is continuously harping about the evil French. The premise could be interesting, but it is written for an extremely simple minded audience 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 It was like a T.V. movie.  It sort of keeps your attention, but ultimately, it was just a way to kill a few hours.  I thought the Robert character was entirely weird, even creepy.  Who would want a stranger hanging out with your family, day after day, when you're mourning the death of your husband?  
 It is difficult to believe Ms. Aston has read Pride and Prejudice for the simple reason that none of the "daughters" presented in this book could possibly be related to Mr. Darcy.  The names are a dead give away:  Letitia? (who is purely boring); Camilla ??  Traditionally children were named after relatives.  Jane, Elizabeth, Georgiana, Mary, Catherine, Lydia, Charlotte. etc.  But then it is impossible to believe that any of these silly, mannerless, oversexed, vulgar young women could have been brought up by the Darcys.  Camilla grows a little but her love affairs are not believable.  What are we told about Wytton that would make anyone love him?   And then "Aunt Lydia?"  What connection has she to the giddy brainless Lydia who runs away with Wickham?  And Caroline Bingley?  This book has no connection with Jane Austen.  It is a much-too-long badly plotted Regency, who's author has used Mr. Darcy's name as a selling point.  
 I bought this book based on the rating's. Once it arrived i sold it as a used book on amazon within 5 minutes. If you need a book in the bathroom to keep you occupied, or if you want to see 1 or 2 good dog pictures. Then by almeans buy this book. But if you are a serious photographer then pass this on by. The best part about this book was the B&W photo of the pug. Plus i broke even when i resold it 
 The book promises quite a lot, but does not deliver even for a slim volume.  The relative lack of useful content is further complicated by the author's rather cynical prose and obvious lack of joy about collecting.  There are some useful definitions and web site references, but overall you may not want to add this work to your collection.  
 I felt compelled to write this review.  I can't state this more clearly, don't buy this book!  I read the reviews stated here by other readers and the only one that I can forgive is the one written by the 6th grader.  This book is a mess!  Characters are introduced haphazardly and then forgotten.  The pace is confusing and the conflicts are resolved in an almost comical way.  Save your money!!!   
 The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.   Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.   Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.   Jesus wept.   And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.   At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually 
 While I Was Gone, by Sue Miller, reads suspiciously like a blend of the steadily increasing numbers of this genre of WASP apologist novels. To my jaded eyes, these offensively scrupulous tales appear to be written for WASP C Average women college graduates of A plus incomes.  I am certain that many of these readers will consider themselves more well-read and better understood for having consumed a stack of this stuff by similar writers. Somehow, WASPS everywhere will feel that instead of being emotionally constipated and terminally civilized, that they are, as usual, better than everyone else who isn't like them.  The characters, including the animals, are for the most part, good-looking, privileged, educated, and eminently acceptable. Suspension of disbelief is just not happening here. This novel pays some token hommage to the strife of teenage parenting and the shoals of marriage. Yet, it remains smug and self-satisfied conveying beyond a shadow of a doubt that these superior folks are going to soldier on and become even better than they already are for having erred on the side of humanity.  Ugh! Just once it would have been nice to experience a character like Jo screaming at her minister husband Daniel to cease his sadistic sanctimonius silent cruelty and put himself in her place. Alas, no, that sort of low-class behaviour can never exist in the rarified world of the dazzlingly narcissictic humble.  I would exhort Sue Miller to redeem herself by writing about some low-born WASPS who know how to crochet toilet roll covers and make gloppy casseroles while drowning in some decently offensive hypocracy 
 Getting the flashlight is a real problem.  After paying for expedited shipping on Dec 1, meaning Dec 8th -- at the latest -- arrival.  Still waiting on the 17th.

 Neither of the nuclear bombs the US dropped on Japan (not forgeting the earlier fire bombing of Tokyo) were necessary to conclude the war.  Japan was a thoroughly defeated country and had been seeking terms for peace for over half a year.  The terms finally granted by the US were precisely those which Japan had been seeking all along.   Irrespective of this, by the self-proclaimed standards of the United States, Major (later Major General) Sweeney was clearly a war criminal of the worst sort.  It is one thing to attack enemy combatants.  Quite another to burn the eyeballs out of the heads of 100,000 civilian non-combatants.  Many (10,000) of whom were Sweeney's fellow Catholics.    The "I was only obeying orders" excuse didn't work at Nurnburg.  It shouldn't work in America either.    
 As "rush to judgment" is the mantra chanted by defenders of the "presumption of innocence" and skeptics of law enforcement, so could "rush to publish" be a criticism leveled at authors who have penned premature books on the Laci Peterson case.  Fleeman's, "Laci - Inside the Laci Peterson Murder," a pulp paperback mass produced by St. Martin's Press in December of 2003, is an accounting of the case from the "disappearance" Christmas Eve of 2002 to the burial of Laci and Conner in August 2003, two months before the preliminary hearing where many clarifying, enlightening and alarming facts would be presented. Fleeman, currently on the staff of People magazine and formerly with the Associated Press, attempts to portray a fairly balanced treatise, based heavily on articles from The Modesto Bee and press conferences, along with selected quotes and opinions from the Peterson family which have not, to my knowledge, appeared in print before.   From this observation, I conclude that the Peterson family was consulted during the research of this book and were compensated for it. Notably absent are statements from the Rocha side that were not derived from previously broadcast or printed media. Whether because of inaccurate sources, ignorance, careless editing, or deliberate spin, the book contains an extraordinary amount of errors.    I am surprised that a professional such as Fleeman would allow this book to go to press without having someone with an informed background in this case proof read it first. To Mr. Fleeman's credit, interspersed as a sort of bucolic relief between recounting the chronology of the grim investigation, a few of his anecdotes about the history of Modesto are amusing. However, Mr. Fleeman's somewhat bland narrative is eclipsed by quotes from the major players in the story, and what few laughs and tears I experienced reading this book were all elicited by Laci or her family, who remain the heart and soul of this tragedy.  Fleeman's main source of information was obviously local news reports generated daily throughout the case by the Modesto Bee, some of which we now know were incorrect in many of the details, based on the flurry of activity and originally accepting much of Scott Peterson's explanations for events as fact. Various recurring descriptions of Peterson "crying, blubbering, incomprehensible," and "focused on the search for his wife," were no doubt contributed by his family, as any overt demonstrations of grief, credible emotional displays, or participation in active searches were nonexistent to the rest of the world. Fleeman relies on Peterson's timeline and other unreliable references for his activities of the 24th, the weather, the number and times of his phone calls, McKenzie's behavior, and Laci's plans that morning.   In his efforts to present Peterson's side of the story, Fleeman traps the defendant in numerous areas of disbelief.   Similar to the articles in People Magazine about the Petersons, Fleeman blatantly misrepresents the clan as "another blended family. Both his parents had three children from previous marriages and, like the Brady Bunch, this brood somehow formed a family when Lee and Jacqueline Peterson got married...He [Scott] was the baby of the family and the joke among the seven Peterson children - five boys, two girls - was that Scott never had to walk anywhere until he was at least age two..." Apparently Mr. Fleeman isn't privy to the fact that Jacqueline's first two children, Don and Anne, were given up for adoption and never met Scott until they were adults; and that Jacqueline, by all accounts was never married prior to Lee.  Other important (or incriminating) details that were omitted in the book include reports of Scott golfing during the searches, visiting the Berkeley area in rented cars only to stare out at the water for a few minutes and leave; and the revelation that a neighbor, Kim McGregor, was responsible for the burglary of Peterson's house while he was in L.A, which were all common knowledge before the preliminary hearing. Curiously, the 8-page photo archive in the center of the book includes no pictures of Laci, not even the ubiquitous "missing" poster. Any biographical information about Laci is derived from her family and friend's interviews with the press and television personalities. If I were writing a book about a murder, using the victim's name as the title, I would make a concerted effort to flesh out her life and history to portray her as a multi-dimensional person, and not merely rely on what has already been written about her.   The philandering and fraudulent Scott, on the other hand, warranted much more illustration, including several references to a golf scholarship to Arizona State that has yet to be confirmed as anything but Peterson family legend.  Regardless of the attempts to swing the anti-Scott pendulum more toward the center, Fleeman's cozying up to the Petersons is glaringly evident in the amount of ink he devotes to their point of view. Besides his propensity to revisit already trampled territory, the author fails to penetrate any source in the investigation on either side, which may be attributed to the fact that most insiders were strictly adhering to the gag order (despite what the defense and Peterson supporters allege), or just didn't trust Mr. Fleeman. After seeing how Fleeman misrepresented some of the salient details that were shared with him by people peripherally involved in the investigation, I'd be surprised if he gets any more opportunities for future interviews with key players (other than the Petersons) when the results of the trial are known and he wants to write another book. Perhaps he should title his next one "Scott. 
 I missed the book club meeting that discussed this book but thought I would read the book anyway because everyone seems so enamoured with Ms. Cleage.  I read the first 150 pages of this book and I am bored to tears.   All of the reviews call this book astonishing; did the reviewers read the 1st 150 pages--nothing, absolutely NOTHING interesting happens in these pages.  Even if the author made up for it in the last 150 pages, this book could not be an astonishing book.  I will not be reading anymore Cleage books.  I, however, will try to finish reading this one since I started it.  My hopes for some excitement in the book,however, has been shattered by the other reviewers who state that the book doesn't even have excitement at the end of the book 
 Jon Finkel was obviously a very bright boy who grew up heckled and hazed until taking up a trading-card game called Magic: The Gathering.  He initially flunked out of Rutgers, then re-entered and did much better.  After his success transformed Jon into a cool world champion he moved into poker rooms, than a card-counting blackjack team, and finally to the World Series of Poker.  In the process, he cast off his nerdy looks by investing in contacts and nice clothes, and losing about 65 pounds (from 250 to 185).  When we leave Jon at the end of the book he is en route to a $2-3 million winning year.  Little/no drama, and not that interesting.  
 I was trying these as a change of pace from the Turkey Jerky I normally eat.  They taste ok (nothing special), but several of the medallions (in at least 3 bags so far) had 'crunchy' bits in them.  I suspect it was gristle, or possibly small bone fragments.  Not pleasant to eat.    I may have just gotten a bad batch (other than the crunchy bits, I'd give these a 4 star rating) 
 I've been a fan of Bruce Campbell for a long time, ever since seeing Army of Darkness and Brisco County Jr. actually. In the early nineties Bruce Campbell burst on to the scene with an original and fresh personae that was side-clutching, rolling on the floor hilarious at times. I remember being devastated when they stopped producing Brisco County, and then so excited when they announced Jack of All Trades. I didn't get to see the Jack series though as it wasn't carried in my area. I decided to rectify that last month and order the series as a kind of an early Christmas present to myself. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. I am not sure whether I would have found this series funny or entertaining a dozen years ago when it was released, but after watching the first two episodes I just didn't care to watch any more of them. I felt that the half hour format didn't permit any real character development or permit them to write any really interesting plots to build on the Wild, Wild West promise of the show. Or maybe it is just that I am older and my tastes have changed. But, for whatever reason, the show did not grab me at all and I don't see myself wasting any more time watching additional episodes. I love watching Bruce Campbell, but the magic of Brisco County, Jr. just didn't seem to be present in this series. If you are a real Bruce Campbell fan though you might go ahead and give this a try. Just because it fell flat for me doesn't mean it will for you. I think Bruce Campbell is a one-of-a-kind and maybe I just hit this on a bad day. Long live Bruce 
 'Buddhism Without Beliefs' represents, some would argue, a radical existential view of Buddhism:  There is no true reality--only my experience.  If we accept this, Batchelor calls on us to dump rebirth and karma, since we have no experience of them, so that we are faced with an  "existential, therapeutic and liberating agnosticism."  But this is only playing with words.  Batchelor is really marketing a radical acceptance of one's ignorance and suffering which, in effect, turns Buddhism on its head. 
 I am considering opening my own spa and I bought this book based on the publisher's review that it has everything to "build and operate a profitable business". I have an MBA and 10 years of management consulting experience, so for me this book was a collection of the common sense business basics and generalities instead of the spa operations insights. It is definitely not worth its price ($69). For those who are in my shoes, I would suggest to buy one of the business publications available from the ISPA or learn industry trends from www.hfdspa.com and many SPA publications 
 one of the worst Van Damme movies of all time, this one and Derailed and Replicant and Knock Off, come of Van Damme baby, make good ones and have good directors too. this one has Van Damme after Mickey Rourke who Rourke ends up killing him or he thinks he killed him, then Van Damme goes to an island of lost dead agents and villians(corny). he escapes retardedly and then goes back to save his wife and his up and coming child(who Van Damme and Rodman almost indanger the poor kid, bastards). Van Damme gets help from puke and choke Rodman and they have awesome adventures and eat lots of candy, no wait, thats what I was thinking and then, no. but there's some, I SAID SOME, good action, but then it dies and sits there. the end with an oiled up shirtless Rourke and the tiger lets the suspense and action down. strickly for fans of the movies Van Damme was crappy in. this is repuked up snot on a seseame seed bu 
 I don't know how Out of Sight made the New York Times bestseller list when it came out.  This book could have been written by a high schooler.  The plot is nothing to write home about and Elmore's writing style is sub-par.  The book lacks suspense.  I knew (and you will, too) exactly how the book was going to end about 10 pages into it. The book is also lacking in emotion and description.  It reads like this:  Foly said, "..." She said, "..." He said, "..." The she said, "..."  Get the idea? The book is a very easy read that could maybe entertain you for the weekend, but don't expect to be wowed by "the best crime novelist of our time" 
 I got this at Best Buy 4 months ago, its been serviced twice, has a replacement board and there is a 2 month + wait for 2 more replacement boards (digital and scaler).  The picture is lime green, especially on the left side.  The Tech keeps saying all of them (this model) have a green picture so repairs won't work ... so here I sit waiting for repair #3 - by the way, don't get it at Best Buy or use their warranty - its a big battle getting them to replace it or even fix it. FYI This Model wasn't made by Sharp, it was made by a far inferior manufacturer, and the picture shows it.  Anyway, it would be a great set if it wasn't like looking thru Lime Green Jello.    Perhaps the other Aquos models live up to their rep 
 I had read the reviews about this book being a bit disturbing, but decided to give it a try anyway.  My daughter loved the pictures of Carl, but her father decided to ban it, taking it to work to share with his coworkers.  The illustrations are great, and most of the story is cute, but the baby falling two stories in the laundry chute, and falling into the fish tank were not so cute 
 I thought the information in this book was not usefull to me in any way. I was really disapointed 
 I thought this DVD would be fun. It's got a fantastic feature that allows you to customize your workout, but I was really disappointed with the content. It was poorly organized, short, and not very fun. I bought it the day it was released and am already getting rid of it. Don't waste your money. If you want a great workout that's fun, get Carmen Electra's striptease workout. The best are 1 and 2. 
 I have often wondered what would have become of Sandition, Jane Austen's last work had she finished it before her untimely demise.  I heard that several authors have written a completed version of the aforementioned novel.  I decided to pick up Charlotte because Julia Barrett entertained me with her novel called Presumption, a Pride and Prejudice continuation starring Georgiana Darcy.  Ick!  This book is bad, very bad.  Talk about inconsistent!  The eleven chapters that Austen wrote of Sandition (no one is sure if this was the intended title for the novel) center on Charlotte Heywood and her impressions about the town of Sandition during her stay at the Parkers' estate.  There we meet the sort of colorful characters that have become Austen's signature style and their attempts to turn Sandition into a touristy place that would rival Brighton and others.  Austen introduced a few couples and some romantic possibilities between Charlotte and Sidney in narrative and dialogue that are witty, insightful and entertaining.  Then enters Barrett's takeover of the storyline and new characters and situations are introduced that, to be frank, have nothing to do with what Austen had in mind.  This "completion" of Jane Austen's unfinished effort is a disgrace.  The characters' actions are so incongruous to what Austen created in those short eleven chapters that it is offensive to even presume to let the reader think that these alterations belong in a Jane Austen classic or that they are in any way consistent to the aforementioned work.  Charlotte, Lady Denham, Thomas Parker, Sidney Parker, Clara Brereton and Sir Edward Denham show no resemblance to Austen's characterization.  There was a complete overhaul once Barrett takes over.  Thomas Parker is the worst alteration here, in my opinion.  I couldn't believe the character assassination!  The storylines aren't any better.  The whole thing about the gambling and bootlegging is ridiculous!  I have no idea what Austen had intended for the rest of this novel, but I'm sure that she would have never written something so preposterous.  The writing style is rather strange.  Everything seems to be fragmented and we are only shown bits and pieces of the subplots here and there.  It is all very bizarre.  Charlotte is so underdeveloped once Barrett takes over the writing that I'm none the wiser about her by the time the novel ends.  Ugh!  I'd never read a more frustrating attempt at completing an unfinished effort by a beloved author.  I had based my decision to read this on Barrett's Presumption (pun intended).  The aforementioned novel wasn't great, but I thought it was a fair continuation of Pride and Prejudice.  This, however, is just awful.  I have nothing against the author, but she shouldn't have touched this one.  I have purchased Barrett's The Third Sister (continuation of Sense and Sensibility) and might as well give it a whirl.  I only hope that it'll be better than this one.  As for reading any more completions of Sandition, I think I'll give the one written by "Another Lady" a whirl.  For I have heard and read great things about that one 
 After an amazing season 3 culminated in tragically hopeless catastrophe, I had such high hopes for season 4. Episodes 1 - 6 are dark and interesting, but season 7 is the beginning of the downward spiral. None of the characters are likable or interesting after that point.   The story line was leaden. After growing into a self-less champion for good in season 3, Cordelia acts like a depraved moron until she is revealed to be little more than a body suit for a dark force...except it takes *FAR* too many episodes to reveal this. Much of the final 15 episodes are made up by long, boring, circular talks between Cordelia and Connor (yawn). In the words of Buffy: "Alright! I get it - You're evil!" The blah blah Oedipal/Modred weirdness of the whole season is just not appealing or well-written enough to be intellectually stimulating. Would that Cordelia had never come back for season 4, because it's just too awful that her sassy-yet-big-hearted self was nowhere to be found.  Connor and the Cordy-suit have a baby - a goddess figure named Jasmine...who is kind of like a cross between LaFawnda from Napoleon Dynamite and a New Age yoga instructor. A full five episodes are filled with long, dull scenes of people being adoring acolytes of this unimpressive villain. Connor's character doesn't develop...period. Sorry folks, but he doesn't get gone until the final scene of the final episode. In a word, blah.   Some good stuff: The gang releases Angelus for interrogation purposes and he goes postal, of course. It's well-played by Boreanaz and highly entertaining (Oh, and Angel's hair is slightly shorter and darker, which is a nice change). Faith returns for a few episodes, the best of which is Orpheus. Faith and Angelus share flashbacks of Angel's good deeds ("Dude, you just saved a puppy!"), while guest star Willow works to restore Angel's soul and give guidance to floundering Wesley. 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Wil is a two dimensonal character who can't solve any problems for himself. At every challenge, he has to be helped by someone else. I don't see the point of this story, it is a classic good vs. evil story, only made worse by the awful characters and plots. It is very confusing and not worth the time to read. I would give this book 0 stars if I could. If you want a good book, read Harry Potter, or Eragon or something. Just not this series 
 If you like recipes that don't work, sauces that don't thicken, then this is the book for you.  It's a collection of poorly written recipes that I would recommend you don't waste your money on.  If you're serious about Asian cooking, don't waste your time or money with this book 
 I have to wonder at the nepotism of the authors on this book jacket, like Lehane, calling Pelecanos "one of the best crime novelists alive." Maybe it applies to earlier books, but with this as my first exposure to Pelecanos I'm not sure I'll find out. I laugh at this being called noir because he finds current cultural references to spit out. Just listen to these people talk--the most stilted dialogue I can imagine: "What?" said Tracy. "Nothing." "You were staring at me." "Sorry." "I don't know why I mentioned my father." "I don't either. Let's get to work, okay?" This kind of uptight and forced dialogue goes on ad nauseam. Ouch. And Pelecanos obviously needs to fill space, filing whole scenes telling the reader about Pee Wee football, what the offensive play calls mean. Noir should not be stiff, and stiff is what Strange is. Lehane may not be always as current but he is fifty times more hip because he isn't out to prove knowledge of the latest rave club or music group. From the reviews here it appears this guy gets polarized reactions so I still encourage you to read him. But maybe start with a library book, like I did. 
 I don't even know what to say.  How this got such great reviews is beyond me.  And it's not even just that it's so pale in comparison to the Matt Damon/ Jude Law film.  This movie is terrible in and of itself.   First of all there's the cinematography that looks like it belongs on tv, scratch that, on tv in the 80s.   Then Ennio Morricone's score that sounds like a B horror movie.  (And I'd like to state here that Morricone always disappoints I don't understand how he managed to write the haunting score to the Mission, which is surely one of the best in movie history, as every other soundtrack I've heard by him is just [...])  It's better to have no music and than bad music and this movie should have opted for plan B.  I feel that cinematography and music are among most important aspects of movie, not because they make a movie good, but because they can soooooo easily destroy a movie that would be good otherwise.  If these two things are screwed up the only thing that can save the movie is the best script and actors money can buy.  This movie has neither.  I've never seen such over acting outside of a melodrama and as for the script, sometimes I thought it was going for a comedy and missed.  To be honest I can't even imagine Patrica's original novel could have been any good in the first place as the plot is so silly.   At the start I said I don't know what to say and I've said a lot but really I think I could say it best by pointing out the fact the Mystery Science Theater 3000 has often featured better movies than this failure 
 The wheels on the bag lasted less than two months.  The bag is now basically unusable. 
 When I saw this movie, I thought this is a soundtrack I got to have.  I went out and bought it the next day.  It took about 10 minutes for me to realize that I'd made a huge mistake.  The soundtrack is not really a "soundtrack".  I could hardly pick out the songs on the CD as being songs in the movie.  I was really looking forward to the diverse mix of rock and hip-hop that was in the movie, but all that the soundtrack has is Nelly, Nelly, Nelly.  Where's the other cool songs from the movie?  My review is one star because they won't allow less than that 
 I am constantly amazed at what can get published.  The plot of this book requires the reader to suspend any sense of logic and rationality.  In fact, the plot is so far-fetched I thought it was a parody.  The characters are not believable at all.  The reader is supposed to believe that Mozart has been re-incarnated as Frankie.  Um right.  And I am the queen of Spain.  This is the first book by the author that I have read and I am not anxious to pick up another one.  I found the plot lines and character developments to be insultingly stupid.  Almost too embarassed to donate this book.  I pray for the trees sacrificed to make this 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 I watched as much as I could stand on PBS before concluding this was not a classic 19th century novel unknown to me but a poor recent imitation, and came online to verify that.  Anyone who is enjoying watching this has presumably never seen anything based on a really good novel, like those by Dickens, Dumas, or even Wilkie Collins. What ****!  I refuse to waste my time even to see it through to the end.  This is only for people in the current generation raised to observe frequent violence rather than intelligent plot and conversation.  It is not terrible, but not worth watching if you have anything at all worth doinng with your time 
 I have little to add to what's already been said by other reviewers other than I can't believe she seriously holds these views.  I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven.  You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.  She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want.  Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year 
 Elia Kazan performed miracles on stage and screen, but he had the talent behind him or in front of him, namely Brando,Vivian Leigh, James Dean, Julie Harris, Natalie Wood, M. Clift, Lee Remick etc. He butchered Tennesse William's Cat On A Hot Tin Roof's third act, but it worked on the stage, and opened the doors for more buthering in the Elizabeth Taylor film with Paul Newman, directed by Richard Brooks.   Kazan collaborated with Arthur Miller on many projects, and we learn they shared Marilyn Monroe in bed..stated as a matter of course or as a funny sort of arrangement, not to put too fine a point on that novel and film (The Arrangement..Kazan's autobiography, as tasteless as anything he might have arranged with Miller and the unsuspecting Marilyn Monroe.)  Kazan did much to push Hollywood out of the censorship habits of scripting and acting and directing; he brought T. Williams' Baby Doll to the screen, never knowing it came from Chaucer,  with the great Carroll Baker and brought down the wrath of the Roman Cath. Church, not a bad thing to do. He also challenged old screen acting attitudes by placing Raymond Massey and James Dean in long emotional scenes together in East Of Eden, showing Massey's terrible  histrionics and narrow ideas about screen acting , driving Massey crazy. James Dean gave both Massey and Kazan lessons. It is interesting that Massey's performance was never re-done, but lies there , a weird contrast to Dean's greater talents, and Julie Harris' as well. Those dead zones in Kazan's work becoime more freqent as he pushes on into the 50's and 60's.  With Brando Kazan brought out the best to be sure; A Streetcar Named Desire was made into a movie, with that awful ending that Kazan thought was "Ok" again that lack of artistic insight. Furthermore, Kazan never liked Vivien Leigh as Blanche or as anything, which showed a disturbing deficit in Kazan's sensibilites about Tennessee Williams. Kazan never "got" Streetcar" and it shows in the way he tends to make Leigh as Blanche look like a woman afflicted with the disease of poetry,  a loser out for lust, namely Brando, who is irresistible to her. This shows no understanding of the play's subtleties.  The Cat On A Hot Tin Roof stuff is bad, the way Kazan re wrote it, with Big Daddy not returning in Act 3, which ruins the play completely. Thenm there are the put downs of Williams and William Inge too,the latter,  who wrote screenplays for Kazan, one Splendor In The Grass, beautifully written and acted, with the ususal Kazan blind spots: overacting fathers and mothers, like Karl Malden did in any Kazan film, or Andy Griffith in A Face In The Crowd. Kazan films do have scenes that are sheer melodrama, very TV, weakening many of his films. (Parenthetically, in Splendor In The Grass, where we have poetry ,William Wordsworth informing all of it,starting with the title,of course, all the way through the film. But with Kazan's peotic perspective we have cuts and changes that explain the many allusions to Wordsworth'sIntimations Of Immortality, from where the title comes,  the Kazan way,the Cliff Notes way..simplistic and very damaging to the central characters' roles and their final encounters with each other.   Kazan with Blanche in Streetcar, and with Wordsworth in Splendor In the Grass and so on... He never understood the life of the poetic mind beacuse he hadn't the training or talent, and he was therefore unable to cope with a James Dean or a Marlon Brando when they moved away from his reductionist  approach to all art.  Wild River with Montgomery Clift and Lee Remick is very good, and  Kazan could not get the audience to see the film, because he thought of Wild River in terms of receipts, not as classic or unique. And  so he reverted to imitation in Splendor in The Grass, a Rebel W/out a Cause feel to it, having ignored the Wordsworth themes written into it by Inge.    Indeed, an extraordinary career with other films touching , only touching, touchy topics,  such as Pinky, Gentleman's Agreement, Viva Zapata, Sea Of Grass, America America, and that uneven version of The Last Tycoon, with De Niro and Moreau in charge,thank God. (Ironically, De Niro's name in the film and the Fotzgerald novel is Monroe Starr.)Kazan could never shake the refernces to Marilyn Monroe, and by extention Miller. And we come to the worst moment in his career, After The Fall. It ended his success with everyone, and Arthur Miller was through as a successful playwright.(In the 2000nds Miller would approve opf a revival of After The Fall..the same reception ensued..the public still remembers Marilyn Monroe with fondness, great love in fact..Miller, like Kazan, did not see this and a lot more.)After The Fall is about Marilyn Monroe and it is a mean-spirited play about her, thinly disguised as a bitch baby of no importance. Miller thought of Marilyn as only a compositional resource for years, a ticket to fame in films. Butlook at The Misfits, and how Marilyn dominates with Clark Gable the entire film, with the help of Huston's script changes..Marilyn and Gable died after this film and so did Miller's film dreamsw.)In any case, the public in 1964 stayed away in droves from After The Fall, and all of Broadway and Hollywood and the public at large never forgave either of them. Others before Kazan and Miller had trashed Marilyn after her death with the same results: finished in show business.  Tony Curtis learned harsh lessons, as did Tony Randall, and many others, for their remarks about Marilyn's so-called lateness on the sets, and her drinking and drug use. Kazan and Miller thought they were above the low life trashers; they were not and were shunned.  But the worst was On The Waterfront, NOT Brando's performance, but the defense of informing which is what the film is all about. Kazan would have sold out anyone to keep his place in America America in tact; he named people with out a blink of the eye to a group(McCarthy's brownshirts) that could have taken over after Stalin died, and did, in the USA. Even Miller, when called, refused to name names, but Kazan did and he was a bastard to do it. It shows the very large dark spot of commoness in his life and work, a something missing in Kazan's idea of the age, a fatal,  profoundly disappointing stupidity, based on his survival instincts, impulses which places On the Waterfront, the ultimate homage in the age of MCarthy to informers, as art clearly in the service of evil and banality.   He did indeed need stars to get it all going, and other directors need them too, after all, you want talent like James Dean on every film you direct. However, Kazan 's work has the commercial taint to it; always,  there is bad secondary casting; his films preach and talk forever about the need to stand for something; he condemns the immoral, but always esteems the patriotic informer, and for this sensibility  he lost Brando forever for doing this in On The Waterfront. But look at Malden as the priest in this film..endless self-posturing, and self-justification;  and again in Streetcar, acting out Mitch rather than feeling his way around Blanche with his hyprocrisy, as Williams' wrote it.Vivien Leigh fights her way through to the climax of the scene with the lantern covering the light, with Malden reciting lines all over the place, garrulous and meaningless. Again, no poetic sense on Kazan's part, or any clue as to the significance of the scene, that's why Kazan could  so easily compromise on the gay issue here and again, on that absurd ending to the film, Streetcar Named Desire. All this is defensible to be sure, on some rhetorical level,  but there is that spot of commonness, that facist streak of the squeeler that covers Kazan's films with didacticism,an insincere hectoring of the themes of his pictures on racism and anti-smitism, a smallness, a Lilliputian mind esentially,  that tried to usurp Tennessee Williams' plays, trashed V. Leigh's art, thought Brando never did another good film after On The Waterfront (Last Tango In Paris, to name a few), who toyed with Marilyn Monroe , a n icon forever..Kazan never knew she was or could be that, nor did Miller...they thought they were the icons of the age, esp. Kazan, and he was not..noone went to see his very personal America America or his autobiographical pic, The Arrangement. They are self-serving, malicious, and, without Williams around or Inge or Steinbeck, poorly written, as, in America America he wants us to see the greatness of HIS arrival in America. How America is now twice blessed in his arrival, hence perhaps the repetitious title. In The Arrangement..a lurid Deborah Kerr(How could anyone conceive Deborah Kerr as this sort of non person; a career killing perfomanbce by Kirk Douglas, and so on..and the editing..horrible jumps and lurches forward and backward, signifying nothing. Kazan needed great stars, but he needed a script too, and imagination. By this time, the late 60s, his imagination had cancelled itself out, with Kazan's blocked mind about conscience, informing, facism, and Monroe.    But we look to others for greatness in every sense of that word..Huston, Wyler, Lang, Hawkes,and abroad, Kurasowa, Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman,  and a few others. Artists don't shoot other artists to get ahead, to shoot that next film. The low vibrations of such informing acts stick, and eventually produce After The Fall dramas, which make us question all that went before in Kazan's work.   Kazan said once that Gentleman's Agreement did not go far enough, there was a hestiancy in his(Kazan's) drive behind the film. Indeed, a hestiancy with anti-semitic issues, but not a hesitancy about naming in sheer ignorance of Stalin or anybody like him,  8 people who were ruined because of Kazan's stand against their freedom, and his liking of the ways of facism...an easy, evil political ideology that softens all of  his work, makes it luke warm, unspiritual,which it wants so despertely to be, and, except for Brando and all the stars of greatness,makes it a bit nauseating.   
 A sorry science fiction book (not a mystery novel in my judgement) not written by Ludlum but his name is on the cover to sell books (my viewpoint). The book takes advantage of todays terrorist threats and smallpox concerns to stir the readers interests but nothing in the book reflected the writings of Ludlum. I strongly suspect that Ludlum did not even write the outline for this book and the sorriest one, "The Paris Option" 
 I was dismayed to discover Walker's acidic tone towards the Judeo-Christian religious tradition in this book. She seems to think that the fact that many Jewish and Christian symbols happen to have origins in Pagan cultures is somehow discrediting to Christianity and Judaism. In this and in some of her other writings, she makes it clear to the reader that it is her opinion that Judaism and Christianity are nothing more than a bastardized form of pseudo-Paganism in which the role of the woman has been subordinated. Merely because Judaism and Christianity borrow heavily from Pagan tradtions does not mean that they are not valid forms of spirtuality. It is all well and good to be proudly Pagan, but it is entirely unacceptable to denigrate other religions to be so. A true scholar must be strive to be as objective and unbiased as possible in their work, and Walker fails spectacularly in this respect. I do not reccommend this book to anyone, as Walker's blatant bias makes me highly suspicious of her scholarship, and my suspicions seem to be confirmed by other reviewers. 
 This is sad for me because I love her other work. And even though that last couple of books aren't as funny as they were in the beginning, they still have a plot and they make sense. I feel cheated by this series and won't be reading anymore of it.  I called my friends and told them not to read this. The plot is just too stupid, who is going to cut up a couple of NASCAR's and steal a hauler and seriously what guy doesn't have tools in the trunk of his car, even if they are just for show? Then you have a dead guy in plastic wrap and you argue about what god would want you to do with him?  The Cigar/Fruit stand ladies, are not only annoying, all the "secret" staying over is just ridiculous. The autographing was kind of funny in the 1st book but in this one it was over used and stupid. If you're hiding, you hide. In the opening of the book Barney said no body cheats her, and in the end she's sleeping with Sam who did exactly that.   I am tired of media that has women taking back cheaters or worse yet begging for a second chance. Stupid funny isn't for me and a bag of dog poop? Not funny. This book treats us like we are too stupid to care there is nothing but a bunch of slapstick going on, I might as well have watched a 3 stooges episode it would have been more fun.   There were a few times I laughed, the NASCAR stuff was interesting but the rest of it had me calling my mom mid book and asking her to shoot me.  
 The References were very good,I did not think that the entire book, was simply case histories. Perhaps my expectations were to high , overall the book is good 
 Sovereign seems to skip around often in a half-hearted effort at being comprehensive.  The cases are not very recent, despite the publication date, and the book has a definite lack of flow.  It is almost as if the  author threw together several mismatched segments and forgot to edit it for  comprehension and cohesiveness 
 I can't understand anyone giving this movie anything but one star. It stinks. It's a tired and overdone plot with a main character who is very hard to care about. I wanted more of the stray dog story. At least that would have given us more to watch. Even Judd's roommate made a more interesting study. The Lucy/Judd character is just plain boring. She drinks. We get it. Coors light. We get it. Please buy it. She poses and plays pool and gets drunk every night. We get it. She drives too fast and she wears the same clothes every day. We get it. She sleeps around with strangers. We get it. She NEVER combs her freakin' hair. We DON'T get it. She is a most unhappy and unlikeable girl. We got it. I won't get the movie, however. I am actually glad I had a free rental here.   Save your dimes and rent Kiss the Girls. At least that was interesting and you cared about Judd's character. And she combed her hair at least once. Sig 
 Bought this one for Evolution class. It is a horrible excuse for a textbook. Do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student. If the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience, then I would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend University of Washington 
 In all, I think this story could have been written in about ten pages in The New Yorker, or some publication like that. Mr. Sierra simply took too long to get to his point and rambled about topics not relevant to the crux of his book. Because it was originally published in Spanish, part of me wonders how much was lost in the translation. Then again, that would only account for a better read, not a better plot 
 I have always been intrigued by the Arthurian legends and thought that as a woman, I'd enjoy this book.  Boy was I wrong!  Guenevere was a whiny, self-centered woman, whom I would be ashamed to know.  And I was sorely disappointed at the way the Catholic faith was misrepresented as a male-dominated cult 
 This is a book by someone who obviously loves corvids but is unequipped for realizing the task she set herself.  The "fabulous" part of the book deals with old world history in two sentences, spending the rest of the space on folksy retellings of stories from Native American traditions.  The "natural" part of the history is anecdotal, sentimentalized and inadequate.  Other works serve far better for each of this one's stated purposes 
 I've read a number of trading books and have to admit that even the best can be dry and tedious at times, but this is the worst book I've read on trading (or on any subject for that matter). The writing style is convoluted and impossible to follow -- even for someone famliar with the material. A good editor could have reduced the size of this book by half. Alexander Elder's Trading for a Living may be a touch out-of-date, but you will be able to understand the content 
 Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM 
 Professor Pollack, a pioneer of feminist criticism and art history, has written a classic in Vision and Difference.  This new edition has a cover with her surname in bold letters, Pollack, as if playing off her famous name.  An unsturdy introduction adds a page to the length of the book.    After careful study of both editions, one will find no textural additions to this edition.    The title has been changed by juxtaposing words so that the first edition does not appear along side this version. The first edition is titled  Vision and Difference: FEMININITY, FEMINISM and the Histories of Art.  Two words have been switched.  
 I was completely disappointed with this book. It works with tutorials of simple PSD  shape files. I am a newbie at After Effects but I heard so much but how it interacts 100% with Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop that I expected more of that in that book. There is no reference on how to mask Alpha Channels of PSD files or even in depth interaction with Photoshop.  I know that this is a begginers book but at least by the end we could have something more advanced 
 Save your money.  I gave up halfway through and shredded the DVD.  Amanda Peet was great in "Saving Silverman", but she should be mortified by this movie.  "Whipped" was probably written by two fifteen-year-olds on their junior high lunch break.  Absolutely abysmal 
 I love George Strait's music.If you look at my profile you will see that I have rated numerouse other cd's of his and gave them all 5 star. He is my favorite artist, but this cd is just plain bad. 
 Even though the show is on a downfall, hoping to end soon, the cover looks vaguelly familiar. Oh, yes. It looks like Friends. Not only is one of the worst shows trying to look like one of the best shows, it doesn't help to copy artwork from the cover of a friends season DVD set 
 Unfortunately, it has been made abundantly clear that Tommy Nothing Fancy never had FAS, never died, indeed, never existed.  Also, Nasdijj's mother was not pimped out, was not a drunk, and was not Navajo.  It seems that Nasdijj's life, as chronicled here, simply didn't happen.  This book is seemingly full of poignancy, beautiful prose, and maybe even "agonizingly lucid" passages, but it is also apparently devoid of truth.   
 I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice 
 Animals should NEVER receive negative punishment (physical or mental). Why should you, when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does? The use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology (as it is utterly unnecessary) and a need to be sadistic. As a veterinarian and animal lover, I strongly advise against this book 
 Despite the fact that this book has been thoroughly dismissed as the pinacle of victimhood mentality and describes a backlash which never happened, despite many of its observations being demonstratedly shown to be baseless and flat out wrong, it still gets reprinted to produce more angry feminist graduates  whose only skill in life is to whine about their systematic oppression while everyone else gets on with their lives making individual choices about their work and family life.  Will somebody please tell them that their convulted oppressive patriarchy disappeared a long time ago and it is only their own victimhood mentality that prevents them from getting ahead in life.       A book only for the true believers and those taking women's studies.  Totally irrelevant to everyone else who takes personal responsibilty for their own choices in life 
 I've just started to try and read this book as part of my MBA, however the book is of terrible production quality.  The pages are all out of order, and some are falling out as I turn over the pages.  If you have this book mandated as part of a course as I did, you'll just have to live with it, otherwise choose another book that you don't have to hop around in just to get the pages in order 
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 Only 38 pages into this book, I've had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is.   From the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the AAP's "neutral" view on circumcision, this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone.   Thankfully, I got this from the library. All I have to do is return it and try and forget the bad, bad information it provided.   Keep looking 
 Having really enjoyed Happiest Baby on the Block, I thought this book would be helpful too. I was so turned off by it, I couldn't even finish reading. Dr. Karp is pushing evolution in explaining why toddlers behave the way the do. I just couldn't take it anymore. 
 Movie Boring... Story Drags... barely any action... if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing... booo 
 So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.  Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.  I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack 
 Alan Deutschman writes in quintessential GQ style...Apple, Pixar, Next and Jobs are given the cinematic attention - Brioni suits and designer clothing take precedence to the story telling theme! That's precisely where the story ends - Neither Apple's business environment nor the facts behind Jobs renaissance garner attention! Steve's vendetta against the Apple board that sacked him, his bitterness about moving away from the company he helped create and his pre-occupation with Odwalla fruit juices/Black polo shirt & blue jeans are the only facets of Steve's character that Deutschman manages to grasp. (...) Steve's obsession with German design aesthetics, his "tomfoolery" with his corporate hobbies- Next, Pixar and Apple are all touted by Deuschman as tenets of a precipitous corporate personality! Jobs is portayed as a whip slashing mogul who just rides his "ill-deserved" luck to the top- He is credited with ZERO intelligence and a disgusting atttitude! Apparently, Next and Pixar had no strategies and were "bleeding,hemorrhaging corporations"- a phrase Deutschman uses with irritating regularity!  Job's groundbreaking strategies to rev up the motorcade of new products at Apple and Next are promptly thrown out of the window! His ability to turn small-door companies like Pixar into money making machines is rudely ignored. (...)This man hardly knows what he is talking about 
 Stay away from these devices!  I bought 6 of them and 3 of them are already having problems, 1 unit alone has logged over 92 errors and I can't get imation to DO ANYTHING about it. They come with a 1 year warranty, you MUST email them for support.  I have emailed 20 times with no response.  If you call the IMATION HQ in Missouri, they will NOT accept support calls for this product, you MUST go though the email / website, so in my option I wasted over $600 on this product, it ain't worth $10.. 
 Well, I had it coming... After being told, after experiencing the disappointment of most titles from this pseudo terror series, I still went and bought this thing. Some other guys have already told the story, so, just know that there is nothing relevant, nor scary, nor original in this -so called- film. David Schow (I actually bought the DVD because of him -screenwriter of The Crow and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the beginning, and author of many, many great short stories) even repeats himself -lines from Bad Guy Hats, from THe Kill Riff, etc-. However, it is the uneventful, terribly chosen and misguided casting, and their soap-opera-like acting, as well as the dull and lazy, and way uninspired direction, that make this film so painfully bad, and boring, and predictable. Larry Cohen has never been an original or even adequate director (let's not say scary, I mean, see his filmography), but since Schow's name was attached to this... well. Don't bother, watch the worst chapter of The Hitchhiker, watch The Hitcher again, watch Invader Zim, anything is better and scarier than this waste of time 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 This book consists of mostly fluff such as a outdated graphic design glossary, and not nearly enough information about actually selling. The worst part is that the author refers to the internet as cyberspace. :( 
 Stephen King should stick to the printed word as every movie he's ever directed has run the gamut of mediocre to poor. The Shining falls into the mediocre pile fortunately, I guess. I know King was very critical of Stanley Kubrick's 1980 movie and so decided to redo the story to be more faithful to the book. Big mistake. Some people should write and others make movies. It's a rare individual who can do both and Steve-o isn't one of them.   This King directed mini-series has many flaws. Not least of which is the wildley inapropriate casting and bad acting. Rebecca DeMornay is tolerable as Wendy but nowhere near as powerful as Shelly Duval's Wendy from the original Kubrick movie. Duval made Wendy a bewildered character who discovers an inner strength she didn't know she had. Her Wendy experienced growth, Demornay reads her lines well. Stephen Weber as Jack is just too slight an actor to pull off the role, he's no Jack Nicholson. I kept thinking of that stupid comedy he was in about pilots on Nantucket or Martha's Vinyard, whatever. His descent into madness is indicated more by the amount of gorey makeup than character development. He doesn't have the gravitas, the presence when compared to Jack Nicholson. To be fair though he has a good scene near the end of the movie when he temporarily throws off the influence of the Overlook, but its too little too late. The worst however is the insufferable brat who plays Danny. He's so scrumdidlyumpciously cute, lisping his lines in a baby voice that to me was like nails on a blackboard. I just wanted Jack to smash his brains out with the crocket mallet and end the torture of having to listen to him whine, and he's supposed to be the sympathetic character? Few actors have made my skin crawl like this kid.   I did like the fact that the movie remains faithful to the book, but by slavishly following the book the flaws in King's narrative devices are brought into glaring relief. Some things work better on paper than translated to the screen. Kubrick, by elliminating the more supernatural happenings made a much creepier and scary movie whose tension slowly grows to a huge climax. The original movie concentrated more on the psychological tension within the characters thus making Jack's descent into madness that much scarier. King's version is much more of a typical haunted house tale that looks and feels cheesy. The ghostly inhabitants of the Overlook hotel look like rejects from a second rate zombie movie with their white pancake makeup and the effects aren't very special. The topiary animals are especially poor. The atmosphere and sense of isolation and ever mounting tension that made Stanley Kubrick's Shining a masterpiece of horror are largely absent in the miniseries. The pacing drags and it's just not very scary. Which as it's supposed to be a horror film, is a huge detriment. Overall the movie isn't horrible, it's worth one viewing, hence my title. But I much prefer Kubrick's bleak and very personal vision than Kings. I'm afraid that King should stick to writing and let masters like Kubrick make the movies even if they're unfaithful to the original material. So rent this movie if you're curious because I'm in doubt you'd want to see it more than once. I know I don't 
 I first came across the subject of remote viewing one night as I was switching tv channels and found a show about "psychic spying".  Imagine my shock when they showed a picture of my own company, SRI International! I've always been interested in anything exploring psychic phenomena, but to learn that this type of research was started at my own company in the '80s was exciting stuff indeed.    The next day at work I learned there were still people here who remembered this program and the scientist who started it, Hal Putoff (not sure of last name spelling).  Some of my coworkers said at the time (of the project's heyday) they experimented with lots of employees, sometimes they'd put a bunch of regular folk in a giant room and give them coordinates to see if anyone could "view" them. Needless to say, scientists are a hard crowd and many found it amusing if not silly.  Physicists I know who worked with Dr. Putoff said the army eventually took over the project. This is told in the documentary I mentioned above. Dr. Putoff was also interviewed in the tv show and so were many others including some of the remote viewers.  So I was thrilled when this book, "Psychic Warrior" was published.  I had hoped it would have tons of more information about what the project was doing now. But then I read it, and was utterly disappointed.  Like "Linus" the reviewer above I think this book was poorly written and the author is completely full of himself.  His constant grandstanding and egomania makes this very hard to get though to the interesting parts about the actual remote viewing.    Also I wonder about how someone can work on a top secret project and then write a tell-all book about it.  Perhaps the author made a deal to embellish certain parts of his story so it wouldn't be taken too seriously.  Either way, if you think you can wade through all the boring garbage about his home life and how great he is, you might possiblly learn a little.  But I can't recommend this book as a tool to help you get there 
 Rising Sun was a terrible read.  Crichton uses one device throughout:  the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him.  It's tiring and monotonous.  Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures. 
 The book "Medicine River" is awash with too many characters and no true plot on which to base the complexities that surround most of these characters. There is too much happening and not enough book to cover it, or enough words to explain it all, which makes the story come across as choppy and irrational. If someone is going to write a novel with over 30 characters, than please, write a trilogy - please don't jam a bunch of nonsensical blather into only 261 pages. Not to mention, many of the scenes leave you feeling as though you've missed something - the human and lifelike qualities that any developed characters should have in a novel. It leaves this book dull and devoid of any true feeling. Although there is a main insight into the book upon how a community can become family over a biological family that one may not possess, this book leaves you feeling like you really have read a fictitious novel, which I don't think was the intention the author had. Too bad 
 This was the cheapest and worst product that I have ever bought at Amazon. This is dollar store junk that is not worthy of being included on Amazon.  Don't fall for the looks online.  The guns are cheap plastic that is literally what you would find in any dollar store, so this package is worth 2 bucks max (since it has two guns).  To top it off, the shipping was screwed up so the "Santa" gift did not show up until Dec. 26.  It sat for 4 days at one station with UPS.  When I tried to call for customer assistance, I ended up in the phillipines....like they would care that my kid wasn't going to have a gun set on christmas morning.  Thanks for nothing Amazon, and the cheap child labor company who over sells this garbage product on your website.  
 My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie 
 Ackroyd is a bad scholar, a bad thinker and a bad stylist.  He should never have attempted a biography of Shakespeare.  The best and kindest thing one can do to this rubbish is not read it 
 I was expecting to hear some extremely original and great music, but this definitely misses the mark.  This is an artist trying to sound like other artists, SRV, John Mellencamp, etc.  If you were to hear this music you would know its wasn't the artists he is trying to sound like, and probably wouldn't want to hear repeatedly.  His voice is fairly weak and indistinct and his guitar is so muddied it is hard to tell what he is trying to achieve.  He might be fun to see at your local pub on a Saturday night, but if you like good rock and good blues, buy something by SRV, Eric Clapton, or Gary Moore.  I thought this was going to be a revelation, but the only thing it revealed; listen to Johnny Lang for better vocals, guitar, and arrangements; for a young up and comer.  This CD is going back to the store for an exchange or trade, but it won't be spinning in the player 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 "The exploitation of grief by those who pretend to talk to the dead breaks my heart."  Pen 
 I read a 200 page allegory to learn what was summarized in the last 25 pages.  There is not much substance here and not much to indicate whether the method described in the book is proven.  
 Yes, I agree with all the comments about this book being very smug about non-breast feeding or formula-supplamenting mothers. My problem with this book was the very clear indication on the back cover that there was information on how to increase milk supply. The was absolutely NO such information ANYWHERE in this book, and I read it cover to cover. The closest thing I found were a few reassuring comments that as long as your baby is gaining weight, and your diet is good, you should be fine. As a working mom who is pumping daily I have recently noticed a decline in my milk, and while their reassurance is very nice, what I need is ACTUAL practical advice. This book was seriously irritating 
 It wasnt all that bad. It had its moments. Brad Renfro (Bully), Dominique Swain (Face/Off), Keram Malicki-Sanchez (tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Emily Bergl (The Rage: Carrie 2), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), James King (Bulletproof Monk) and Jordan Bridges (Mona Lisa Smile, son of Jeff Bridges) star as camp counslers who have, well a lot of problems. Peter Stormare (Eight Millimeter) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp. Emotions, relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way. James King (former model) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm. Renfro and Swain are so wrong for each other, they should be a couple in real life. Bergl is hot to the bone. Bridges is a bastard. Long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and Sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others. Stomare is just weird, plain weird and the kids are brats. So if you liked Heathers, because Daniel Waters wrote it, then this is the movie for yo 
 Can't give a review on Maximum PC.  Never received the magazine.  Instead I was sent the men's magazine FHM.  Please send my Maximum PC 
 "Death Penalty....Eh"  Spare yourself reading this book, because well, the above phrase is its basic premise. The book bills itself as an unbiased look at the death penalty by a lawyer with first hand experience, when in reality it reads like a brainstorm of ideas without a conclusive stance by an author who appears to be writing for the purpose of fulfilling some contractual obligation. Let me summarize that: THIS BOOK IS POINTLESS.  First of its 166 pages, only a hundred or so of it is the actual book. An entire third of the book is the transcript of an unreadable report given to Governor Ryan of Illinois. That would be like writing a book on Sept. 11 but then including the 9/11 report as filler for the back half. Don't forget that every third paragraph seems to mention the fact that the man helped write the report either.  Speaking of George Ryan, the man is revered by the author of this book, despite the fact that he was basically run out of office due to his scandal plagued term of office. I'm not saying that being part of a scandal voids every ounce of your credibility, but to be lectured on this man's moral achievements is like hearing about President Clinton's contribution to the re-strengthening of public trust in governmental office.  But let's get to the actual writing itself. You won't learn a thing reading this book. Why? Because it lacks decisiveness and clarity. "I disagree with using the death penalty as revenge; however, I don't agree that the death penalty itself is innately vengeful" Yeah, well thanks for clearing things up. One chapter supports capital punishment, while the subsequent following three work to disparage District Attorneys and Judges who use it.  Basically, the book ends without contributing a single thing to the death penalty debate. It is, at best, a summary of arguments for both sides without any original analysis of either. The only saving grace of the book is, in fact, its shortness in length. If it were much longer, you would no doubt bill the author for wasting your time 
 Don't get me wrong.I enjoyed watching Robo-Cop.I've seen it more than once,and if I had nothing better to do on a weekday night with friends,I would probably watch it again. That being said;this is not a timeless classic which deserves to be a Criterion Collection Standard. This movie should only last as long as popular,topical entertainment value films inevitably do. There is nothing ground-breaking here,nothing particularly interesting cinemagraphically,just a C+ to B average piece of entertainment. When held against the stature of Verhoeven's 4th Man,(Robert Englund's favorite horror movie),and Soldier of Orange,this film even takes a HUGE step down from entertaining,to a personal embarrassment for Paul! 
 The best thing you could do for yourself is don't subject yourself to reading this adolescent book.  If buying just a small thing from Tiffany's and using the shopping bag as a planter gives you a thrill, then this is for you.  Not me!  Sorry 
 I really loved The Fall of a Sparrow and greatly looked forward to another beautiful novel by the same author.  Unfortunately this one fell apart about halfway through.  Unlike the characters in The Fall of a Sparrow, too many of the characters in this book didn't sound or feel like real people, especially the grown-up Cory.  The girl who painted an obscenity on the Appleton water tower was an intriguing character of few words seen mostly through the adoring eyes of the book's narrator:  the grown-up woman just never took life on the page, despite the many long conversations in which she took part.  The story of an American white boy's attraction to a black girl and his (surely realated) lifelong devotion to black music could have been a fascinating and far-reaching one: unfortunately this time the author fails to bring any satisfying insight to the subject 
 Heavy machine, looked durable, almost commercial. Put her together and began. Within 5 MINUTES of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated! Returned it the following day and bought a Bissel that has worked great, was cheaper and weighs less! 
 I have had the same problems everyone else has described. After only two uses, the threads on the mug's lid were stripped 
 I was really looking forward to this book.  A book that discusses the aspects of each of the congregations in the US or world is a great reference tool in understanding what others believe.  Is this book the one to choose for that purpose?  First, I will discuss its contents, pros and cons before giving my final opinion.  Rhodes' book begins with a very short history of the church (4 pages).  He then defines 'denomination,' 'protestant' and gives a description of how to use the book.  The books covers the following churches: Adventists Baptists Brethren Catholic Christian Congregational Episcopalian and Anglican Friends (Quaker) Fundamentalist and Bible Holiness Lutheran Mennonite Methodist Orthodox Pentecostal Presbyterian Reformed  With each congregation, Rhodes begins with a date of origin for the church, census of members and number of congregations.  He then describes their beliefs and gives a chart of fast facts for the church.  There are several added "fast fact" charts that detail theologies such as Calvinist and Arminian.  Each congregation gets 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 pages (except the Roman Catholic Church where 10 pages are written.)  Some congregations have a robust history leading into discussion of the divisions within, such as the Orthodox church.  Pros: --A large swath of churches is covered.   --A good index aids in finding churches.  For instance, I wanted to find out what the Nazarene church was like, and the index pointed me to the Holiness section, which I was not aware they were part of. --There is an index of persons that helps in determining which authors are from which church. --Rhodes speaks from an unbiased viewpoint.  One could not tell he is conservative dispensational Protestant from this writing.  Cons: --Rhodes left out a couple of churches I have wanted to learn about in my town, namely Unitarian.  Granted, many do not consider the Unitarian church to be strictly Christian, but it is a prominent congregation that would be helpful to have in the book. --The book is VERY vague about church beliefs.  Many of the churches described deny the inerrancy of Scripture, but that can not be determined by the wording used, as the writing makes little distinction between those that call the Scriptures inerrant and those that do not.  One must read between the lines or have some knowledge of the church to discern Rhodes' writing.  Views of Scripture is only one of the vagueries, but is the most prominent. --The book does NOT discuss the issues that set the churches apart.  Worship is spoken about, again, in vague terms.  Is Christ present in the Eucharist of the Lutheran churches?  One cannot tell from this book.  (Some Lutheran churches do teach this and some don't.)  Which churches put high focus on speaking in tongues?  One cannot tell from this book.  My greatest critique is vagueness.  Granted, Rhodes could not have been very specific without relying on some theological bias.  But, more specifics could be told.  From this book, it is very hard to tell why there are divisions.  What divides the American Baptists from the Southern Baptists?  Episcopalian from Anglican?  Greek Orthodox from Orthodox Church in America?  Volumes could be written, but little of it could be found out in this writing.     Is this book the one to choose for the purpose of understanding other congregations?  I have to give a resounding no.  The breadth of this book is a blessing and a curse.  He doesn't leave many out, but the book would have to be much longer to give any insight into the differences between the congregations discussed 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 This book was as much the author's opinion and imagination as anything else. He makes claims that are not substiantiated by facts, biblical or otherwise. I will not purchase further books by this author 
 Sorry, Ms Hunter, but you really messed up on this one; not so much the storyline, but with the characters Anna and Morvan.  You made Anna a very strong woman then turned her into a blithering fool when we were introduced to Morvan.  This guy was awful, so unlike the other magnificant heros.  I don't even know how to describe how much I disliked this guy and everything he stood for-which wasn't much.  But he lacked honor, respect and character 
 Bill O'Reilly ought to stick to what he does best, i.e. making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon 
 Having read and enjoyed Dillard's Holy the Firm to some degree I thought this book might be a tremedous read. After all she's much older and more wise, right? This is probably true. Dillard is an intelligent person. Unfortunately, the book does not (for me) suggest much progress in her approach to the world.   Perhaps a contrast of writers would be helpful. I have come to view writers like Wendell Berry, Scott Russell Sanders and Annie Dillard (and others, like Barbara Kingsolver) as part of a loose band of grassroots theology. For example, Wendell Berry consistantly asks us throughout his works, be it in poems, essays or fiction, to reassess the world as part of a vast Creation, as a God-gifted place worthy of care, to which we are inextricably connected. He asks difficult, extended questions and he also offers us intelligent prescriptions based on deep rooted cultural traditions and religious wisdom, primarily Christian. He shows an opinion.  Sanders moves down similar lines adding quasi-Christian confessional elements. There is clearly a clashing of ideas in Sanders writing that leaves him with many unanswered questions, but he goes after them with an intense curiosity. Unlike Berry, he lacks the roots to hold his thoughts in place and is far more reserved (perhaps deferential) in sharing advice.  Holy the Firm and For the Time Being are strongly confessional and are filled with questions. Annie Dillard is clearly an intelligent woman. She is desiring but lacking the sturdy life of roots leaving her thoughts floating in a hard to define (mystical?) language. Like Wendell Berry she is a Christian (Catholic) seeking answers.  At any rate, both of the books mentioned left me uneasy. Holy the Firm has startling persuasive poetic prose. For the Time being does not. The latter is far more dry and confused in its content. Questions are raised about why the seemingly Created world is filled with birth defects, for example, but she never pursues the reasoning. Such perceptions are simply not unique to most of us and disappointingly they lack the poetic qualities necessary to stand alone as an unanswered thought. It seems odd, but she appears to be disturbed at the possibility of emotionally and spiritually involving herself (her thoughts) in this book. It comes across as an uncohesive descriptive journal. But as I said, she lacks the poetry to pull it off. Random thoughts sit alone with the clash of ideas never really taking shape.  To her credit however this book is searching - as her books always seems to be - for an appreciation for the simple God-given (and taken) things in the world. But after decades of writing I suppose I expected Dillard to offer more rooted thinking. She has not changed much since Holy the Firm.   If you're eager to read about simplicity and the sublime; If you're looking for the tradition and wisdom of roots; I suggest reading Holy the Firm, then picking up a writer like Wendell Berry. This may seem too dismissive but there are more well written and enjoyable books seeking out the things Dillard is seeking in For the Time Being.  
 This book is a collection of 670 illustrations. No text is included with the illustrations, but  could be a good resource for someone interested in seeing the various types of design used in what was mainly cast iron.  The  books groups the ironwork into handrails, window balconies, railings.  banisters, drapery screens and door panels etc. For someone looking for a  copyright free set of graphics this would be a good choice. For those  interested in finding out how this ironwork was made and by who it would be  a bad choice. These is no explanation of who, when or how in this book -  just a collection of detailed illustrations 
 This movie is more dark comedy and trippy foreign bizarrovision film than dyed-in-the-wool Zombie Fest.     If you were like me, who isn't well versed in the foreign horror movie scene, this movie was entertaining, but not what I'd consider something I'd add to the library (thanks NetFlix).  One thing I've found with Italian horror movies.....they spend alot of effort on visual trippery, seems they want every Italian movie to be an art film, and this is no exception (same goes for the Argento films of the past).  Its not a bad thing, just a distinctive style that you either buy into, or you do not.  An awful lot of strange things happen for no real apparrant reason :)  A little bit of sex (again, in that erotic italian artsy style), a bumbling mentally retarded sidekick, and a whole lot of strange, implausable things happening.  And then eventually, the movie ends.  The story is definately more love story / dark comedy..its entertaining, has a few minutes of zombie suspense but its almost wrong to call this a horror film, because its really not.    
 This movie turned me off with its focus on Nash's schizophrenia rather than his monumental achievements. Three-fourths of the movie turns out to be Nash's delusion. I felt like a voyeur, entertained by someone else's pain.  At the end, I wasn't even certain of exactly what it was that Nash had developed....just that he was a brilliant mathematician and severely ill. The barbaric "medical treatment" of the 1950s left me feeling sick.   A documentary would have been far more entertaining. Nash is a brilliant man despite, not because of, his illness, and I found this movie (especially since much of it is fictionalized) to be exploitive. Only two stars 
 My 12 month daughter was not attracted to this book, it's too short and there isn't enough of a story.  There are much better books out there that will keep a child's attention 
 I just bought the Live In Atlanta DVD and both me and my friend agreed that this was the worse album they have put out.  It's to pop and I agree with All Star,  I like pop but not like this *confused*.   It's pretty safe to say TWOTW was their best album!  Even Destiny's Fullfilled was better than this and that had all slow songs.  I don't know what else to say other than this album just has singles on it.  They are not consistent at all,  and the album is just to damn choppy for me.       So, in other word it's horrible.  Buy their first CD, TWOTW and Destiny's Fullfilled instead.  Even the XMAS CD.  Peace,  Kmec 
 I didn't even use this coffemaker.  The apple color was so ugly (reminded me of the avocado in kitchens of the '50's & 60's) and the pot was so heavy & clunky, I decided to donate this to a charity.  I read the other reviews & everyone loved the color in their kitchen.  Maybe another color would be better but I will not try 
 If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his "Official Religious Disclaimer" at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading 
 I, Jedi is amazing. Amazingly BORING!   You've got a first person narrator, which in the all-action-little-depth conceit of the SW novels is a Really Bad Idea. And this isn't even a deep Star Wars charecter. He loves his wife, he tries hard at school, he Never Ever does something he knows is wrong.   The plot slouches along, with narrator-Jedi on a quest to find his wife who doesn't even really get kidnapped proper, just sorta misplaced and sleepy. He then farts around the Jedi Academy for a while (despite not being in the Jedi Academy books) because: hey! wouldn't it be easier to find her if I was a Jedi? This is the central conflict of the novel, a challenge that should be familiar to anyone who played Super Mario Brothers.    Eventually, he goes off to find whatever it was he was looking for, and discovers a whole new plot conflict about 150 pages from the end that has no relationship with the previous anything. So, basicly you're slugging through a miserable 400-page diary to get to an OK novella, which then ends abruptly. After all the excess chaff you put up with, it doesn't even tie up loose ends or explore the few interesting ideas introduced in the last 20 pages.  I honestly don't remember if he saved the princess, but I assume he did, because if he didn't... that would be awesome. In the end, it didn't really matter. This was sooooo bad. I can't believe how bad it was. So BAD! BAAAAD!  
 The opening 30 minutes of this movie is pretty interesting. It reveals the Nazi struggle to launch the V-1 rocket and the British effort to figure out what the Germans are up to. The story of Hanna Reitsch, a top FEMALE Nazi test pilot is a movie in of itself. Her scenes are very good. Also Paul Henreid of 'Casablanca' fame (Victor Lazlo)  plays a Nazi General. It is interesting to see him 23 years after Casablanca. But then, the great wooden actor George Peppard makes his appearance. You talk about a movie losing steam, it loses steam quicker than a tea kettle taken off a hot stove. The plot then becomes dreary and dreadful and predictable, and it becomes for me a '0' star film. The incredibly sexy Sophia Loren is in the movie, but they have her dressed in a dark blue TURTLENECK sweater!! You can't even see her beautiful body. What a waste. She was married to the Producer so I guess she worked cheap. At several points in this epic they use black & white WWII STOCK footage (its a color movie), its laughable, as is most of the acting. 
 Not only is his score recycled, (watch Enemy at the Gates... you'll hear it) it's painfully out of place in this film.  The entrance to the city of Troy is especially dreadful.  I remember watching Troy, seeing the wonderful enterance of Hector, Paris and Helen and thinking, "Did someone just step in an orchestra?"  Scales, followed by overpowering misplaced notes, repeditive, a disaster.  It makes me want to pay John Williams to try and at least make a score that fits the film, because I believe this movie drags as much as it does because of its horrid score... which is too bad, because it could've been a great one.  Too bad I had to give it one star just to say this 
 I read approximately 75% of this book while waiting for a delayed flight in middle America. It is quite simple to sum up: take 100 people who are not employed by Fox News, have ever opposed George Bush, or who have ever taken a political stance that is anything aside from right-wing conservative, and call those people traitors or anti-American.  If you oppose the decisions of the leaders of this country, does this mean you are automatically undermining the social fabric of America? Not in the very least. In fact, many of these 100 people are helping to steer this country away from the downward spiral the US is currently caught in with this dismal administration. Any book with such a title that does not have George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, Condoleeza Rice, and Ann Coulter in the top five is simply an embarrassment to journalism.  Who is this book for? Well, plenty of right-wing conservative folks still think that President Bush is doing an excellent job, we are winning the war on terror, and the country is safer. These are the type of people who need this book. It will make you feel better about the fact that you blindly swallow the bull that is fed to you by the murderers you voted for.  In addition, if you tend to lean left, you should read this book at a library so you can get more enraged at how unintelligent your fellow countrymen can be. But be sure not to pay for it. Don't further line this man's pockets, instead donate the money you would have paid for it to Katrina victims 
 Nothing new, and no new information in this book. It's basically just common sense stuff that most women know already. There was nothing earth shattering - and it's also kind of disjointed on topics (ie- chapter is about "x" and then they bring in letters from women that are totally unrelated. It's a waste of money 
 Not much there,some good ideas but really only a few chapters worth of materia 
 If you have never read a diet book before than this one is as good as any.  The author addresses all aspects of dieting and exercise.  My disappointment was that you have heard it all before.  I have had success on Weight Watchers, Body For Life and the South Beach Diet.  My problem is that after the initial excitement wears off, I don't maintain the program.  I was interested in this book because the other reviews indicated that it addressed emotional aspects of over-eating.  Specifically, boredom, stress, etc.  But I was really disappointed when he discussed these issues because he wrote a little blurb on each aspect and then gave some personal story.  To me it was childish psychological advice.  For example, he discusses binge eating.  Now I am only about 10-15 pounds overweight and I can eat properly all day and then right before I go to bed ruin my diet and eat 3 doughnuts or some other high caloric food.  His belief is that it is often related to some childhood trauma and that seeking professional help may be the answer.  I dont know about you but I am not going to seek professional help to lose 15 pounds.  Then he suggests to eat wisely.  He has a chart that actually says if you want to eat fudge, then choose fruit.  If you want cake, choose skinless grilled chicken breast.  Duh?  I did not make that up.  Here's another one.  If you want to eat pie, then choose soup.  Is he kidding?  I guarantee that I will never eat chicken breast instead of accepting a piece of birthday cake.  Okay I don't want to just bash the book.  Everything he writes is probably dietetically correct.  It's just that I have read them all and done most of them and I have yet to experience one that worked long-term.  The one that I had the most success is Body For Life of which I lost 40 pounds and as I mentioned I have put back 10 to 15.  Good luck.  Nothing new to report 
 The Rise of the Network Society was on my reading list for school -- and I was looking forward to reading it, not only in the context of my class, but because the subject is an important one, especially regarding the  distribution of information and knowledge in our society.  Unfortunately, I  was soon disappointed to find that Castells, with all his remarkable  insight into the arts of communication, has not been able to go beyond the  oh-so cumbersome turns of phrase typical of academic writing. I find myself  turned off by the lingo, where I am truly interested in the subject; I  resent having to plow my way through his phraseology, while I certainly do  appreciate the research and energy he has invested in his work.  There  seems to be an ideal to academic writing that somewhat opposes the general  trend of having knowledge and information made accessible to everyone. Or  is it that Castells really means to restrict his writing (and being read)  to the groves of Academe? If proving himself versed in the field is more  important than getting the information out there, what does he have to  teach us about the implications of a network society? That we should better  cling to our own in-group, to only those who speak our language, whatever  that is? If that is so, what change can we expect from being related  through networks?  If Castells intends to put into practice his belief that  *observing, analyzing, and theorizing is a way of helping to build a  different, better world* (p. 4), then he might as well start with  generously offering his insights to the world he wants to see changed 
 When I first wrote a review for this movie I will confess that I was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell, but upon further review I must take back my previous opinion, and say that though Doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie. I believe that if the movie had been more original then I would have liked it (except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original). Overall as much as I hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching (yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth) so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall.                                SORRY ABOUT MY FIRST REVIEW 
 Wow, talk about an insult to intelligence.  When you read this book you say "Duh" as you read it.  The online quizes coulde be helpful, but using a character called "Answer Man" makes you feel like you are in first grade.  If you really feel you need help with your writing skills, don't get this book.  Try something else, anything else, but this book 
 A friend loaned me this book.  She liked it.  Because she liked it, I slogged through the entire [..] thing.  It may be one of her first books, but it is most assuredly the LAST book by LKH I will ever read.  It is slow, poorly written, and leaves so many loose ends dangling you would think an afghan got caught in a tornado.  The only redeeming quaility this book can [..], as near as I can tell, is that LKH hasn't yet had time to [..] out the female lead. (Ala Anita Black, paranormal [.. 
 So, a bunch of mafia gangsters come over and shoot each other up, then they go out west and shoot each other up there, including one particular scene in which a bunch of people all get shot up together as part of a sort of montage. Woo hoo. How brilliant. I'll never forget this movie. NOT. 
 Buy Nick Mason's "Inside Out" biographical book instead. Much better - great photos & the real story. This one's a snoozer 
 "The gnomic interiority of its lyrics invites the type of deep exegesis usually reserved for..." is not a really atypical sentence opening in Hultkrans' book. If you like "Love" and this sort of writing, you will really like this book. Otherwise, you may be better off reading the book on the group by Love's 3rd drummer, Michael Stuart-Ware 
 I didn't have high expectations for this movie, yet it still managed to completely disappoint me.  I adore Robin Williams, and his performance was the best part of the movie.  But the script was abysmal and Sara, played by Marcia Gay Harden, was a completely one dimensional character.  The antics of the sidekick robot and the "flubber" itself were just plain embarrasing to watch.  Too bad, because the idea is great - but frankly, the original was pretty bad too. They really could have done so much with this story either the first OR the second time around 
 What an overpriced disappointment. All I taste is excess sweetness from Stevia.  Why are almost all green formulas sweetened?  Either you want the greens or not, but don't change the taste with a sweetener.  It's also loaded with Lecithin, an inexpensive soy by-product used as a filler and promoted as something good.... it's not.  The only greens formula I know without sweeteners and fillers is Garden of Life Perfect Food, the Original Formula. Better yet, make your own green powders from Barley or Wheat grass, Chlorella, Spirulina, and Alfalfa powder from NOW Foods . 
 I purchased this book and McFadden's follow-up on Scotland (which I haven't yet read) based on the local newspaper's Travel section recommendation of the Scottish title.  If the book on Scotland is much like the one on Ireland I'm not looking forward to reading it.  McFadden spends  too much of his narrative observing himself and his unexpected travelling  companion, the impulsive Spanish chambermaid/photographer/poet Lourdes  Brasil, then he does the people and landscapes of Ireland.  I grew tired of  his self-congratulatory asides that Lourdes was gaining admiring glances  from the Irish.  I wanted to know more, to SEE more about the land he was  travelling through and the people he was encountering.  And instead of  making countless references to the photographs both he and Lourdes were  taking, he should've included some of the photos in the book.  Overall, I  wanted more descriptions, to gain more of a sense of being there in  Ireland.  Instead I was left with the feeling that I had eavesdropped on  the unexpected frolic of a middle-aged man and a young Spanish chambermaid  who just happened to meet in Ireland and drive around the countryside for a  bit.  For a better sense of place, skip McFadden's book and try any of the  series of travelling and life in Ireland by Niall Williams and Christine  Breen 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 Buyers beware!  I have never written or posted a consumer rating in my life.  I am so disappointed with Vonage's overall customer service; I feel that I have no choice but to warn others.  Vonage in its own words does not guarantee the quality of its service. Vonage customers will experience: (1) dropped calls, (2) garbled communications, and (3) a non-responsive and dishonest customer service department.  The reason Vonage does not guarantee performance is because it knows that it cannot.  My first mistake was in believing the Vonage help desk, during my initial, "30 Day Money Back Guarantee Period," when they told me my issues were due to line quality and not Vonage.  Since then, I have spent three months with Vonage and my High Speed Internet Service Provider's technicians attempting to make this service work. All speed tests indicate my ISP lines are fine.  I had a High Speed Internet Technician visit my house last week only to tell me everything checks out.  All this said, my Vonage phone has never worked worse.  I made a call today and the recipient could not even discern whom I was.  When I finally threw in the towel and decided that Vonage was not for me, I was hit with a $39.99 service charge upon cancellation plus the cost of the phone, despite a documented lack of performance from day one.    Vonage's performance is substandard by any measure.  Closely look at all other options before bringing Vonage into your life and definitely terminate all agreements within your first 14 days to avoid the inevitable early termination fees.  Make sure you read the below clauses in Vonage's Terms of Service agreement before you agree to anything.  A Vonage Customer Service Manager, Mike, sited these disclaimers when I told him that I was not satisfied with the service: (1)	"No Warranties on Service," section 4, paragraph 4;  (2)	"Return of Device," section 2, paragraph 10; (3)	"Termination Fee," section 3, paragraph 6; and (4)	"Money Back Guarantee; Limitations and Conditions," section 3, paragraph 7.  When I switched to Vonage, I was simply looking for a reliable telephone service and a company that stands behind its product and supports its customers.  Vonage's lack of line reliability and poor customer service has motivated me to document my experience.  I had to call Vonage Customer Service on my old fashion landline because the voice quality on my Vonage phone was so poor that I would not be able to have a conversation.  After waiting for 20 minutes to talk to the Service Manager, Mike, I was told that I was contractually bound because I did not terminate my agreement within the first 30 days.  At this moment I thought of the stereotypical shady used car transaction.  I was lured to buy Vonage because of the promises of great service and all the free bells and whistles that only "internet calling can provide."  Instead I received a lemon, a phone that was unreliable and a company that did not stand behind its product.  While Vonage may get my $39.99 termination fee and the cost of the Vonage phone, I do not feel that I can just lay down about Vonage's failure to perform.  I feel compelled to (1) warn others about Vonage and hopefully save them the aggravation that I have experienced and  (2) Hit Vonage where it hurts, in the economic pocket book.  I am terminating my service as soon as possible.  
 I ordered two items for my sister. After almost three weeks my money was returned with a notice that the items were not in stock. The items were a present for her. I will not order from this seller again. 
 IF YOU WANT TO BREAK YOUR LEASE THIS IS THE CD TO PLAY LOUD. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES MUSIC GO ELSEWHERE. I DON'T MIND NOISE-ROCK WHEN THEIR IS A SEMBLENCE OF RIFF OR MELODY{SONIC YOUTH, BIG BLACK, DON CABALLERO}, BUT THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF PLASTIC. I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER FROM THESE MUSICIANS 
 This printer produces lovely printouts, but as noted above, it uses far too much ink from expensive cartridges.  My biggest problem with it is that there seems to be no way to adjust its automatic scan-crop feature.  I bought it to use as a scanner on a regular basis, but I cannot predict how much of any given document it will decide to chop off.  There is no apparent way to tell it what you want, either.  I wish I'd gotten a less expensive machine with a better user interface 
 I read this book in about 10 years ago with hopes of finding freedom.  I ended up gaining weight and began throwing up to counter the effects of my eating.  I do not blame this book in any way for my behaviors, it just "co-signed" my thinking and told me what I wanted to hear...that I could eat anything.  Eventually, I addressed my food issues from an addiction standpoint, which proved successful for me.   I wish anyone reading this success in their recovery.  I would recommend that they go through this book with the guidance of a therapist or other professional 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 Ms. Landis's story is interesting and sad, human and not very unusual --yet she seems to have been a special person. However, this book is so badly written and awkwardly put together that it's hard to do much more than quickly skim through it only to get the facts 
 This Batman movie is one of the worst Batman movies.  Although The movie suffers from a super silly feel, I still think it might be better than the melodramatic Batman Begins.  Val Kilmar is the worst Batman ever.  Not bad special effects in this 90's movie.  The Batman franchise died with this movie.  The only two good batman movies are Batman and Batman Returns.  Although this movie stinks, it has good special features.  Music videos, making of docs, interviews, dleted scenes: it has all the works.  I would pick it up only if you are a huge Batman fan and want to add it to your collection but otherwise I would just save my money 
 The book's appearance and story line are both lighthearted and gentle with the underlying message that acceptance is the highest of all virtues. This approach will probably work for a typical 5 year old child in a Lesbian led household - especially a girl child. If the child is a boy and/or approachng 8 or 9 years old, the hard questions start coming and this book pretends these questions will never be asked. Doesn't everyone have a father, somewhere? Who is my father? What is he like? Where is he? Does he know about me? Does he care about me? Why don't I know? Why don't you know, Mommy? Mommy, when you grew up you lived with your Daddy, why don't I? When I grow up, should I live with a man or a woman? Why? How/when will I know? Does it matter? Is our family really a complete family if my father is unknown? I want to be a father some day. How do I learn what good fathers do? I love my friends and my dog;Does that make us a family?  Think about it.    
 Ugh. I did not even try to finish the book. It is full of sexual content. Not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature 
 This man obviously knows nothing about human behavior. Most people know that just because someone can't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest. In more cases than not, they simply have low self-esteem are very self-conscious, and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or I might do when asked to do improv. This man himself is a manipulator, and a liar. He's manipulating you to get this book,  taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience. Lying and "hypnotizing" people in order to get the truth out of them, is far less effective than being honest yourself. If you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars. You will start to have an understanding of people's energies if you just pay attention 
 The 3rd edition was VERY different from the 2nd edition. I liked the 2nd edition a lot more 
 Yes, Rifkin's descriptions of the cultural differences between Americans and Europeans make interesting reading, but the vast majority of what he says is anecdotal, if not inaccurate.  I found it amusing to read his praise of Europe's assimilation of immigrants when riots were occurring all over France.  And the idea that the popularity of subscription services and auto leasing means companies are now in the business of selling "time" rather than material products is absurd 
 When i first got this item i loved it I used it 4 times and it stopped working 
 A girlfriend of mine, actually several of them, experimented with this latest date fixer-upper program and no one new is calling. The author provides some useful tips in the book but overall .... Check out Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks books on conscious loving and attracting relationships. Quick fixes in diets and dating offer fast solutions that go just as swiftly. Marianne Williamson is quited often in several chapters and well .... we all know (at least some of us do) ... about Ms. Williamson's relationship patterns. If you want to go from man to man and experience one lover after another abandoning you for his real love ... then listen to Marianne and her flock. Otherwise, check out the Hendricks Institute for advice from a married couple whose been together all the time that Marianne and the author were being dumped over and over again 
 This was my first Amitav Ghosh book after years of hearing people admire him. But I was disappointed. The book starts off interestingly enough, but soon the plot takes over and the characters are reduced to mere devices for the author to make grand political statements about colonialism and its effects. In the process there are simply too many coincidences, too many contrived situations. There is no progression of characters, of a story unfolding. What we get, instead, is a barrage of theses about the postcolonial world.   There are moments of beauty and poignancy in the book, but they are simply too few to hold the reader's attention. Once you get past the professorial lecturing, there's very little by way of a story.   I have since read some of his other books, and I'm happy to say that I liked them all much better than this one 
 When I ordered this book there was another book with a title that was almost identical, but it had a different cover so I ordered it.  Knowing there are an infinite number of crocheted squares, I thought I would be getting the ultimate in diversity.    As it turns out, I had ordered two books that were identical beyond the cover.   To add insult to injury, I had to wait 4 months for the second book.  I know publishers will often change covers and I have always thought of it as being deceptive and this was no different.  Somehow Amazon found out about this and the second book is not being offered any longer, but now I have to go through the extra time to return one of the books.  I am very disappointed in this practice 
 This CD was only average. I didn't really like 'He ain't heavy..." and "Everything is Beautiful". Just not very strong vocals. I did really like "When you tell me that you love me" But that comes on Showstoppers which is a really good CD so I would just suggest that you buy that instead. Though I do like the idea that this CD benefits the red cross.. 
 Meaningless as the title suggests. Borrows from the Postmodern school of pseudo-intellectual gibberish. As relevant to Shakespeare as brainsurgery is to soccer. 
 This magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements.  Advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying, but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous.  These ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine...  It seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness, to the level of competition.  A recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women.  Some of the women had body fat below 10% - I'm trying to get mine below 30%.  It's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely.  I like magazines like Fitness and Shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice.  I can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese.  I can't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch, eat 10 servings of protein a day, and pop potentially dangerous pills.  I am very disappointed with this magazine.. 
 This book is a prime example of the old adage: "Those who can't do, teach." The author of this book has never been the primary author of a major scientific paper (he is a professor of English), but he tries to give advice on how to write an effective scientific article. Because he has little to say on the subject, much of the text is made up of amusing anecdotes and quips rather than substantive guidelines. An example of the unhelpful advice he doles out is on page ninety-two, where he advises the reader to submit a typed, rather than handwritten, manuscript to the publisher. He litters his chapters with cute Peanuts cartoons depicting Snoopy getting rejection letters from publishers: a great way to take up space, but not useful to someone seeking practical advice on how to prepare a scientific article. He also gives advice on good grammar, which is more within his area of expertise. But there are better books on the subject of good writing, the classic example of which is Strunk and White's Elements of Style. I would advise the fledgling scientific writer to read many scientific articles in order to learn how to construct them effectively. On the other hand, if you want to learn how to write a whole book about something of which you know almost nothing, Dr. Day's "How to Write & Publish a Scientific Paper" would be a great place to start 
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 This pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking.  Those are the only good things I can say about it.  It simply does not stay on.  I, too, have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don't lose it.  Maybe I have a defective device, but this is anything but accurate.  I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day.  One day the steps will be 5800, the next day 12800, the next day 10300.  Which is accurate?  Are any of them?  I can't rely on it.  When testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps, it never got it right.  Most of the time it was over the 50 steps, 2 times it was way under the 50 steps.  I would not recommend this one

 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 I selected this book based on De Waal's reputation in primatology, interested in his thoughts on the root traits that define our human societies. Instead, he stumbled into politics often enough I finally set the book aside, unwilling to mix an objective study of science with a subjective analysis of world political problems. He could have cited a variety of international examples, but chose to concentrate on the USA and a few others, leaving me uncomfortable about his motives. I suggest he stick to science in his next book 
 This is Rhino pulling some kind of rip off.  This CD is simply an earlier Rhino release -- THE ULTIMATE YES (2004) -- with a different cover and title.  I mean its exact, track for track.  The only difference is that ULTIMATE included a bonus 3rd disk with five live acoustic tracks.  I have no problem with Rhino releasing a new Yes compilation, but not to re-release the exact same product in a different package.  What's the logic behind this?  This review does not reflect the music or Yes as a whole (I love Yes dearly), In fact, I believeis solely about a stunt that Rhino is pulling.  
 I recieved the car and set it up according to the manufacturers  instructions and it didn't work! I contacted the manufacturer and they mailed me a shipping return label and I returned it to them. I am awaiting a new or fixed car back from them 
 There should beseveral pages of information about each state to make this book educational. It is not nearly enough for a 9-12 year old to learn from.  That is why we are returning it 
 According to "Who Wrote the New Testament," Jesus movements arose in Galilee due to the social experimentation of people responding to the confusion caused by living in a multicultural society. Mack postulates that there were at least five separate groups of Jesus people in the earliest years: 1) the Q community, 2) "The Jesus School", 3) "The True Disciples", 4) "The Congregation of Israel", and 5) "the Jerusalem Pillars", (Mack, 44-45).  Mack argues that the earliest followers of Jesus remembered him as "a teacher who challenged individuals to think of themselves as citizens of the kingdom of God (Mack, 70). This united people in a form of social experimentation in which they met as groups, shared meals, and attributed sayings to Jesus; revising them as needed, to fit the "school of thought they were developing" (Mack, 45, 70). Mack believes that Jesus' earliest followers were not all that interested in preserving his teachings. Rather, they felt free to create or change them to reflect the kind of communities they wanted to become (Mack, 46).   To be clear, Mack is not just postulating differing theologies among early Christians, such as among Hebrew and Hellenist Christians. He is postulating numerous independent Jesus groups with widely divergent beliefs ranging from those who know nothing about a resurrection to those who knowingly made up myths about Jesus as a resurrected god.  Mack's theory of numerous competing Jesus groups does not stand up to close scrutiny. In order for Mack?s theory to work he has to dogmatically assert (ignoring all evidence to the contrary) that the earliest followers of Jesus did not care enough about Jesus to pass on the stories of his life or teachings.   Mack then has to discredit the earliest actual sources for Jesus. So for example, Mack dogmatically asserts that the early Christian history presented in the Book of Acts is historically unreliable. Mack was either unaware, or simply ignored, the work of authors like Colin Hemer, the Greco-Roman scholar from Cambridge University, who provided a detailed defense of the historical reliability of the Book of Acts in his book, "The Book of Acts in the Setting of Hellenistic History" (Eisenbrauns, 1990).   Having dismissed the earliest actual sources for the history of Jesus, Mack then relies on imaginative reconstructions of hypothetical sources. In fact, Mack's theory of early conflicting Jesus communities is largely based on the dogmatic assertions of what must have happened, based on the postulation of the imagined beliefs (and dis-beliefs) of hypothetical communities behind the hypothetical redactions of various ancient documents; all the while dismissing the earliest actual sources like Luke/Acts or the letters of Paul as completely unreliable, in spite of numerous scholarly studies to the contrary.   For example, while many scholars believe that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke may have been dependent on a lost source that scholars now call "Q", the fact is that "Q" remains a hypothesis. To postulate, as Mack does, the imaginative history of a hypothetical community behind a hypothetical gospel, and then to presume to tell readers what this and other hypothetical communities supposedly did or did not believe, is to move well beyond the realm of scholarship into the realm of conspiracy theories!  When Mack says that the Jesus movements arose in Galilee due to the social experimentation of people responding to the confusion caused by living in a multicultural society, it sounds like he is confusing first century peasants with modern academics. I suspect that first century Palestinian peasants often worked from sun up to sun down struggling to put food on the table, and had much less time for social experimentation? than 21st century academics sitting in their ivory towers pulling down six figure salaries while they come up with controversial new theories in their attempt to publish and not perish. One must conclude that the only mythmaking in "Who wrote the New Testament"; the Making of the Christian Myth, is the mythology contributed by Burton Mack himself.  
 This book has some nice color photographs, and is another way to get the Starbucks name out into the public.  It really is nothing about Starbucks or Passion, has a few recipies 
 This is a nice DVD, if you don't mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3).  If you're okay with that, enjoy! 
 Look, the book was OK, but...its the worst book Ive ever read. Its not even original, Its a reteeling of Romeo and Juliet. The plot twists is really bad and predictable. COME ON PEOPLE! DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT ITS REALISTIC. I MEAN, BY COINCIDENCE, SHE JUST HAPPENS TO-- I DONT WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY. If your curious and bored enough, read the book. Even 10 year-olds can see that this is not realistic, Phil Pullman is a fairy tale writer and he should stick to that By the way, the sex scene is not that shocking, its just plain..let me put it this way, it was written by a horny, bald, peverted 40 year old man 
 Written in cartoon format, I thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight, dry, biography of scientists.  However, it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids.  The cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known, so using it as an initial reading is impossible.  Further, some content is offensive.  On the second page of cartoons, a scientist is walking along a bridge, thinking, when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump, saying, "No woman is worth committing suicide over."  The pictures show a scantily-clad woman (with bare bottom in one frame) that he is now picturing in his mind.  Irrelevant and inappropriate!  Plus, I didn't have to go far to find swear words in the captions.  Yikes!  My kids will never see this book!  It is not even appropriate for high-school age kids.  (In fact, it isn't even funny to adults! 
 I've read other books by the author and truly enjoyed them.  Not this one.  Cleage revisits characters from, "Some Things I Thought I'd Never Do".  The book starts out promising, then introduces to many characters.  This could have been two good books instead of one mediocre book. 
 Amazon.com does not tell you on the description page that you cannot receive a refund for this terrible product.  The interface (Adobe eBook Reader) is acceptable for a volume that will be read page-by-page.  It is TOTALLY wrong for this 1,000+ page reference book.  It is a nightmare to find anything in this product.  Buy the hardcover or paper back but don't throw away $30 on this version.  Tecnically speaking it, it's a bow-wow 
 I tried to embrace this book--I really did. It was tempting to want to have at last found a piece of academic writing that deftly encapsulates and explains this clash of titans: jihad and globalism. Barber's main title is, however, more tantalizing than explanatory. This book demonstrates the dangers of allegiance to dichotomies; there are other forces at work in society that grapple with the headline-stealing titans.  This is an important book at least insofar as it captures a growing sentiment among academics interested in the socio-economic forces that compel current events. It is not, therefore, an easy read for the layman (particularly the last part of the book) which is ironic given his call to grassroots citizen action.   Barber asserts--really insists with an uncomfortable brand of academic arrogance--in almost narrowly political overtones that the world is immersed in a battle of opposing ideologies: the corporate, amoral and homogenized one that really is without ideology and the local, or tribal, and rigidly moral and fragmented one that is part ideology, part myth-making.  Unfortunately, in his earnestness to construct and defend his convenient dichotomy, he conforms exceptions to his rule. The jihadists--whether ethnic hatemongers or terrorists--have for Barber retained some residue of moral dignity while the globalist--whether gullible, materialistic and indifferent consumers or manipulative, multinational executives--have altogether lost their moral compass.  His solution (which he fails to outline, thus making his work more of a polemic and manifesto rather than manual for change) is an activist citizenry fully appreciative of their need and ability to shore up the civil sector of modern societies. Here again Barber is remiss, revealing that writing from one's desk rather than the field has its limitations. He fails to acknowledge, for example, the extent to which the lack of a civic tradition in such nations as Russia and China impedes social progress of the sort he pines for. And the following further indicates his lack of awareness of Chinese cultural resiliency: "What is striking is that even here where a native culture might be thought to have its greatest chances against the children of the Western Enlightenment, McWorld seems irresistible."(190)  Aside from this concern, and his lack of concrete solutions and elusive, often inaccessible writing style, Barber tends to exaggerate the extent to which corporate influence is mitigated by both government and civic organizations, especially in the Western democracies. He is undeservedly far too pessimistic in this regard and fails to note the many ways in which a bygone American lacked a collective sense of civic duty. Moreover, his analysis is flawed, as I believe you will also discover, by his apparent aspirations to global citizenship. Nor, as other reviewers have noted, has he given due credit to the government and business sectors in creating a climate for a civic society to exist, must less flourish with some degree of autonomy. The symbolic assault on McDonald's is both tedious and unfair. While guilty of promoting unhealthy diets to some extent, it is a zealous stretch to accuse this and other multinationals of single handedly distorting the cultural landscape of developing nations. And even in the U.S., McDonald's has played a civic role via the Ronald McDonald House, it's management hiring practices and provisions for inner-city employment.  This book, perhaps like this review, could have been thought out more and condensed considerably. For a far better articulated review of this book see Gary Rosen's piece online from the journal First Things 
 This Skip Spence Oar cd is really bad. To hear other peoples reviews it sounded like the best thing in the world. Its no wonder why this album was a flop when it came out. Thirty five years later it is not any better. 
      This book is full of superficial platitudes from the New Age Rainbow Coalition of the 1980s, John Marks Templeton, then Norman Vincent Peale (Mason and Shriner) and Robert Schuller ("Hour of Power" television program; do most weird things come from California?). This is the Gospel of Success and Possibility Thinking. His book, like "The Course in Miracles" teaches that "forgiveness" is simply recognizing that sin does not exist and therefore there is nothing to forgive. To accept the Courses teachings is to reject all Biblical doctrine, yet those who embrace it are able to call themselves Christians.        Like Courses, "A New You" is the  promotion to ignore our sinful nature, which is right in line with Schuller's philosophy. This non-offensive positive gospel of to "believe in SELF" is hardly new. This new reformation is not repentance or a renewed sense of dependence on God and his word. No humbling ourself before Almighty God. In fact it is the very opposite, a boosting of ourselves to a "divine self-esteem." (Schuller was helped into ministry by Masonic brother Billy Graham.) Schuller's salvation was one of eliminating the pain of fear. To Schuller, "faith" is visualization, a power of the mind; "God" is there to help one "believe" and activate our mind power which will change our environment. Schuller smiles as he says "now believe and you will achieve." He declares in "Self-Esteem:" "Christ was the world's greatest possibility thinker. Do we dare follow him?" Peale has said, "Positive thinking is just another term for faith." The Bible says "God forbid that I should glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."       It would be better to define sin, demonic influences, hell, salvation, the gospel, and the term "born again." The Bible tells us that we are all sinners; our righteousness is like filthy rags before God, that we've all sinned and fall short of His glory, and that there are none who are naturally good or righteous. The Christian strategy is the attempt to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition. This book is psychology and it has come into the church disguised as a help to our self worth. But this is HUMANISN and is antithetical the very essence of the gospel. Read I Tim. 1:15. (Google search: schuller minister).       This book is full of disturbing thoughts: We should seek angels as our protectors and intercessors (207). Try nature worship! "Nature is nourishment for our souls" (197). We must turn over a new leaf (self-reformation); "this is a new day" (195). Imagination is the key to the door of  the future (62). You can have whatever you say if you believe in your heart and doubt not. Your imagination [not faith] creates your reality (59). You can lift up YOURSELF into the realm where all things are possible (245, don't give God the glory). We are Christians if we remain positive (173). Faith is though our own efforts of "persistence and determination" (79). God loves everyone, that's why He made so many unbelievers. Therefore everyone is basically good in God's eyes. You must bring out that love of God [whoever is your God] and the goodness within yourself to realize your salvation, because God is love, and love never fails (229). There is NO mention of Jesus as personal Savior, only the universal force "Master Map Maker" (241, so no faiths will be offended). Every member [every life form, including trees and birds] of God's creation is linked by a common thread; watch nature for the answers (233, shades of PANTHEISM). "We [all] are sons and daughters of the magnificent King" (173, NO Biblical salvation needed !!!). 
 I bought and read this book for a class and found it very difficult to take much away from. The accounts are potentially very enlightening, but the author's writing style obfuscates their values. Her interjection of her own personal stories into the work was sloppy and often left me unsure of who I was reading about. While I don't know of any other book which tells these stories, there are many other books that contain similar accounts which are far more effective 
 I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...        
 With this book, I was expecting Zinn to go into more detail about America in the 20th century, but it is essentially the 20th century chapters of People's History of the United States taken out and labeled as a new and different book. If you have an older version of Pepole History of the United States by Howard Zinn, the Twentieth Century might be good because of the chapters relating to the elder Bush and Clinton administrations. The rest of the chapters are in people's history. However, recent version the people history of the united states do contain the extra chapters so if it would be better  to just get a later version of People's History of the United States instead if you don't have a copy yet 
 Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts describes marriage as " a supernatural event founded upon a mutual exchange of holy pledges." The authors save this description for the last chapter, however, from the third chapter on the book is creepily christianic. They ultimately trivialize all advice that can be found in seminars, counseling, mentors, and books, presumably, even their own. All that a marriage really needs is religion.  I want my money back 
 I should first probably note that I read this book about 10 years ago, and I don't really recall all that much, except the profound pain I had penetrating my skull after finishing the book.  I was just browsing Conan books after finishing the collection of Robert E. Howard's original stories, "The Conquering Sword of Conan" (absolutely incredible, by the way) when I came across this tragedy of a Conan story.  Now, unless I'm completely off, this is the one where Conan somehow gets thrown into a colleseum and becomes a gladiator.  Sounds a worthy tale for our Cimmerian warrior, right?  Wrong.  After the initial fight scenes, Conan somehow gets talking with a priest in the colleseum, who consequently CONVERTS CONAN TO PACIFISM.  Read that sentence again and let it sink in.  Conan, the irresistable elemental force who serves as the prototype for all barbarian heroes in modern sword and sorcery, begins to question his violent way of life.  I don't remember how the story ends, but I'm sure it was pretty awful. The only positive point was the addition, near the begining, of the character "Roganthus the Strong Man".  Thinking back, I'm not really sure why I liked this guy, perhaps it was just the comedic name.  Anyway, what was Leonard Carpenter thinking?  Shame on you sir.  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you were either drunk or suffering a mild concussion when you wrote this one 
 ...at least of the ones I've had, and I've had a lot of them. This is like a bad sitcom where they take chunks of older epsiodes and try to make a new one because they're too cheap and out of ideas to make something new. Most of the DVD is made up of classic, but heavily duplicated shorts having to do with numbers. There was not one that I did not already know was on another DVD. In between, they had Elmo and Telly doing some kind of video-game like adventure that made no sense. Much of the acting and movement was so bad that I think that they must have just done it with one take and accepted it. Come to think of it, the plot is so weak that they may have made that up as they went along. As if to add insult to injury, the DVD is very badly made so that you can only get to the video by fast-forwarding (not skipping!) through the annoying commercials in the front, especially that god-awful elmocize commercial that gives us parents nightmares. If you skip it, then you see the FBI warning (oh pleeze) and the Sony Wonder logo, and then you're back to the main menu to start all over again. It's like trying (and failing) to get a piece of childrens software to run on the computer - a crap shoot, and you only wind up frustrated and with a very angry toddler. Save yourself the pain and annoyance, this DVD isn't worth the plastic it's made out of 
 I was so disappointed when I got this book. The people who do these books always seem to have a head full of hair when they start.  I never see anyone with not-so-thick hair or less than shoulder length hair.  Her product regimen was outrageous.  Her copying and pasting from week-to-week had to be most ingenuous of all, along with pushing her own hair care products.  In all her pictures she looked "greasy", which is not a look or feel I like.  She had not even used Aphogee protein products, which ANYONE who is into hair, knows is probably one of the BEST protein products on the market, especially considering the price.  I just expected a little bit more.  On her picture in the 1990s, it was obvious she always had a full head of hair, not like a lot of black women out here.  Can someone show me how to maintain my relaxed hair, where it will have body and look healthy, and if I did choose to relax at home, the best way to do it.  We know it is a cardinal sin, but obviously people do it or there would not be so many products on the shelves and the costs to go a hairdresser is so prohibitive.  I say do not buy this book, there is hardly anything said you probably don't already know.  
 That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.  Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever 
 After seeing Jon Kabat-Zinn on McLaughlin's One-on-One I was intrigued and decided to buy this book.  I was sorely disappointed. He makes some good observations (e.g. about ADD and the 24/7 lifestyle), but offers solutions based only on far-eastern philosophies (yoga, meditation, etc).  Not what I expected.  I would not recommend this book to devout Christians or Muslims.  Better stick with the Bible or the Koran, or the writings of accomplished Biblical or Koranic scholars 
 yeah....this cd bit.  i bought chillout sessions 4 last year, and looked forward to buying this compilation as well.  unfortunately, it didn't live up to the last one.  out of the 20 or so tracks on the first cd, i liked 2-3...and they were all on other compilations i already own.  the same was true for the second cd.  this was not worth the money.  i was very disappointed 
 WELL, GREAT ACTING, GREAT MUSIC, GREAT COSTUMES. TO BAD THEY RUINED THE MOVIE BY MAKING IT A PRO MARXIST MOVIE. I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ENJOYING A MOVIE IN WHICH THE STARS ARE IN LOVE WITH A MARXIST REVOLUTION. WOW! WOULEND'T IT BE GREAT TO HAVE A COMMUNIST  GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA. 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 I had ordered two of this item and then changed my mind and returned both for credit.  When the credit was processed I only received credit for one. It has been very difficult to contact the correct person to get this error corrected.  Your assistance in clearing this issue will be greatly apapreciated.  I know you are not the correct department but I am hoping you can forward my message to the correct area for processing of credit to my account.  Thank you Joanne Woodma 
 This book will be a lovely addition to my compost heap.  I couldn't find any sense in the character's motivations so the whole mess became a simple, predictable voyage through a hamlet that any five-year-old could have dreamt up.  When coming across this one on the shelf, my advice is to keep on browsing 
 A cookbook written by someone who hates cooking.  How good can her recipes taste?  I rest my case 
 I recently read a book called "The Eiger Sanction." I found it very poorly written: no meat for the intellect--- it provides merely vulgar entertainment for the gonads. There is nothing one can sink one's cerebral cortex into. It is sensation for the sake of stimulation, with nothing to occupy the mind. While billed as a "spy novel," there is very little inside to suggest this. There is no witty plot; no cleverness on the part of the characters. The main character is mentally ill, tasteless, uninteresting, and a murdering sociopath--- and is also *BORING!* If meeting such a person in real life, one would not waste one's time even saying "Hello" to him: it's a waste of time spending three or four days reading about him. The author doesn't even have him face justice for his murders: he's rewarded for his killings 
 too rigid and too religous for my taste. some good ideas if you can get past the pitfalls though 
 I found this book a bit boring. In the beginning, the book is a little slow, and then the adventure picks up, and then slows down again at the end. I also thought that the book was on the harder side; there are lots of characters to remember and some of them have the very similar names, so sometimes it can become just a little confusing. I would not recommend this book to others because it wasn't interesting and it wasn't a page-turner. Historical-fiction lovers would probably find this to be okay though 
 If my eleventh grade son had written this book, I would have given it a D-.  When Rashid Khalidi write it, it gets a triple F.  The logic is not there, the facts are wrong.  Can't Palestinians do more than hate Israelis? 
 I read all the review I could find on this product and most were bad.  A few recent ones were better.  The first problem I encountered was the power on button did not function correctly.  I had to press, press harder, shake the device, and finally turn it upside down while pressing to power it on.  I was never able to power it down with the on/off button.  The wireless AP worked fine but it would not function with an ethernet cable.  I thought it was me (though I've unboxed and setup 25+ wireless, wire only, routers, swithes, etc. without problems.  After several hours of trying different approaches I looked at documentation, knowledge base articles and found one that indicated if the device power light blinked continuously the device was defective.  That was the end of it and I returned it for credit.   I do not recommend this device to anyone.  T. Ragan - Cypress, T 
 I was very excited to hear that this new Muppets Holiday offering was coming!  The previous two Christmas albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver & "A Muppet Christmas Carol") have long been family favorites at hour house in December.  However, this time I am disappointed.  Most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous.  I realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us.  But, to focus on these voices so much (Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Statler & Waldorf, The Swedish Chef) in this album, only produces a disappointing reminder that the "Muppets" we grew up with are long gone.  Maybe I am being a little hard on this cd.  But, there are plenty of Muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices (Robin, Sam, Honeydew & Beaker, Rizzo, Louzeland, etc).  Those voices added to those of Ganzo, Miss Piggy and Fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel.  There are a couple of good cuts on the album.  One is "Merry Christmas" by Pepe.  The other is "Santa Baby" by Miss Piggy.  Sadly, over all I can not recommend this cd. 
 The writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense.  I thought something might change, that it might become an interesting ghost story, or there might be moral issues, or maybe even a character would grow or change.  The heavy-handed ending is, perhaps, intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in Amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones...but that's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness.  Are we supposed to take everything that Ellie says about the Amish in court (peaceful, gentle, incapable of murder, loving, child-centric, willing to accept an out-of-wedlock child into the community) as lies?  The ending belongs to a much darker book.  My biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing, I kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story.  
 This book is incoherent.  I read plenty of Sci-fi saw some of the rave reviews and thought I would try this novel.  What a mistake- I could not get past the first 30 pages.  After that I just flipped through the pages without reading them to see, in vain, if something would grab me.  I could not understand what was going on, or what this book was about.  I dont understand how someone could write so incoherently.  A possible explanation is that some of the reviews mention that this book was originally separate stories.   I think the author has a great imagination, is creative and has innovative concepts with respect to cyber technology.  However, none of that resulted I a novel that I could comprehend. 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 i used this book in a university course, i got very little out of it.  it had handwavy explanations for almost every topic it discussed.   when i tried to actually use the material, i found it useless because it skipped all the details.   i had to spend hours on hours googling and wikiing to find information that the bok should have had 
 I was disappointed with the book. I found some of the patterns to be old fashioned...and not  quite retro yet. I am planning to knit the rug, but have not chosen a project from the book yet. This is a book you should check out of yoru library before you commit. A long list of knitting stores is at the front of the book. 
 I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming.  But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you.    See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack.  They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.  Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.  And Lexie... she's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies... and they put ASHLEY JUDD in the role.  Hello...?!?!  Does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you? That's just the biggie complaints, too.    Read the book, don't watch the movie.  You'll be amazed at how inept Hollywood was at telling this story 
 I used this book as the text in a university linguistics course. Baker and Jones are very thorough in their analysis of bilingualism and bilingual education.  At times, they are so thorough that the subject matter is much too elementary and common-sensical.  It's also extremely repetitive.  However, as a basic and solid reference for any questions or research one might need, this volume is sure to help 
 I bought this book because others had written how it was so much more comprehensive than the first edition. Unfortunately, David Keirsey appears to have fallen prey to the ego-elevating practice of creating his own labels for established concepts without adding information to those concepts.   Specifically, I was particularly annoyed by his tunnel-vision regarding the meanings of the Myers-Briggs letters. Most people already understand that extroverted and introverted characteristics have to do with social interactions. To label them expressive and reserved, respectively, seems unnecessary.   Although "sensory" could use some clarification, naming it "observant" seems to negate the intuitive person's ability to observe the feelings underneath feelings in others. Calling an intuitive person "introspective" also seems to serve this purpose, although the full description in the back of the book clarifies this somewhat.   In addition, naming "thinking" people "tough-minded" seems to place a negative connotation on this characteristic, which seems to support Mr. Keirsey's own complaint that people see those who have a greater tendency toward paying attention to their thoughts than their feelings as "heartless" (page 334). Then he labels "feeling" people as "friendly," which is a better descriptor of social interactions (i.e., extroversion or introversion) than the internal processes of thinking and feeling. Friendliness would also only be apparent in those labeled extroverted.   Finally, even though Mr. Keirsey complained that Myers' descriptions of "judging" and "perceiving" focused on only one aspect of these letters, he proceeded to do the same thing, only in a different direction, by labeling them "scheduling" and "probing." These terms are no more comprehensive than the original ones, and I find it arrogant of Mr. Keirsey to decide for Myers what her terms meant.   Personally, I believe Mr. Keirsey did a better job in his first book regarding these descriptions, which are the foundation for everything else discussed in the book 
 Readers interested in Benny Morris should read Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath's "War and Remembrance" in the summer 2002 issue of Azure. Porath adds to the Oct. 1995 and April 1990 discussions by Robert Satloff and Shabtai Teveth in Middle Eastern Studies and to Efraim Karsh's  excellent book, Fabricating Israeli History. Don't read this book without looking at these critiques.   Why? Morris et al tell readers they have written "new" history of Israel, considering the entire previous historical record as if it were solely propaganda for the Zionist cause. Here, Morris considers Jewish conduct in the 1947 and 1948, and why the Arabs fled.   Morris claims to be the first person to have looked at Israeli archives on the Dalet Plan, a plan to move populations in certain areas. Nevertheless, other scholars show that Morris and his peers in this book misrepresent themselves and the facts.   Firstly, Yigael Alon and Israel Galili, in The Book of the Palmah, gave Walid Khalidi material to argue in 1959 that the Dalet Plan was "the master plan of the Zionists" to expell Palestinians wholesale. Furthermore, the 1973 History of the Hagana (by Uri Millstein) included the entire Dalet Plan text. Official or not, these 1959 and 1973 Israeli Jewish histories, very shortly after the the 1948 war, did not hide what happened, as Morris claims here.  Morris also writes that Arab government archives were closed to his research and and to other historians writing on the Israeli-Arab conflict before him. He writes that he relied on Israeli and Western archives. But Porath, Karsh, Satloff and Teveth all show that this is not the case.   Furthermore, Morris did no research at the Hagannah archives or those of the IDF, a fact underlined by Efraim Karsh in 2002, and one which he admits in a more recent book (The War for Palestine). Morris now writes that in the mid 1980s both those archives were closed to all researchers after all. He writes, he was limited to few first-hand military materials, indicating that there is no "new" research here at all.   Morris' charge that Israel carried out a deliberate and systematic expulsion of the Palestinian Arabs isn't even remotely substantiated by extensive research done since the mid 1980s. On the contrary, Morris takes material very selectively, from Israeli archive fringes and makes what Porath terms "outrageoulsy false claims"-- that Israel's victory resulted from "an imperialist conspiracy or an overwhelming advantage in manpower and arms."   Indeed, Morris writes here that Arabs left Israel because of many factors, their departure was not the fault of the Jewish people alone. Then, he contradicts himself, giving those who hate Israel grounds to blame Israel for the exodus, without considering the other circumstances.   This book also details a so-called "massacre" in 1948 of Arabs at the village of Deir Yassin, but not enough to mention that the incident was actually a battle--in which most Arabs killed (like those in Jenin in March and April 2002) were armed.   Finally, Morris does not note (by comparison) other massacres in 1948--of Jews, by Arabs. On December 30, 1947, for example, Arabs murdered some 50 Jewish co-workers at the Haifa refinery. On April 13, 1948, they massacred over 80 Jewish doctors, nurses and Hebrew University workers on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.   Additionally, nearly all of the 131 people who surrendered at the Etzion Bloc were also murdered by Palestinian Arabs. Only two survived.  These latter Arab massacres of Jews do not fit the blame that Morris seeks to lay at Jewish feet. Nor does the fact that Jews did not afterwards flee, as occurred on the Arab side following the battle at Deir Yassin. So Morris omits them.   I also find it disturbing that the book nowhere mentions the equal refugee claim of 1 million Jewish refugees from 22 Arab nations, who were expelled with nothing but the shirts on their backs, and rebuilt their lives in Israel, the U.S., and Europe.   The number of Jewish refugees was actually larger than that of Arab refugees (counting only those who fled, not their descendants). Honest history would have noted these parallels as well as the entire context of the war.   --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 As a passive individual, I live through the words and  experiences of first hand authors for my adventure. This narrative simply scratches the surface of those before it. "Ship of Gold", "The Fatal North" and "Abandon Ship!" come to mind immediately as adrenaline rush examples.   Any of the several publications on "The Endurance" far exceed the expectations of "Deep Blue".   The human spirit has greater tales to tell 
 I have a very hyper mini schnauzer and i thought that i could control her aggressive barking and yapping.  It is very out of control and this device didnt help at all. I know am purchasing a tritronic no bark shock collar.  A friend has one and recommended it to me.  They are 99 dollars but this is 25 and not worth a dime to me. The dazer does get animals attention for a while but they soon get use to it and then all you can do for it to be effective is to throw it at them. 
 Book starts of with "Is this a Con?" like it's a hint of what's to come.  Childish stories about how the doctrines of the Worldwide Church were all wrong and suddenly needed to be changed. Maybe the recruitment tactics were not working anymore; or the false prophecies, scandals and financial ruin of its members had taken their toll on the organization. It was time to turn this thing 180' around, but what they did sunk the ship, and maybe that was their intent! Sure sounds like a conspiracy theory, and sure enough it seemed that way as the news of coming changes leaked out, only to confuse the once faithful. Why would ministers preach what they didn't believe? Well the money and benefits were pretty good. Strange how the sabbath changed along with unclean meats, holydays, tithing, healing, etc. Looks like Tkatch found the stairway to heaven, and Armstrong was no longer the infallible pope. Even the holy spirit changed into a person. And what the pagan trinity and the symbol of the cross became Kosher? The book mentions Herbert W Armstrong being the master salesman, and like a bar a soap he had to make his church unique so his followers would use no other. He started positioning his product by identifying all others as inferior or even worthless, as misleading, as spurious and even hurtful. Of course, he will have to use basically the same ingredients for his soap that they do in theirs, but will change the name of those ingredients. We were told that we were the "only true" soap. So when Tkatch and Co. began admitting  we weren't the only real soap out there, it all started to look so bogus. In their disillusionment many members started spinning off to splinter groups. Quite a few abandoned religion altogether and tried to live a normal life again. That was the real transformation as nauseating and heart breaking as you would ever experience. How could we have believed such things? By the means of Fear Induction Psychology and Mind Control by its leaders, this cult and its many divisions have manipulated the lives of its members and destroyed their lives. The book ends up bashing old Armstrong pretty well, but contradictorily says they are not judging him. Makes it worth the $1.09 the printed version is going for, but do a search and save the postage, unless you need the kindling.  For the survivors: "Does anyone remember laughter?" 
 The protagonist of "Apex Hides the Hurt" is a "nomenclature consultant," a guy who names stuff--products, businesses, etc.--and yet he, himself, is given no name in the novel.  It's a bit of an obvious stunt, but then so are most of Whitehead's techniques here.  His concern is style: clever, rhythmic prose, language that surprises and delights.  ("He was watching an old black and white movie on television, the kind of flick where nothing happened unless it happened to strings.  Every facial twitch had its own score.  Every smile ate up two and a half pages of sheet music.")  And Whitehead's themes are all very obvious; he dives straight through the surface to play down there in the dark with subtext.  Which can work for you, or not--all depending on how patient a reader you are.  But back to the protagonist.  He's a black man who has been called to the town of Winthrop to rename it.  One faction wants the name to stay the same; another wants it returned to the name that the town received from its pioneering, African-American founders, "Freedom"; and yet another wants to rename it "New Prospera" to compliment its modern, high-tech, capitalist orientation.  Our hero is just recovering from a large setback in his career and personal life, so the pressure to pull off this job is high for him.  Unfortunately, the reader is given little reason to make a similar investment in the novel.    Despite Whitehead's stunning, linguistic inventiveness, his protagonist's work never seems like much of a challenge, and the plot is thin, thin, thin.  Sure, there is enough great stuff here that it could have been put to good use somehow, and the ending does finally--for the first time in the book--pack a significant punch.  But for a good portion of the book, the story just spins its wheels, going nowhere that's very interesting.  By my reckoning (using an admittedly unorthodox algebra) the climax to the story would have had twice the impact if this 200-page book had been half as long--had been, say, a 75- or 100-page novella 
 Great cd. Imus in the morning recommended highly and the I-man was not wrong. One of the best cd's I've owned in years. I listen to a lot of Buffett, James Taylor, Delbert McClinton, and this cd places high in these ranks 
 We use Gallup at my workplace.  Gallup is an excellent organization and we're better for working with them.  However, this was too much.  It's not a book.  It's a brochure.  Their Engagement Index is brilliant, but you can skim the other 260 pages without missing anything important.    
 In New York City, Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) is a spoiled wealthy immature young woman, living as if she were a princess in a fairy tale. Her father was a popular rock-and-roll guitar player, who died in a plane crash with Molly's mother when she was a little girl. On her birthday party in a nightclub, she meets Lorraine "Ray" Schleine (Dakota Fanning), a nasty young girl with attitudes of adult , living with her careless mother and a terminal father in a fancy uptown apartment. When the accountant of Molly vanishes with her US$ 100,000,000.00 inheritance, Molly is left with nothing but debts, and she needs to work to survive without having previous experience or any skills. She is hired to be Ray's babysitter, and their close contact makes Molly reach the maturity and Ray act like as a child of her age. The film's weakest link is the script, it simply isn't enough to hold your attention all the way through and descends into cliche-ridden moments which do nothing to emphasise the talents of the two leads. 
 This book is okay but if you are looking for a good how to knit or reference book I highly recommend: The Knitters's Companion or Vogue Knitting The Ultimate Reference        
 There's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. The worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that William Gibson has given us). The science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.  The theory doesn't hold, though. This just isn't a very good book.   The action follows three different characters, along three different threads. At first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. Their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. It has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.  There is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time I did I was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.  There are three major problems with this book:  Information withholding: I like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. It's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. But the mysteries need to resolve. The author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. As I said: by the time I figured out what was going on, I'd stopped caring. This might just be my limitations as a reader, but I gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. You work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.  Dreams: Harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. This is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. Generally speaking, as soon as I hit a dream sequence, I lose interest. I lost interest a lot in this book. Which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. It just needs to be presented better.  Unremitting dourness: There is nothing pleasant about reading this book. The main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. Often all three. And, with the exception of the wife (who I liked almost as much as I pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. The worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. There's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. The whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.  The writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. Lots of tortured, passive sentences. A few bits of dialogue that sound like campy Chandler.   Harrison is obviously very talented. I wanted very much to like this book, and I suspect I'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. There's a great deal of potential here. It's just that most of it went unrealized 
 Taking gratuitous advantage of inner city poor seems a cheap shot for a wealthy white man. I have one question for the director: Why don't you make a movie and expose the degenerate aspects of your own people? Exploiting others is no way to make your way in this world. Even though such behavior made your father rich, you should try to be a better man 
 I only used the cup 4 times before my trying to get the lid back on (not exactly easy because of push on design versus screw on), caused the inner lid seal to break. The lid is now worthless and needs to be replaced.  Now I have to deal with seeing if Amazon will help me replace the unit, even though I already sent the packaging to the recycler a week or so ago.  I would not recommend anyone purchasing this unit, due to the lid issue and other points made in the other comments herein 
 This little book is, in my opinion, a really poor attempt at humor and a huge disappointment to the wonderful Bridget Jones diaries.  If  you have read the Bridget Jones books, then this little book is unnecessary since it is just regurgitated material from her diaries.  However, if you have not read the Bridget Jones diaries yet, I highly suggest you do that first since this little book might be a turn-off if you don't know what you are dealing with ahead of time.  This book contains silly pictures of how to shove things under your bed before company comes and how to call for Domino's delivery...(yes, there are pictures showing the reader how to dial the telephone, but it doesn't stop there.  We also get photographic details on how to open the box and put the pizza in our mouths!)  If this kind of information could be useful to you then, by all means, get this book.  However, if you are like most of us and already know how to dial a telephone, stick a slice of pizza in your mouth, shove things under your bed and step on a bathroom scale, then I suggest you save your (money) 
 These DVDs have a funky copy protection that caused the disc to get stuck in my mac mini.  As of yet, I have not been able to remove it.  I don't want to force it out or have to pay for something because of this manufacturer's stupidity.  It is definitely copy protected because when I tried to play it on Windows, it refused due to copyright issues.  I was only trying to play it on my PC!  I wasn't even copying it.  If you plan on watching it on your computer, forget about it... it won't work.  Not even on Media Center.  For copy protection alone I have to rate this set at the lowest setting.  If I was able to play the discs, I would give a decent recent but the protection has rendered both the discs and my computer useless 
 This book may contatin alot of useful information. I am a second year student in the Child And Youth Worker program, and it cost me about $140, for about $50 of use...  alot of the information in this book was new to me, and I did learn alot, but having said that, the only reason I bought it was because it was mandatory.  This book is the most boring piece of crap I have had to read thus far in my program. Facts left and right, but little connection in the actual paragraphs. All connections made are in blurbs about other people's storys. And even those a weak at best. I recomend NOT buying this book. Waste of money and time. If you in college and you need to buy it, show your prof. these two reviews, then refuse to buy it yourself : 
 This book did not benifit my child at all, I do not know how anyone can say that it helps. My child was so bored with it she did not pay any attention to the words, she was just set on getting it done. I talked to the local principal at my community school, and he said that he tryed using, but the children were just not able to apply themselves, and like my daughter were just set on getting it done. Half of the kids would not even do it themselves, they would copy off of each other 
 I have a Ph.D studying the Christian right and this is the worst book on Fundamentalism and the Christian Right that I have ever seen.  What is not outright lies are "straw men" arguments meant to make anyone who believes in Christianity look like an idiot.  I feel bad for the people who gave it a good review, they have been duped by the authors who are not arguing a case or explaining the Christian Right, they are feeding propoganda for their own side.  I was given a free copy of this book and after reading it, I threw it in the trash instead of donating it to a library, it is that bad.  Be sure to know something about the author of a book before you buy it, especially on a controversial topics like this one.   
 Turgid, juvenile, witless, inconsistent, pointless, flaccid. Reads like the kind of "You Are There" episode a teenage boy would write, featuring of course sex with the historical figure of ones choice. I got the impression that Aldiss fell asleep at the typewriter several times during the writing of the manuscript, and resumed upon waking with whatever popped into his head, without respect for what had just been written. Bad as the movie was, I conclude that it was an improvement over the book 
 Ok i have a couple of these tongs sitting in a box and trust me that is where they belong.They are hard to use because when you move the slide lock up they open completly wide and if you want to quickly lock or unlock then forget it there are beter ones on the market that can be locked and unlocked with one hand not two like these require and the metal feels cheap and they are very light a slight wind will knock them right onto the floor.Spend a little more cash for the OXO locking tongs  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000CCY1L/qid=1122017598/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_sbs_1/002-9480983-6492045?v=glance&s=kitchen&n=507846  Trust me you will like them bette 
 If this is all you hear about dear little Simone, you will miss a great deal. The author seems to miss the profound paradox of her work and vision, choosing rather to engage in easy modern psychology.  Read Simone!

 This was the first book I ever read by this author.  The book starts out rather amusing and funny, and even though the plot seems silly it starts out pretty well.  For the most part, the book kept my interest, up until the end which was waaaaay to quick and the whole scene with the wedding was just stupid.  Infact, I really liked the book up until the stupid ending.  And Erdle was a disgusting character and I couldn't stand him at all 
 "I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours. But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves." Voltaire (1755 
 I opened this book without having read a single review, armed solely with the knowledge that it had won the National Book Award.  I wish I had been armed with a paper shredder.  For such a rich and potentially captivating topic, Tuck did a horrendous job.  The life of the beautiful Ella Lynch, mistress South America's most enigmatic and charismatic tyrant, should have provided us with cutural and personal insights beyond a standard history text book.  For example, I would have liked to have finished this book with an understanding of how Francisco Solano Lopez managed to inspire 60% to 80% (depending on your source) of his country's inhabitants to die in a war which had absolutely no rationale.  Instead, I got a good solid dose of the Latin Lover.  Tuck did her research, but not to a greater degree than any high school student.  At no point in the story did I gain an understanding of the causes of the war, or of the unique political and social position held by Paraguay in South America at that time.  Not only did Tuck miss the broader context--the political rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, the constant power vacillations of post-independence South America, the struggle to establish national identities--she completely failed to establish the character of Paraguay and Paraguayans.  This is as unforgivable in a historical novel as failing to develop the characters (a feat which Tuck also manages to accomplish!).  Not only did Tuck do a slap dab job with South American history, her writing was consistently poor.  Long botanical lists which had no relevance to the plot (what little there was), letters, diary entries, which were all meant to provide the reader with verisimilitude, merely slowed down the prose.  Short,almost cartoonish, sexual encounters between undeveloped characters, one-paragraph vignettes, strange graphic violence, all gave a disjointed quality to the prose which made it tempting to skip paragraphs, if not whole pages.  Last, but not least, the author clearly does not speak Spanish.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she employed the services of a native speaker to check her error-ridden manuscript. (And where, pray tell, was her editor?)It was highly irritating to wade through grammar mistakes that a first-year Spanish student could have caught and corrected.  All in all, a highly disappointing read 
 that I even read this book!  Even knowing it's a re-release doesn't help! My sister-in-law and I are avid Plum fans and I guess it will have to suffice to say that we will simply stick to the Plum titles and leave the rest behind.  This book was SO light, I'm surprised it didn't just float away.  I think successful writers should not be so money-hungry that reprinting of old titles becomes the name of the game... JMHO     
 I am disappointed in this book.  I have read 10 of the stories so far.  Each story starts off great and builds into something exciting.  Then each one seems to end abruptly.  So my problem is with the endings.  Each one is worst then the one before.  I would not recommend this book to someone who is starting to read fantasy.  It will disappoint the 
 Don't buy this book.  It wasn't John Sears.  We know now that it was W. Mark Felt, the No. 2 man at the FBI who was the source. 
 Very hard to read and understand. Each chapter has Learning Objectives and those LO's are referenced for the questions at the end. The problem is: inside the chapter there is no way to find out what the LO's are!!! Me and a friend tried to figure it out but it was almost impossible. A lot of the chapter questions were very difficult. Several spelling errors that a sixth grader could have found. I had a Managerial Accounting class twice, once as a prerequisite for my graduate degree and I am taking it now for my MBA. Imagine my horror when I discovered that I was using this same book twice. I hope you never get stuck with this turkey of a book 
    Having read Elizabeth Chadwick's "The Greatest Knight," I set aside my natural preference for male authors when it comes to novels involving war, and read "Falls the Shadow."  While I adored "The Greatest Knight", I find two major problems with S. Penman: she does not do male historical subjects justice, and she is a closet snob.    The first is proven by the fact that fully a third of this novel is set in bed: either in birthing scenes, death scenes or to a lesser degree love-making scenes.  These scenes are obsessively drawn-out in relation to the historical sweep the novel purports to compass.  The point is even more starkly proven by the fact that death scenes and female gossip scenes pre-empt the pivotal time the supposed main protagonist spends crusading in the Holy Land, a time which made Simon de Montfort's name and reputation are made as "The greatest soldier in Christendom."  Not a single scene is set in Outremer where the Crusades took place, nor is any scene even narrated in retrospect.  There are a grand total of two battle scenes in a 500-page novel.  Considering the epoch-shaping battles that took place during de Montfort's lifetime, this is perhaps unforgiveable.    The proof of the second point, that Penman is a closet snob, is well illustrated by the way she has her heroine, Nell, treat an impoverished country priest when he is brought to minister to her in-law, Ellen, who is dying at childbirth.  Prior to the death, Nell threatens the priest with Royal wrath if he doesn't perform sacraments contrary to church doctrine, then, further threateningly exhorts him to lie about the nature of the death, then physical abuses him when he meekly descends the stairs to try to fill his empty stomach in the hall following the death.  This scene, and others, bespeaks a rather nasty personality behind the novel.  This is not the way a Royal would act towards an unfortunate lesser: it is the way a middle-class author with imaginary pretentions to higher rank might behave.    Penman also has an extremely distracting and irritating habit of conspicuously omitting conjunctions.  Example:  "I'd have taken them with me if only I could, hope they'll understand one day."  Extremely awkward, and distracting.  The author is trying too hard to be clever or original and it doesn't work.    All in all, not worth reading when one could have Elizabeth Chadwick instead. 
 Although I've never picked up a Mickey Spillane novel before, I wanted to give him a try. After reading Something's Down There, I have to assume that his earlier works are a lot better, because this book couldn't have built his reputation.  Mako Hooker is a sailor (or is he) who seems to want a quiet retirement in the islands. When a mysterious creature begins attacking boats in the area, he's forced to contend not only with the beast, but a film crew that wants to capture it and some shadows of his own past. The biggest problem with this book is that Spillane doesn't seem to know what he wants this story to be. Sometimes it's a detective story, sometimes a crime drama, sometimes it's a Hollywood farce and sometimes its a godawful monster movie. Hooker is cut right out of the tough guy handbook, as is his love interest, and his sidekick (who, in nearly 300 pages, never stops calling Hooker "sar" despite repeated protests both from the character and the readers to knock of the bad accent) is just plain annoying.  I want to give Spillane another try. Maybe a Mike Hammer book or something. I can't imagine that his normal style is like this -- overwritten, boring and completely without excitement 
 It puzzles me why this book got published in the first place.  Maybe it holds some interest for the digital photography historian who has twenty bucks to throw away.

(Any one of these sites would do, so you don't have to dig among all these sties.)  This book is meant to be a survey of the current crop of digital SLRs.  (Fixed-lens digital cameras are not covered.)  Even though the copyright year is 2005, it's already way out of date.  To be fair, any such book will have little current value as the state of the d-SLR market changes rapidly.  For example, the very important Nikon D70 is NOT covered in this book.  Nor is the smallish but capable Pentax *ist DS.  (The websites I listd above do cover these cameras, in lots of details.)  The omission of the D70 is a HUGE mistake, as that camera is important for being a full-featured d-SLR that sells at a consumer price point (unlike the feature-crippled Canon EOS Digital Rebel).  This book is totally disappointing and holds no value whatsoever 
 The darn thing broke almost immediately.  When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!  What a flimsy piece of crap.  I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again 
 If you release a second edition you need to support a second edition, that includes the publisher's website and the downloadable scripts that go with the book....this book is okay, but who has time to type in all of the sample scripts to learn. For not including the scripts I give it a 2 
 This is a good book on this subject. But, I'd like to suggest a very good source of Persian (Farsi) books on the net: www.iranibook.com & www.iranibookshop.com You will find any Farsi books in this feil 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Why oh why is this in pan and scan only. This is a 2.35:1 framed movie and the well balanced and well composed cinematography is completely ruined on this DVD. About half the movie is missing. I love Joshua Tree but I won't buy this DVD. Artisan must understand this simply won't do. Sadly, the only widescreen version out there is the Japanese Laserdisc. And that's LONG out of print 
 a coffee table book come to life, ridiculously uninvolving writing and acting; you could turn to any chapter in this pretentious take on mid-20th century japan and not suffer any the worse for it. 
 I had read pretty good reviews about this game so I bought it.   I was hoping for something with a little action with an interesting storyline.  What I got was probably the most boring game I have ever played.  - The introduction/prolouge lasts about 7 minutes or so, including the credits.  You cannot break out and move on  - After you set down your PSP and grab a drink, you come back and find that there is one short battle for you to play.  Then you go back to the "story".  The characters have long, annoying conversations and you get to press "X" at the end of each of their sentances.  Again, no way to break out, no in-game menu for you to manage the game.  You have to go through each painfully slow dialog box until the "chapter" is over.  This game is really bad.  Maybe it gets a little more interesting; it is possible that there is actually something for you to do besides watch the characters argue.  It is really slow and it is all about the storyline and the dialog.  There does not appear to be any freeplay.  If you have played this type of game before and you enjoy that style of play, then you might like it.  I was bored and frustrated from the first minute 
 Meanspirited book by a man who acts like he knows the "real" Martha Stewart.  If he did, his book would be authorized.  I am always amazed by writers who are quick to tear apart a successful person but who could never do anything anywhere what that successful person has done.  Martha Stewart came from modest background and by nothing more than her own brain, guts and hard work, built a huge company that employs thousands of people, provides wonderful products.    If she was a man, no one would call her a B****.    You want someone sweet who will bake cookies for you and coddle you, go visit your grandma.  You want someone who is sharp and expects the best, go work for Omnimedia and let Martha be your CEO.  The author of this book is a weasel 
 After priming the board as the instructions indicated...it is still useless.  The chalk actually cuts into the chalkboard so now, my daughter who loved chalk and drawing can't use that side of the easel.  I wouldn't recommend this for anyone if they are looking for a product that does what it is supposed to do.  I wonder if the makers even tried to use it...why would someone make a product that doesn't work and then expect people to buy it...very disappointing 
 I also got this disgusting subscription "invoice" from these jerks. I don't care HOW GOOD A MAGAZINE IS, if someone has to use deceptive, threatening and totally bogus marketing practices to ensnare new subscriptions, their magazine should not be rewarded with anyone's business. I never ordered or got a single issue of their rag. Only a repeating smack in the face via mailbox claiming I am going to be "referred to a collection agency."  KIDS Discover, you will NEVER get a cent out of me. Last time I checked we still live in a land where we don't have to pay for what we never got. If you spent as much time working on a good magazine for kids as you do sending out fake bills, you would have enough subscribers you wouldn't have to Shanghai any new ones with your fraudulent billing scam. 
 Unless you want the Editor's liberal political views SHOVED down your throat, avoid this magazine.  It leans to the left so hard that you have to lie on your side to even read it.  (And no, I am NOT a Republican or Democrat, but an Independent who looks at all sides).  The Editor of this magazine has a huge agenda to get the Democrats back in power, he bashes Bush and the Republican party over the head with a 10-ton hammer on a monthly basis, yet worships eco-phonies like Laurie David and celebrities who want the rest of us to drive eco-friendly cars while they fly the world in their private jets. (I understand Laurie and her friends like Sheryl Crow ARE "trying" to wean themselves off this practice by cutting down on their private jet hopping trips a wee bit and using a huge gas guzzling bus that is criss-crossing the country instead, but that poor Laurie is finding this hard to give up.  What hyprocrites these Hollywood folks are!)  Though I am personally trying to do my bit for the environment, I hate when I read issues like the current "Green" issue where these so called eco-environmentalists really only want us "common people" to make the changes. This used to be a great fashion, entertainment and current event magazine with a lot of in-depth articles, but now it is only a political platform publication.  I now will just throw it away as soon as it arrives when I receive it, until my subscription expires 
 I was very disappointed with this CD.  Dean and Frank sound drunk throughout most of the CD and the audience detracts from the songs 
 This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read in my life. Pointless repetition page after page. This book justifies why some people unfortunately despise reading. In this case, it was like pulling teeth to read this trash. We all KNOW what this book tries to tell us. However, Lunsford feels the need to take a sentence, and expand it into 300000 more saying the exact same thing. Please do not buy this. 
 This was chosen for my mother-in law because of the color. It still heats, but doesn"t control the toasting time. Pop-up toaster have worked well for 50+ years. Adding electronics was a bad idea 
 Great motivator although I got really tired of the ex-husband bashing. Also, there are some serious oversights on her part. Go ahead and eat all the bagels you want. If it works for you, congratulations.  I wonder what new spin she'll put on this stuff for her latest get rich scheme 
 Samuel Jackson, Juliette Binoche...I thought it's gonna be a wonderful movie. To my greatest disappointment this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.  A married mother with three children has an affair with a journalist and yet she's the one to fight for someone rights or to be compassionate about someone. What a non-sense!  Hope the greedy amateurs who created this movie WON some money with this crap movie by LOSING their chance to ever film again! Never ever I will watch a movie with Samuel L. Jackson or Juliette Binoche, again. I'm surprised how did they agree to star in this kind of "movie" that wastes your precious time 
 I can't begin to tell you how dissapointed I am that this new Stephen Chow movie is a [...]. If you like Stephen chow try one of his other movies because it will get you many laughs and save you from much dissapointment.  If Stephen Chow is going to go to all the trouble of creating a movie then why not sell it in a format that will allow his fans to actually Watch the freakin' movie?  I ordered this movie and low and behold...IT DOESNT WORK IN ANY DVD PLAYER.  I don't know about anyone else but when I buy a dvd it isnt for the fancy packaging but for the capability to WATCH the movie. In this case all I got for my money is the fancy packaging. Thanks for nothing VideoAsia 
 I sympathize with the author who is trying to document an underground that is genuine and vibrant. But unfortunately she doesn't make it that way for her readers. I suspect it's because she wasn't there long enough; 4 years in a group house and at a minimum wage job at a record store apparently haven't qualifed her perspective. Her descriptions of eating ramen noodles, dying her hair blue, and sharing a bed with housemates while on multiple forms of drugs just sound adolescent. She was out of what she calls "bohemia" by her mid-twenties. She keeps identifying as "weird" but outside the context of a community of freaks. "Weird" becomes a professional identity.  That said, some of the people she interviews are truly living according to bohemian values, and her interviews offer some insight into their lives. The book also has the advantage of her connections as a journalist to provide interviews with some of the more visible of freaks.  But she misses out on the opportunity to really think hard about the complications of bohemia, about issues of class and also, how education impacts someone's social status within society, gentrification and our changing urban centers, and the cooptation of underground aesthetics by mass advertising, especially directed at young people.  Personally, I think she's watching too much TV in that Brooklyn condo of hers. But, then, watching MTV has become part of her job.  Too bad, because it'd be really cool if someone else could do a good job on this theme 
 This looks to be an excellent book, but I strongly recomend you buy it somewhere other than Amazon  (unless you have 4-6 weeks to wait) I ordered it as a gift more than a month ago and have yet to get it.  The other book I ordered with it finally arrived sans the gift wrapping I opted for.  Well, at least IT came 
 I ordered these over a month ago, and Amazon still hasn't shipped them.  Be careful if you need them soon.  I have spoken with customer service at least 5 times, and have not gotten a straight story 
 The high reviews for this album surprise me, as a lot of what is on this CD is pop music with subtle celtic undertones. Now, not all of it is poorly done, as there are a few nice songs. However, on whole, this is nothing to rave about.  A FAR better choice (though somewhat subdued) is Celtic Voices: Women of Song. (I understand some people don't like this review, but I would LOVE to know how "You Raise Me Up" is in anyway celtic? 
 I wasn't impressed by his jazz style on this CD.  I really liked another of his discs - that's why I tried this one 
 Let me start by saying that I loved the first four books.  I am deeply attached to the characters, universe and overall storyline.  However,  I have no words for how poorly I received this book.  I suffered though most of the book before reaching the semi-satisfying conclusion.  I first came near to giving up at the beginning of the book when I was introduced to a monster chicken.  But, I got past that and moved forward.  Then, there was the large portions of the book dedicated to characters and places I have never met and have no connection to.  But, I carried on until we got back to the people I "know."  The last time that I slammed the book closed was after reading a short scene told through the perspective of a horse.  Not a magic horse, mind you, but an ordinary beast of burden.  Finally, if you make it through all that, the ending is somewhat satisfying relative to the rest of the novel, but I can't see how it can be important in the overall Sword of Truth series.  It also doesn't help that the book seems choppy and poorly edited.  My recommendation:  Just skip this one go to the next 
 1995 edition with 1970's figures and automobiles.  Classiclly, this has been an architectural resource book for any office doing presentation work, though, today the content is dated 
 From all the incredible reviews for this book, I really thought this would solve all my questions in trying to learn how to write believable characters. It didn't. This book wasn't very helpful at all. Over and over the author says stuff like this about creating characters - "you must be able to lay down their motivation and make their behavior realistic. You need to make them consistent in personality so they'll be believable. You must build their backstory by understanding their childhood" (p. 188). She tells us over and over that You MUST, You MUST, You MUST, but she doesn't explain HOW.   If you want long (and I mean interminably long) pages of descriptions of what neurotics or addicts or psychos or people with rotten childhoods or abused people are like, the whole 2nd half of the book is full of those facts. But that's the trouble-- it's just a lot of facts. She never discusses HOW to use those facts (most of which we could glean from TV) to build real-life story people.   To make things worse, I found none of the exercises to be in the slightest bit useful. "What emotions have your characters suppressed? What traumatic events or crises happened to your character in the past? How did you character act out his repressed emotions? Write a scene answering the above questions" (p. 120). Over and over asking a bunch of questions, then telling an author-in-training to write a scene isn't an EXERCISE! I know the answers to those questions. I want to know how to make the character clear on the page - not just in my head.  By the second half of this book, I just hated this book and felt cheated that it didn't provide anything useful for actually creating characters, so I was vastly disappointed. I did read through to the end, and even there the reader is cheated. There is no wrap-up, no final summary, no list of resources, nothing. The book ends abruptly after chapter 11 while talking about "Looks Can Be Deceiving." Truer words were never spoken. The look of this book completely deceived me 
 ...don't buy this CD.  Most of this is emo, and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy.  There are a few good bands on this CD--enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice, but it's not worth your time if you're an actual punk fan.  It has an interesting mix of music, but it doesn't fit together too well.  The upsides to this compilation are as follows:  one, the Dropkick Murphys song, and two, it's inexpensive.  However, it's even less expensive to just forget about buying this CD at all 
 What is Zionism and why must it be critiqued.  This book is addressing the latter, but we must address both.  Zionism is a nationaist idea coming from the late 19th century.  It is nationalist and religious and secular(one of many ironies) and embraces the Jewish people's quest for a nation.  We must view it as we view pan-Turkism.  pan-Tukism views the Turks as a people, but the Turks are also Muslim, thus it encompasses religion and nation. Jews are basically the same, a nation wrapped inside a religion, like all old tribal religions used to be and like Hindu Nationalism is today, and we might at Japan is.  Zionism was socialist.  It looked for a land, originally Uganda, and then Israel, which shoes just how unreligious it originally was, since it didnt see Israel as essential.  In Israel is did suprisingly well and like most national movements it envisioned a 'greater' version of the homeland, like 'greater' Greece or 'greater' Serbia, or Ukraine.  The critique is that it doenst have clean hands.  Most ideologies dont.  Ideology and its affects are not two in the same.  COmmunism isnt inherently evil, but it is responsible for evil.    However the contemporary critique of zionism is decidedly a left wing communist view that nation doesnt matter.  But then COmmunism died and so did Zionism.  Zionism and its ideals died long ago.  So why is this book trying to put a new spin on it?  Most likely what we are seeing here is an appeasment of the international media, the neo-nazi and the islamist obsession with 'zionists'.  However zionists dont exist.  It is a red herring, like those who used to find communist conspiracies everywhere.  This book is outdated and lacks percpective.  Seth J. Frantzma 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 This book lives up to NONE of its promises.  The author apparently has a tin tongue - ie can't taste anything - because he says things like (to paraphrase)"there are perfectly good low-calorie substitutes for everything you may want to eat".  Have you ever tried nonfat cheese?  The foods he recommends are dreadful.  I stuck it out though, for his recommended 10 days and was very hungry the whole time.  I followed his advice to the letter and only lost a few pounds, which came back in less than a week.  I can't beleive this guy gets paid to give advice 
 Every section of this book gives great plans for having fun in your neighborhood. I live in an area that already has scheduled events, but this gives many more ideas for other opportunities to involve those not already involved. I also like the sections on what to do when someone moves into your neighborhood, has a prolonged illness, or if someone dies... it give many good ideas on meals or practical things to do 
 This toy is the most stupidest thing i have ever had. The only reason why i gave it a one is because you couldn't give it a zero. First of all this thing beeps every five seconds. I swear even when im sleeping this thing beeps. It wsn't always like that when i got it i would bring it to school then everyone started getting one even kindergarners had one then the princble banned them because one third grader lost hers. During class kids would ask me do you want to connect? Im just saying this is a toy for little ones. This toy can also get repetative i mean its a baby then it gets a tooth ache toddler teen adult old person. So parents if your thining about buying this toy for your children dont because in about a month and a half they would probably stop using it. So dont buy it 
 I didn't hear the CD for some reason so I can not tell you what I think about it. Sorry 
 This is a cheap made in asia transfer to DVD, certainly not worth the price. Advertised subtittles are not included.  I wonder if MGM is aware of that release and if their copyrights were properly protected. I would suggest that Amazon take this item off their catalog. Conclusion: don't get fooled, don't buy! 
 Nickel Creek fans, obviously, will love this syrupy solo album by the guitarist of the aforementioned famed popgrass fusion band.  Presumably this mostly-instrumental outing is intended to demonstrate Watkins' chops as a picker, yet it follows so closely in the saccharine tradition of Nickel Creek that it doesn't do much to differentiate his work from theirs.  The album opens with "Neo's Song," which sounds like a watered-down version of Tony Rice's note-bending flatpicking style; the rest of the album gets progressively muzak-ier and Windham Hill-ish.  Watkins has lots of technical facility, but his artistic instincts are hopelessly bland 
 This item is just to expensive for what it does.  If it were priced at about $125.00 USD I would say okay.  I'm going to return the one I bought asap 
 The book was informative, however it lacked a certain sophistication which left many questions unanswered. Not enough time dedicated to flowers 
 I've been a Beastie Boys fan since I was in 8 years old. I played the cassette version of License to Ill until it did nothing but make a squealing sound in my head phones. And until a while ago I would maintain to anyone that EVERY Beastie Boys album was great, cool in its own right and an evolutionary step forward by some of hip hop's most talented artists. (Get to the point. I know, I know.) But I had never really owned "Hello Nasty' myself. It was the only one of their albums I hadn't picked upon release. Until recently.  Now, upon closer inspection reveals that there really isn't a stand out track on the whole album. "Intergalactic," "Body Movin'" and "Super Disco Breakin'" may have been pseudo hits but they don't really stand out from the rest of the album, which feels like mostly filler. Decent filler, though. There are a few stinkers: "Song for the Man" (It's cool when they try to do new things and the lyrics are interesting, but this track is utterly skippable) and Dedication (following House of Pain's shout out track lead is indulgent and just plain boring to listen to).  Like their previous two LPs, there are a few decent instrumental track that break up the album. But in general the whole album seems to pass unnoticed. I listened to it 4 times in a row while at work an couldn't really discern any standout track. But for what it's worth, I wasn't annoyed.   All in all it's cool to hear the B-Boys make a cohesive album with a unique sound, but it's not mind blowing. I'd recommend it for serious fans and people collecting all their CDs. It's certainly won't detract from your collection and there will be a time you'll want to listen to it. But I wouldn't expect to find yourself picking it over Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head or even To The 5 Boroughs (awesome, by the way) for that matter. 
 There is nothing majorly wrong with this game.  The plot is well-developed, the characters are customizable, and the battles are strategic.  This is probably primarily subjective, but I just didn't enjoy this game.  It's not because there were too many movies--it's because I didn't like the movie.  I also didn't like the characters or the villains or for that matter the aesthetics.  There were some minor but annoying flaws in the game which further contributed to my displeasure.  Which button to press was often counterintuitive, and so I often found myself pressing the wrong button.  Also, the game badly needs a journal and/or a destination guide so you know where to go--I once spent one hour doing nothing other than walking around a space ship trying to figure out where to go 
 The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness 
 Poorly done. Read Publisher Weekly's review from above, they are right on, but a little too nice. It's amazing what gets past editors' desks - the dialogue is so cheesy, even young adults should be insulted 
 This CD is remixed and edited to the point where most of the songs are choppy and the music drowns out the voices. This happens especially with Tony Braxton's Unbreak My Heart - though this is one of the most enjoyable remixes.  Also, there's a monotone quality to the rhythm and flow that becomes tedius quickly.  I expected to find Duran Duran's Sunrise to be simply a toss-in filler, but it's quite good. And Dido's White Flag is wonderfully done- though cut a bit short.  The remainder went under "Disable Selected Tracks" -- a lot of divas caterwauling through some of the dumbest lyrics I've ever had to struggle to hear. Alice Keys featuring Tony! Toni! Tone'! and Diary reaches new highs for repetitive drivel.  A waste of money.      
 this book is so deeply biased and prejudiced against its main subject (Werner Heisenberg) that it cannot be taken seriously even for the few relevant things it has to say. Moreover the author is so aggressive (almost violent)against what he calls "german culture" (this label already suggests a lot) that his criticism borders on cultural racism. I deeply regret the time and money I spent in reading and buying this book 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 A very misleading title -- certainly not "definitive" and it's not for all climbers. It's an okay book if you're only interested in sport climbing and bouldering. Not very useful for alpinists, ice climbers, ski mountaineers, peak baggers or just being in shape for occasional weekend rockclimbs. Be very careful with some of his advice if you're over 30 since it's mostly written for younger climbers who recover quickly. Now that "Self-Coached Climber" is out, this book is even less valuable 
 After they butchered version of the Smith's "frankly mr shankly" I know I shouldn't have given this band a chance. Total waste of mone 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 This is basically a 1/8" male to RCA cable for $73; you could get the same exact cable for $5.99 at Radio Shack.  Yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out; not worth it.  Buy the cable at RS; it'll work EXACTLY the same.. don't be fooled.  If you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately; you'll save major $$$.. 
 Daniel Martin is in love with his vision of the world but in all honesty he is so self-absorbed that all of these experiences seem trivial and removed.And the female characters are like soulless machines,used for pleasure and then written off.I was waiting for a smartass kid to come along and make fun of Daniel Martin's brazen attitude or at least his shoes 
 This is a cute title, but the suggestions in this book, as illustrated  above, pretty much range from silly to absurd.  It's like a greeting card  you read once and throw away. If you're looking for games to play with your  baby or ways to stimulate him mentally, look elsewhere.  If you're so  completely unimaginative that you can't make a funny face without reading  instructions, look no further ; 
 There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation.  So just how different are they?  Not as different as you might imagine--but as different as art and exploitation.  "The Virgin Spring" is easily one of Bergman's most accessible films.  Telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion, he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren't accustomed to seeing.  A young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy.  Though they initially seem helpful, their actions quickly become violent.  After a graphic (for the time) rape, the girl is murdered.  Later, the wrongdoers happen upon the girl's home and seek shelter from her family--both groups unaware of who the other is.  Suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought.  It is a powerful tale of love, loss and the depths people can be driven into--where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code, where savagery and rage take over.  Bergman's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by Max von Sydow as the father.  Real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen.  Add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it's a winning combination.  But what endures in the story of "The Virgin Spring" is how strong a component faith becomes--when there is nothing left to believe in, can you still believe?  A classic in every sense, "The Virgin Spring" still has the power to shock but there's something very redemptive about the film.  "Last House on the Left," however, is probably more notorious than acclaimed.  The plot, as I've said, is identical.  Coming 12 years later, in 1972, Wes Craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale.  It is a shocker, and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the "torture cinema" of today.  It is brutal, uncompromising and graphic--and the film was championed in the underground horror market.  Working with a small budget, the film lacks the artistry of "The Virgin Spring."  While it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock--what it lacks is depth and subtlety.  The characters aren't particularly drawn out so their actions don't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film.  Without contemplating faith and moral choices, what we're left with is straightforward revenge.  And the film, ultimately, has no redemption--no uplift.  It's violence for the sake of violence.  It remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it's own right.     And therein lies the difference between art and exploitation.   KGHarris, 11/06 
 If only the person who put together the soundtrack for final release was half as intelligent as the genius charlie kaufman.  The ORIGINAL soundtrack is great especially the track "adaptation" during the closing scene and credits.  But on this CD its only a tedious remix by fatboy? slim? What a joke 
  Hi kids!  I'm Methyl Mercaptan, the ingredient in flatulence that makes it smell.  I reside deep within Mike Savage's cranium, being created by anaerobic bacteria that's busy decomposing whatever remains within his brain cavity.  We call Mike's comfy cranium the turd world.  Whenever Mike opens his mouth a little bit of me escapes, but don't worry because Mike keeps making more.  Whenever he exhales near an open flame he inexplicably is wearing his double-wide pants on his head, and when they catch fire you can yell "Liar, liar, pants on fire".  As for his art, he doesn't do his shambolic girth justice:  There isn't a seismograph in the country that doesn't have a restraining order against a guy so fat that he displaces more water than a battleship.  Well, I have to go now.  Mike just found an image of the Virgin Mary in his freedom fries, and he's about to giggle with girlish glee.  See ya real soon 
 Hindsight is always 20/20. People critical of the New Deal have no idea of the fear and hopelessness that the average American was facing in the 1930s. The New Deal/Roosevelt were not without flaws, but look at our modern response to  war and natural disasters. Seventy years later people are still affected by the depression. This author of this book needs to loose his life savings and go hungry before being critical of  the New Dealers. 
 Seriously.  Homer wasn't all that, and I'm so thankful to Amazon.com to allow me to give it only two stars.   Homer's boring, and he's totally overrated.  He's always using the same lines- "bit the dust", "rosy-fingered dawn", "the wine-dark sea", "night filled his eyes", "Achilles swift of foot"- Homer needs to be more original.  And what's with the one name- "Homer"- who does he think he is, Madonna 
 Disappointing.  Our heroine spends 300 pages convinced her mother (as sane as any wealthy Texas matron) is crazy.  Not believable even in the pretend world.  I was looking forward to this third outing of Ms. Kendricks but had to keep reading faster to not put it down completely.  Surely #4 will be back on track.   
 I found the story of Alan Turing's life to be very interesting. His original work on dreaming up a "thinking machine" that would eventually become what we know as a computer and his work on breaking the German "enigma" code are worth knowing about. His tragic end is cause for us all to remember the importance of tolerance. However, I found this book to be too long and detailed for my tastes. I think the story could have been told in one half or one third the space. So I would recommend that anyone interested in the history of science read a biography of Turing, but a different one than this book 
 I have read all of Nelson Demille's books and have enjoyed every single one thoroughly. Infact I started reading this book at 9am this morning, and honestly could not set it down for more than 5 minutes, before I HAD to pick it up and see what was going to happen next. Well the book was awesome all the way up until the last 5 pages. I have never, ever, ever seen a book end as bad as this. EVER. Even books that are not that good thoughout the whole thing, most of the time won't let you down like this at the end. I seriously threw the book in the garbage 5 seconds after reading the last paragraph.  I have never in my life felt this let down by a book, it will definately be the last Demille book I read.  If you have ever seen the movie Rudy, imagine watching that, then its the very last game, his family is there, waiting and watching, and all of a sudden they just stop the game for no reason and the movie ends 
 My son ONLY asked for this for Christmas, so I had to get it.  It doesn't do much -- he was bored with it within a few days.  It shoots the harmless "bullets" pretty far, but not easily aimed.  The pincher on our first one didn't work so we had to send it back for a replacement.  Pincher STILL isn't very strong & basically just pushes things around rather than carry them -- it doesn't "lift" objects, just grabs them & drags them around--and you have to hold a button continuously to hold the object.    And LOUD -- VERY LOUD -- the legs hit the floor VERY hard (though I haven't noticed any scratches on the floor).  We have a small house & you can hear the bug from one end to the other.  I would NOT buy this again. There are MUCH more interactive RC toys out there 
 Nancy Appleton has clearly declared her personal agenda against sugar, but her lack of objectivity, organization, credibility, or substance leave much to be desired in this book.  I was frustrated by the constant repetition throughout the text, and I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time to find any new information.  In addition, I was hoping to find concrete, applicable suggestions on HOW to kick the sugar habit.  While Dr. Appleton does attempt to include "food plans," they are simply lists of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I do NOT recommend this book to others 
 CAUTION: This book may fool you. I have one word for it: *hisssssssssssss*. It looks like a nice Wiccan book BUT IT"S NOT. Witches, beware! It is for biased Christians so they can just convert people who believe in an earthbound religion with a goddess. Listen. Trying to covert someone is bad. Not everyone can believe the same thing as you. Wiccans have not been harming Christians, so who gave Christians the right to convert Wiccans? Wiccans don't believe in Satan! Satan was invented by the Christians. Satan is not real! Don't accuse peace-loving people of believing in him 
 I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails 
 Not worth it. Weight fluctuates daily 3-5 pounds. Accuracy is questionable 
 use less than 3 times, the touch screen doesn't work.don't know why~ 
 Why would anyone buy this edition - it's outdated. There is a newer edition with a lot more current material and it has over 50 pages more text. See isbn 1880410273 for the second edition of this title. That newer edition deserves all the compliments mentioned above and below for this edition 
 This book could have probably been half as long as it is if he'd stick to snakes and things pertaining to them.  There was much "historical" information setting up a chapter that just went on and on for pages with little-if any-mention of snakes.  The stories that actually DID involve serpents were usually quite interesting, but the format mentioned in other reviews about each story being broken up and scattered around the book was really annoying.  This one took me a longer time to finish than I wanted.  I hoped for venomous snakes, but it fell far short of my expectaion.  See if a library has it before spending money on it 
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 Are the other reviewers here reading the same book I am, or are they friends of the author?  The poor quality of this book is too glaring to avoid.   An honest reader has to wonder if it is self-published. (OK, AMACOM appears not to be a vanity press, but a Scribners it ain't.)  Pelfrey is sometimes good at narrative, but after doing his cut-and-paste work, did he bother to read the finished product?  We are ceaselessly flailed with redundant information.  How many times do we need to know that Alfred Sloan's memoir was ghostwritten by a committee of 20?  How many times do we need to know of Billy Durant's mother's Mayflower connection?  How many times do we need to be told that Durant was a strong supporter of Prohibition and the Eighteenth Amendment?  How many times do we need it driven home that Billy Durant was mercurial and that Alfred Sloan was stolid?  How many times do we need reminding that General Motors became the greatest enterprise in corporate history?  All of this is repeated as if for the first time.  And all of this in the first 30 pages!    Is this just sloppy or non-existent editing, or is it padding?  For no apparent reason, where we would expect a series of sentences heading paragraphs, we are given a bulleted list.  Since when does a book that "reads like a novel" have bulleted lists?  I keep hoping that the repetition will taper off, that I'll no longer be subjected to gratuitously sensationalistic passages like, "Raised by a socialite divorcee in an era when single mothers were scorned," or awkward transitions like "...Durant was high on the list of Flint's most elegible bachelors.  He married Clara Pitt...."  I hope the story of Durant's first job, in his family's lumberyard, which Pelfrey (or rather the source he quotes) begins in intimate detail, will be rescued from the oblivion to which it's assigned a paragraph later.  But I won't hold my breath.  I suggest that, instead of heeding the misleading reviews here, you catch the author's talk on BookTv.  It tells you everything the book does, but mercifully only once.  
 If you are interested in learning about the *actual* science of food, but don't want to learn any science, at least read a book by someone who *did* learn it.  There is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely.  "Oil is more dense than water-- and that's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212".  As a chemist and formulator I can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water, and even if it weren't that's *not* the reason it has a higher boiling point.  Ever make oil & vinegar salad dressing?  Ever seen crude oil on the ocean?  How about the funk on top of old greasy dish water?  Folks, oil floats on water... and the earth is not flat.  Either this guy is a complete moron, or he is a very clever con artist.  Either way, save your money... and buy that blind Amish author's book "Semiconductor Microengineering for Dummies" instead.  It's better researched 
 Only five animals spotlighted. No explanation of orientation i.e. dorsal.  No explanation of what is depicted, especially maddening with certain cross sections. The art is uniform, clean, and attractive.  The attention to each animal is not identical, i.e. ones mouth is highlighted in depth while others are not 
 Don't waste your money on this book - just reread  Make the connectio 
 How very disappointed I was with this reading.  It became a chore and I made myself finish it.  How sad since Mr. Bourdain is so talented with his writing and humor.  Don't bother.  He has become too big for his book binder/britches 
 For the most part, I found this book to be very disappointing. I had a hard time getting through the book and didn't really feel like I learned much of anything. I also feel that the title is very misleading. I bought this book expecting to learn about about walking in the Spirit/being led by the Spirit. But this book devotes only a single chapter to those subjects. Another concern I had about this book is that I felt it wasn't biblically based. My recommendation is to skip this book. A much better book on this subject is "Grace Walk" by Steve McVe 
 Dang, I just love knitting books and own too many. So whenever something that looks potentially hip comes out I get all excited. I try to check  books out before ordering online, and I'm so glad I did. Be warned. This is not a knitting pattern book. This is instead what the call is design Circus layout. There are lots of pictures and quotes and tidbids etc. It's a small book that seems like one of those gifty "Why friends are great" kind of books. I suppose if you like reading about knitting culture and not actually knitting this is your book and could maybe go along in some sort of knitting care package, but otherwise I don't get it. I suppose it has some redeeming qualities, but if you want something cute or kitschy with actual patterns check out Mason-Dixon, Stitch 'n Bitch or Alterknits. 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once) I Have never left a series  unfinished I am leaving my third decade I have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly. I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.  I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well.   Shame 
 This book lacked a lot of focus in what it wanted to accomplish.  Was it trying to give tips on how to win at Monopoly or trying to show how the game teaches lessons to be applied to real life?  In both cases, it came up lacking.  The tips it gave were rather common-sensical, the stories it shared didn't really give any insight into how the game applies to business, and to top it off, it didn't not give accurate rules to the game.  For example, the book said that you couldn't collect rent while in jail, so you should always try to stay out of jail and in the game, just like in life.  That's a nice maxim to live by, but you CAN collect rent while in jail and every good business person knows that there are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative.  Overall, the book was very disappointing and I hope only to spare others from making the same mistake of wasting time reading it 
 Unfortunately, it seems to be an increasingly popular trend today to try and destroy the reputations of deceased screen legends who can no longer defend themselves. This is certainly not the first of its kind, and it's obviously not the last either (too bad!). This book has many brief chapters, each one filled with the worst scandals (abortions, adulterous affairs, criminal activities, etc.) of a specific female screen legend, such as Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, Lana Turner, Judy Garland, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly. Elizabeth Taylor, Hedy Lamarr, and several others.   The sections on Lana Turner, Greta Garbo, and Hedy Lamaar were especially infuriating, filled with rumors that even the National Enquirer would hesitate to print. For example, according to this book, Mickey Rooney and Lana Turner had an affair in the late 1930's which resulted in Lana having an abortion. Lana Turner already denied this rumor, and the very idea of a beautiful goddess like Lana Turner going for baby-faced Mickey Rooney is, quite frankly, disgusting and totally unbelievable. It also hints strongly that she had an affair with Clark Gable, although in her memoir she wrote that they had no chemistry off-screen. While some may find this kind of book entertaining, I think it's in poor taste. The book also describes Hedy Lamarr's orgies and bi-sexual relationships, and basically tries to pass her off as an arrogant nymphomaniac (the author does the same thing with Garbo).  This book quickly summarizes the screen careers and lives of these great actresses yet goes into great detail about their sexual activity (and preferences). Don't be too naive when reading about the many imperfections of these famous actresses. After all, there is some truth to many of the scandals mentioned, but there are also plenty of rumors that no one could posibly prove to be true. And after all, the author is merely rehashing what you've already read in previous books written by better authors. I suggest that instead of reading this trash you buy a well-researched biography. 
 This is the required text for my course. I've read it thoroughly and it seems great, but it definitely is not getting me the grade I want.  I'm buying a different textbook to supplement 
 Wolff began teaching a political science course, believing that government was justified. He wasn't too sure just *how* it could be justified, so he promised his students that he would find out by the end of the term. What  he found out was that all arguments that attempt to justify government are  flawed, and that moral autonomy requires anarchy. He does a good job  presenting this argument, but his reliance on Kant's conceptions seems to  me to make it of rather limited value, since most individuals do not find  Kant persuasive. Even for someone interested in anarchism, Wolff's book is  at best aleatory material 
 The movie is fine, but............... There is no mention in the description that this is a widescreen format. I use full screen. When I contacted amazon to find if it was available in full screen, the response was send it back if you don't want it. I kept it, but was not happy with customer service 
 The author gets way of course on various subjects. The book, in my opinion, is a bore. I have read several publications on area 51 and this book was a real struggle. Very little substance and a lot of hype. I couldn't finish it. The silly cover should have tipped me off.. 
 I purchased this movie from amazon because of the online reviews. This film is terrible. Bad acting, directing, and poor editing... there is a scene where you can see truck tire tracks in the sand. Tomas Milan seems to have little concern about anything that is going on around him. I have no Idea how this trash achieved such a cult following.  I own a large number of spagetti westerns and this one is by far the worst. Even for the 60's this is a bad film.. period 
 I spent a very intimate month with this score when I understudied the role of Despina. The score is rife with misprints. There are misprints with text, notes, and rhythms. Learning any role from this score will result in the inevitable relearning of certain areas of the music and text. If you can, get yourself to a Barenreiter copy. It is considerably more expensive, but the product is immensely superb and will be entirely accurate to the signed Mozart score. The only thing that is good about this score is its availability. The product, however, is not good. During rehearsals we would keep a tally of how many mistakes we could find--"Chalk one up for Mr. Schirmer!" 
 The writing is good from a technical standpoint (I don't have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well).  The idea is a good one too.  What I can't get past is the character Robert Langdon.  Langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second.  Another thing I have trouble with is Dan Brown's knack for slowing the pace of the story.  Things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense.  The problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff.  Like playing fetch with a dog, you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest, especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it's finally tossed.    This book is an easy read but I think it is a bit over-rated.  
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 WARNING: The album version of "Maneater" meanders and stalls-out after less than 3 minutes (at what I would consider the song's climax), descending into over a minute and a half of nearly a cappella vocals, instrumental breakdowns, and ad-libs by Timbaland; the track concludes with several seconds of studio dialog.  "Loose" is another frustrating example of an album that does not include the same version of the song heard on the radio or in the video.  LOOSE consists of 13 songs, two of which are versions of "Te Busque".  Most of the songs are produced by Timbaland.  Booklet does not include lyrics.    The album is listen-able, and while the percussion-based "No Hay Igual" is interesting, other than the poorly edited "Maneater" and the over-played "Promiscuous", there are no stand-out tracks. 
 The information gets 4 stars, but the writing style put me to sleep, so that gets a 1.  I'm just settling on giving it a 2.  
 I thought this book had to be the worst book I've ever read.  Within the first chapter I was already angry at myself for not taking the time to read a couple of pages before I purchased it.  This book is about Sirena and Regan, two pirates who begin as enemies but then become lovers.  Tragedy strikes the lovers when their son, Mikel dies.  Sirena is unable to handle the loss of their son and turns away from Regan.  Regan in turn flees to England, divorces Sirena, and then becomes engaged to a younger woman.  Sirena follows him, proclaims her love but Regan will not take her back.  She then in turn marries the younger woman's father so that Regan will not get the woman's money.  They both end up looking like fools and in the end are brought back together to fight a foe from the past.  The character, Sirena, is supposed to be a strong willed female who is smart enough and brave enough to rule a whole ship of men however, she lets a smooth talking pedifile to snare her into marriage.  She then allows him to rape and demean her.  Regan, who is supposed to be strong, brave, and totally in love with Sirena, divorces Sirene shortly after arriving in England then prosceeds to invest all her money and become engaged to another woman.  When Sirena arrives in England proclaiming her love for him he refuses to take her back.  They instead physically and verbally fight each other.  Proclaiming their hatred for one another.  I was sadly disappointed in this book and am not sure at all if I will be giving the author another try 
 The Soviet film "100 Days Before the Command" is the tale of the fate of a handful of raw young recruits who attempt to retain their humanity in a bleak, senseless, brutal militaristic culture. The film blends moments of brutality--a drunken officer returning at night and urinating on the face of a sleeping recruit, for example--with endless nude scenes. The director, Hussein Erkenov, states that the inclusion of nudity was a deliberate action aimed to show the recruits' vulnerability and innocence. Well, I can buy that, I suppose--the naked shower scenes, the sprawled, tangled half-naked bodies in the abandoned woodshed, and the prolonged soapy rub-downs etc do invoke a certain ethereal 'lost boys' quality (think Hylas and the Nymphs--but the nymphs are all male). However, after wrestling with the possibility that perhaps this film wasn't set in a basic training camp for recruits after all, but instead was perhaps a nudist colony, I was still left with a dull feature, sparse dialogue and quixotic editing. In Russian with English subtitles--displacedhuma 
 I randomly chose to buy and listen to this CD because they are playing at Coachella.  It isn't good.  It reminds me of StereoLab but without talent.  Each song is more insipid and boring than the last.  The music is an unfortunate combination of beats from a dated drum machine, irritating electonic blips, guitar for beginners and vocal stylings that are wimpy and heartless.  Needless to say...I don't get it 
 The plot to this story was extremely boring with a very weak mystery.  The characters were unbelievable and not very likable.  Was difficult to even finsh the book 
 At less than a dollar per sparkly Frisbee, this is the best price I can find for Frisbees. They don't fly very well and they break relatively easily, but this is the best value I can find for 100 Frisbees in one place.  A lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable CD media. The problem with that is, they don't work very well for that either. I, too, tested this for myself.  Using Nero Burning ROM, I tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs -=AT 4X=-, just like you're supposed to. IT WORKED! It burned fine. Then it took 5 minutes to open a simple HTML document on the burned disc. Subsequent trials run with the "Verify Written Data" checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning. It's like writing with a white crayon, except this is white paper. This persisted on several OTHER computers with different CD burner drives and even different software.  I finally realized what great Frisbees these things are. Cheer up people: THEY ARE GREAT FUN! So grab your spindle, go outside, and start chucking these things at your neighbor's annoying dog.  PS. I need to sue Memorex for selling this junk. These disc are just a form of abuse 
     There is not a lot of substance to this book.  Basically, this is Bill Shanks snubbing his nose at Moneyball, and not much else.  It is good for the anecdotes about the players, especially thus far into the 2005 season, and seeing some of the guys he talks about finding success with the Braves Major League club.  But, my praise ends here.      There are also many, indeed too many, anecdotes regarding various front office staff linked to the Braves organization. The latter 100 pages of this book devolves into the following rote format:  "(INsert name of obscure managerial staff remotely linked to the Braves organization) learned everything from (insert name of current senior managerial staff in Braves organization).  XXXX talked with YYYYY and agrees, makeup is everything.  Thanks to YYYYY, XXXXX drafted (insert name of unproven minor league prospect here) who is a great talent.  XXXX, by filling up his minor league system with raw, toolsy players, has been able to load his team with old has-beens and never-wases through making trades with other gambling addict GM's, in order to make an ill-advised, premature, and ultimately unsuccessful push for the playoffs.  Take that Billy Beane!"  Seriously, it's like Shanks clicked 'copy' on his word processor and pasted the same story over and over again, changing only the names and locations to protect the innocent.   The point he strives to get across, and which is repeated incessantly, is that the "makeup" separates would-be MLB'ers from career burger flippers. If you want to hear more calls for "makeup" than at clown college, this book is for you.  If you want to hear an actual argument as to what makeup is, or how the Braves can find it when no one else can, or some other proof, you will be disappointed.  My impression is that, without any basis whatsover for his beliefs, Bill Shanks sat down to write a book about how silly Billy Beane is for drafting his college players and hiding in his statistics, and how foolish Moneyball followers are for believing in the hocus pocus that is mathematics (that's something out of Harry Potter is it not?).  He then went around and dumped every shred of evidence he could find that he was correct into this book.  I hate to spoil the ending, but he comes off looking foolish.  He has no idea why the Braves are good, and presents no basis for his disdain of statistics.   AS a side note, that Jeremy Bonderman fellow, who pitches so well for the Tigers, was drafted out of high school by a very successful organization.  He was then traded to flesh out a need on the major league club.  Drafted by Atlanta, right?  Wrong. He was drafted by Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics.  Bonderman completely refutes Shanks' entire argument, if you think about it.     
 as usual, michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours. theres alot of great stuff here (the interview w marilyn manson, the interview w trey parker, &c), but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling, no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston. i agree with many, nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution. 
 Aries Spears is cool, but I guess that I set my expectations too high for this one...I should have bought "I Ain't Scared" instead...I'll be selling this one immediately 
 I would not recommend this book.  It barely skims the surface of what you really need to know to become proficient with SQL Server 2000.  The book also contains numerous, and I mean numerous, typos, mistakes and incorrect code that will not work 
 Reading the reviews for this book I thought it would be a more substantial book than what I found.  It is a cute idea, but it is lacking in content.  Very disappointed...will probably end up as a garage sale book 
 This is what the jaundiced Gould reader has come to expect: lively writing about interesting bits of natural history combined with dubious science, a clutter of pet hobbyhorses and the deconstruction & ridicule of a scientist whom Gould considers to be politically/socially incorrect.  The subject this time is Charles Dolittle Walcott, the discoverer of the Burgess Shale.  One may argue that Gould says some nice things about him, but some of them are by way of arguing that Walcott couldn't have made an honest mistake and must have been deluded.  On the whole, I am reminded of the experienced Senator's advice to call a foolish opponent "My learned and distinguished colleague."  I find Gould tiresome, but since I keep coming across criticisms of him in other sources, I feel that I should read his original words before judging him.  I have yet to think that any of his critics was being unfair.  I recommend reading Daniel Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea, especially the chapter "Bully for Brontosaurus" in which he reviews Gould's body of work.  It is easier to ask this now that the classifications done by Harry Whittington, Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris (hereafter W, B & CM) have been revised to something more like Walcott's, but why does Gould so readily assume that Walcott was wrong, and was wrong because of his psychology?  Given that Walcott apparently labelled his work as preliminary, and W, B & CM have the advantage of more specimans, and well as decades of improved techniques and further research, why assume that Walcott's family life affected his classifications?  And if Gould wants to maintain that one's political/social/psychological traits affect one's work, why doesn't he feel the need to vet W, B & CM?  Many of Gould's critics would agree that those traits can affect one's thinking, and would hold up one Stephen Jay Gould as a prime example.  Did Gould take his own biases into consideration in writing this book?  I ask the reader's indulgence if this paragraph is dull, but I am following Gould's lead, and this is something that he does a lot.  Gould spends pages fretting over insignificant inconsistencies between Charles Schuchert's 1928 obituary of Walcott and Walcott's diary.  Schuchert says that it was beginning to snow at the end of the Walcotts' 1909 field season, whereas Walcott's diary says that the weather was beautiful.  I think that it is a bit unreasonable to expect Walcott to rise up out of his grave to contradict Schuchert, especially since it makes no difference whether it was raining, snowing, or the sun was shining.  Further, Schuchert could be considered accurate if it had begun to snow in the Canadian Rockies, whether or not it was actually snowing on the Walcotts, or because he was being somewhat metaphorical, and meant only to indicate that it was the time of year when it begins to snow there, and therefore the season has to come to an end for safety's sake, even if exciting discoveries are being made.   Unfortunately, this sort of one-track literalism or failure to consider alternate and sometimes more obvious meanings pervades Gould's work.   Looking backward, for example, one may speak of an evolutionary path, even if there was no path in prospect.   Gould is not satisfied to make sure his readers understand the distinction, no, he sees a wicked failing that he and only he can save us from.  He carries on about right and wrong evolutionary graphics, without considering that what is appropriate depends upon what one wants to show.  Wouldn't a chart exhaustively illustrating evolution have to be painted on the side of a block-long skyscraper?  Isn't describing the Burgess fauna as separate phyla kind of like calling someone a great-grandparent at birth?  In this society, fourth cousins would be considered to be only distantly related, but their great-great-grandparents were siblings.   I find it hard to believe that these specimans are actually more diverse than, say, a whale, a mosquito, blue-green algae, a salmon and a vulture.  Gould keeps saying that they are, but he doesn't produce much evidence.  I recommend that the reader see Derek E. G. Briggs' book The Fossils of the Burgess Shale and Simon Conway Morris' Crucible of Creation (also on the Burgess Shale) as well as his Life's Solution.  In the latter, Conway Morris disagrees sharply with the conclusions that Gould reaches in his last chapter "Possible Worlds" 
 Ballroom and Latin dance has come a long way.  Even though many of the dancers on the DVD are still at the top ranks of the pro circuit, this is NOT a great showcase. This is nice to watch in order to compare to the styles and skill of today, but not the kind of video you will watch over and over.  The only truly spectacular dancing is that of Marcus and Karen Hilton (standard only).  They were then, and are now quite amazing.  For those of us in Canada, Alain Doucet and Anik Jolicouer are on this tape, briefly, in the Standard final 
  Five-Element Constitutional Acupuncture, as the authors clearly state in their introduction, is a synthesis of several influences including five element acupuncture and TCM. This well organized book thoughtfully presents their work.  Professor J.R. Worsley, with whom they studied early in their careers, was widely recognized as a living master of Classical Five-Element Acupuncture.  Although the authors accurately present portions of what Professor Worsley taught, these are intermingled with such fundamental departures that Five Element Constitutional Acupuncture cannot be considered a clear transmission of the lineage  he learned, practiced, and taught.  Rather than attempting to improve upon the system, Professor Worsley gained his level of mastery by practicing and teaching it exactly as he was taught by his own masters and theirs before them. Doing so requires developing one's awareness and senses to an extraordinary level. Patterns of behavior, body types, facial expressions, constitutional and mental characteristics presented by the authors as corresponding to each element are generalizations which exist only in one's mind. They have no application whatsoever to practicing Classical Five-Element Acupuncture with actual patients.   In short, Five Element Constitutional Acupuncture presents the authors own theories and synthesis of five element acupuncture with TCM principles. Professor J.R. Worsley's own books presently serve as the clearest, most accurate guide for those interested in following in this late Master's footsteps.

 This book is a very basic guide for someone who has never taken a psychology class before, giving information on library searches and how to use the internet.  The two chapters on statistics were informative, though drawn out.  It's a very dry read 
 I'm glad I found this book in the library and didn't buy it! After hearing the good reviews here I was shocked at how poor this book really was. I'm a fan of the paranormal and have studied it for a long time, I am always looking for new views and info whether it be pro or con. But this book is obviously a debunking manuscript. And a poor one at that! It tackles only the weakest of cases, ignores REAL evidence, and brings forth "rational" explanations that are even more far out than the paranormal explanation. The section on crop circles was horrible, dismissing it as a hoax without even LOOKING AT ANY of the fascinating evidence that this is a real occurance. Pass 
 I find the mostly 5 star reviews of Adam Bede rather puzzling. I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.   Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.  What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego.  Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works.  
 This is one of those books where if you believe the main thesis you will come away nodding your head in approval at the well thought out cogent arguments put forward. On the other hand someone with the slightest misgivings about the content will more than likely throw the book away in disgust before getting half way.  Falling into the latter camp I just wish that a Creationist could put forward his or her argument without once mentioning Evolution. I do not need to reinforce my belief in Evolution by attacking the bible. 
 I placed an online order of the set at RONCO and cancelled it 5 minutes later.  To confirm my concellation is in time, I called RONCO hours later.  Despite their promise on the phone, they still send the package.  After I refuses to accept the shipment (follow their instruction), they still charge me $35 for the shipping.  These people do business in such disgraceful way.  How can you expect a good quality product from them 
 As biographies of interesting people go, especially for a guy as colorful and gutsy as Bernard Kerrick, this book is disappointingly BORING.  The book is poorly written, with an over-emphasis on Kerrick's childhood and alcoholic/prostitute mother who was murdered after he was taken from her custody. The book becomes mildly engaging in the chapters where Kerrick takes over running Rykers Island and subsequently the NYPD, but the book waits far too long before bringing us up to modern events.  Another strong criticism is Kerrick's persistance in constantly singling out NYPD officers by name and carrying on about how great they are, what heroes, their sacrifices etc. Yes, fine, we get it. They are heroes. But this book is about YOUR life. Its as if he promised like 200 drinking buddies to include their names in his book and didn't want to reneg. Also, the butt kissing to Guliani teeters a bit on the excessive. Yes, Guliani is a grat man and kissing his butt is OK-just do it on your own time Bernie.

 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 This product works well when I use it with a curling iron.  The low rating is for the cost.  I just don't think it is worth over $20 
 I'm a fundamentalist Christian who loathes this book. I'm about as theologically conservative a person as you're ever likely to find. So why do I hate this book so much?  Well, for one thing, it encourages people to chase after things after God says no. This woman waited for five years for a man who said that she was kind of attractive (to her face!) even after her family and HIS family told her to let it go. God opens the doors he wants opened. She kept pounding away until she got HER will done.  The most important thing, however, is that this book is intensely religious. Religion is antithetical to the spirit of Christ. It is, in fact, demonic.   So why does Elisabeth encourage us to follow her example exactly? Why does she intimate that it's wrong for a person to touch his beloved's cheek? Is God not dynamic? Are His mercies not new every morning? Does he want us to act exactly like someone else? Does he want us to be deprived of the glorious liberty that exists within obedience? I'm just sayin'. 
 If a book thoroughly angers and frustrates you, does that mean it's a good book or a bad book?  In the case of MERCY, I'll have to go with the latter.  I found I could not get past my intense dislike of both Cam and Mia, truly two of the most despicable, selfish characters I've ever read in any book.  I've read murder mysteries with killers who had more admirable qualities.  Their sole intent were their own wants and needs, regardless of who (Cam's wife Allie) got hurt.  Allie was described early on in the book as someone who people walk all over.  I never got that impression.  She was the owner of her own business, and she was determined to help Cam's cousin Jamie.  She also happened to be a woman deeply in love with her husband.  It was her love and loyalty that Cam felt totally comfortable in betraying.  At one point late in the book, Allie asks Cam if he and Mia had laughed at her.  He tells her no.  However in a way, they did, considering they had no problem having sex in her flower shop and her bed.  I felt for Allie.  She deserved far better then Cam  I really wanted this book to be more about mercy killing and euthanasia.  Instead it was more about infidelity and how far a person is willing to go for someone they love.  Infidelity seems to be a pretty constant story line in most of Picoult's books (I understand her latest book, THE TENTH CIRCLE is no different.)  She is without a doubt an excellent writer, but this one just wasn't for me 
 Very dissapointed in the quality of this VHS tape.This third installment does not measure up to the first two. Production values very poor.It looks as if the copy I received was made from a copy, picture was not clear and sound was terrible. I am sending this tape back 
 Since all other reviews are very positive, I'm here to offer a different opinion.  I've had this book for over a year now, and I barely use it. Each time I attempt to find something useful in it, the information is scattered over the entire book making it extremely difficult to understand.  For example, right now I'm looking up the "ref" attribute, and according to the index, it appears on 7 different locations throughout the book, each portion shorter than 1 page. Also, I have seen many tables scattered throughout with exact same information, or one or two differing field values, making it very confusing to understand which table is doing what.  And at over 500 pages long, there is a large amount of filler information in this book.  Is this book "definitive"? It looks like it is. Is this book usable? Absolutely not. This is one of the worst investments I've made in computer books.  And there is a place about strings in the book where it differs from the official W3C specs 
 Journalism requires objectivity first and foremost, but this book offers little. It makes no reasonable effort to provide points of view outside those of the perpetrators presented here.   The book profiles such figures as Pyongyang-born Kim Hyon Hui, who on Nov. 28, 1987 destroyed Korean Air Flight 858, loaded with passengers bound for Seoul; Leila Khaled, a Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacker with "great hatred of the Jews;" and Red Brigade kidnapper Susan Ronconni, whose group murdered former Italian premier Aldo Moro.   The book parrots their words, and romances their actions as well as the indoctrination of children to hatred and war. MacDonald observes children taught to throw stones at the age of two as adorable resisters, not the examples of parental and societal abuse that they are. She presents unconfirmed reports of Israeli "abuse" without skepticism and pronounces these women "extraordinary," rendering both the reports and the book suspect.   This 1991 book provides an early view of all that is wrong with the Western press corps. Now, reporters go even further, and use every euphemism in the dictionary for people who purposely target civilians. They are terrorists, not "militants" or "activists."   Presenting female killers as normal or even worthy blurs the lines between acceptable and unacceptable. I see nothing normal about their sentiments and nothing glamorous about their desire to inflict pain and suffering on innocents, be they Korean, German--or Israeli.   The author presents the transparent anti-Semitism of those insisting they "do not hate Jews, only Israelis" without comment. Carried to its logical conclusion, this view denies the Jewish people alone among peoples and nations the right to self-determination.  Sorry, but this book flunks journalism 101.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 My Dell Laptop D600 running Windows XP, didn't recognize the device when I plugged it into either USB port.  I contacted Targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that I should try it on another PC.  If it doesn't work on this laptop, I have no use for it.  There is no CD ROM for support drivers and Targus support stated that I shouldn't need any drivers.  Went to Microsoft website for compatibility and the device wasn't listed.  I should have researched this before the purchase.  I would not recommend anyone purchasing it. 
 I read this book after watching the brilliant movie version of "The Hours."  If that's your motivation, don't waste your time.  My English teachers will cringe when I say it, but this book, well, sucks. It may well be great literature, but the characters are not engaging, and if it was Woolf's motive to out-do James Joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative, she doesn't pull it off.  Again, the characters and the internal mental life simply don't have the power that "Ulysses" has.  Reading Woolf is necessary for a good eduction.  I recommend, however, that you read "To the Lighthouse". I may still be motivated to read the book version of "The Hours" given how great the movie was.  But my taste for Woolf is all done now.   
 I don't know, but.. I couldn't get myself to swallow it. It made me, literally, vomit. I wish I just ordered Power Bar's Vanilla-Yoghurt flavored one, which tastes fantastic and I love so very much.  Anyway, probably it's just me but, it really really makes me sick.. I thought I would taste something new but oh well.. 
 This is the perfect book if you bought your tivo brand new over two years ago and have not upgraded to series 2.  Alot of the Hacks are Hints and Tricks you already know if you are an experienced Tivo user of at least one day.  It is pretty much useless for Series 2 Tivo's. I will be returning mine and buy the von hagen book. Shame on you O'reilly, usually you put out really good books 
 I picked this up instead of the Let's Go guide because the latter got terrible reviews on amazon. Big mistake. The bulk of this guide is a sort of hyper-planned series of walks through varous districts. I don't know about you, but my idea of fun is not having someone tell me "now turn right, and look upwards."   The guide also has a big habit of repeating information that is presumably on the walls of museums that it guides you through. What on Earth? The Louvre walk is fine, but Steves on the Centre Pompidou (the main 20th century art collection) can only be described as juvenile.  What I look for in a guide is for someone to give me the layout and must-see parts of a few of the central districts. Paris is not some dark corner of the world that nobody's heard of -- so why do we get pages and pages on the history of Paris as described in a museum? There's so much extra weight here that the book could be literally slimed to 1/3rd the size.  Finally, the section on nightlife -- i.e., good bars, what's up with the music scene, etc. etc. -- is literally HALF a page. I am not joking. You will know nothing about what to see and what to avoid if your idea of fun doesn't stop when the Louvre closes. (Steves' other nightlife suggestions are to repeat walks from the day -- and he has the surreal suggestion that you try to "tour" Paris by taking a Taxi! That's right, everyone pile into a cab, hand the driver a (translated) series of directions, and off you go -- sounds miserable.)  In the end, it seems this guide is useful only for families and more sedate folks who plan to religiously follow the walks and go to bed at eight. Even if that's you, beware: the information in the guide is organized in such a way that makes it hard if you want to deviate from "the Rick Steves way." This is NOT a guide for those wishing to experience Paris in a spontaneous fashion.  Two stars because the "sleeping" section is actually very good at giving helpful advice on finding a hotel in the right neighborhood 
 THIS DEVISE WAS DEFECTIVE. IT GOT VERY HOT WHEN PLUGGED IN TO LIGHTER. I was lucky to discover this problem before there was a fire. I threw it away!! I just can not take a chance on a product that fails in this manner.  A three dollar item just about took out my fifty thousand dollar navigator!!  I went to fry's! Becare with these low cost devices that may stay plugged in while you are not in your vehicle ...do risk a fire 
 I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.  On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.  Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?  The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points.   For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.   
 nice and handy, but i don't like the spiral format. pages are flimsy and begin to rip and shear off shortly  after purchase even with careful moderate use. just a waste of money. the only difference between the quick and the desk is the inclusion of the coding chart with the desk reference. 
 As some of the reviews below suggest (albeit approvingly), this is a one-sided rehash of the modern cliches about this era:  the Christians retaking their land are evil and intolerant; the Muslims who violently seized these lands in the first place are noble and benificent.  I look forward to reading Mr. Reston's forthcoming book on the bloody Muslim conquests of the Middle East, northern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Turkey and the Balkans, and their forcible conversion of millions throughout those lands, which were once predominantly Christian.  That should be a ripping good read.  I give it two stars because at least the prose is lively 
 A pitiful extended bore...how many times do you have to see the intrepid pilots fly up the fjord practice run to get the picture.  This one ought to be coupled with "The revenge of the Killer Tomatoes"....save your dough from this turkey 
 I've not read other attempts at Billy Joel biographies, so this one definitely contained some interesting facts that I, as a long fan, did not know.  It was incredibly difficult, however, to pull those tidbits out from the terrible and often ridiculous prose that is the writing (and editing -- hello typos -- "through" and "thorough" are not the same word!) of this book.  The author tries (too hard) to draw parallels where none exist solely for the sake of attempted literary-ness.  Commenting on the "McCarthyism" of "Good Night Saigon" (so that he could refer to another song on The Nylon Curtain as having traces of "McCartneyism"  -- get it?)?  That song is anything but.  I especially loved when the author recounted a diatribe Billy made against music industry forces that try to stifle an artist's creativity.  Billy apparently said something along the lines of once an artist lets the people who control the money influence the art, then the art begins to stink like a dead horse.  The author makes the feeble attempt to say this remark is a passing reference to when Billy's former manager and brother-in-law, Frank Weber, stole money from Billy by, among other things, getting involved in intentionally maiming horses for insurance money.  Are you joking?  People with money trying to control the artist's decision + dead horse.  Um -- clearly the author has never seen The Godfather.  Sure, Mr. Bordowitz, that's ALL about an insurance fraud/race horse scam.  Good one.  Overall, the writing was terrible and VERY repetitive.  He frequently used the exact same quote two or three times, sometimes within a span of just a few pages.  As I said, where is the editor?  I would recommend this book if you want to learn some more details about Billy Joel, but be warned.  As a book, it sucks.  Big time.  (Ultimate irony:  Read the last chapter wherein the author recounts how, at one time, Billy had agreed to cooperate with a biography but only if was a respectable author who actually could write.  And then the author wonders why it would be that Billy refused to particpate in the writing of this rag.  Hmmm.  Check the mirror, bub.  The writing stinks.  Kinda like a dead horse. 
 I couldn't wait to see this movie.  Knowing that it was a creation of Rob Zombie's I had the highest of hopes for it.  It fell very short of those hopes.  It started off decent and definitely creepy, then went so far off the path it wasn't funny.  We go from serial killers to cyborgs?  What was Rob Zombie thinking?  I love horror films, but this one was a HUGE waste of my time 
 I can't write a review because I had to send both CD's back because they would not play.  I just ordered another one yesterday, and here's hoping that will be okay 
 Ross Thomas isn't exactly one of my favourite authors, but I liked some of his other books, so I didn't miss the occasion to read his Edgar-winning novel (his second, because he had won twenty years ago for "The Cold War Swap") and I have been very disappointed. It's as well written than usual, with brilliant metaphors and dialogue, but the plot seemed to me some confused. The characters speak almost only by epigraphs, and one never know what the story is about. I don't have in mind the other Edgar nominees for this year, but I'm sure there was many novels more deserving than this 
 I agree with the many other users who have experienced the "Condensation, Operation Paused" defect on their JVC GR-xxxx. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs. 
 What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association.  It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like "is the kennel business for me?" and "what are the main issues in kennel management?"  Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US.  For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 This book did not give the info promised. It does not rate each product. Only gives a review of what something is. I was very disappointed with this book & do not recommend. Go get Baby bargains. It's been my bible! 
 The product is great, I already have the uni-lateral one and it rocks, so i wanted to buy the BI- Lateral aka 2.. and two times they have sent me UNI ones that were labeled as BI.. So your  best bet is to bi 2 uni's by themselves until amazon fixes the problem.. 
 Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.  This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.  Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:  1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell 2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell  Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals 
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 I have been reading Danielle Steel for a long time, and it seems to me lately I can guess the plot and the ending long before I get there.  Her books are starting to copy themselves, same thing different setting.  I really had a hard time getting through this one because she kept repeating herself when talking about Sasha's feelings, the book could've been a lot shorter if she didn't write the same thing over and over.  I would not recommend this one 
 I thought this was an awful book.  The author cobbled together press clippings and an infatuation.  I bet Fred Couples was sorry he ever talked to her 
 Simon Winchester's journey up the Yangtze river is often poetic and overruns with historical detail every eddie of the way up the river. If anything, this is an incredible historical text of China. The author's research is impeccable and undeniable. However, every word of the way through this book I couldn't help but feel a profound disappointment in what could have been, but clearly is not, one of the the most epic journeys of our time. Mr. Winchester's timing was perfect, a trip up the Yangtze before the Three Gorges dam would change it forever and as the country is experiencing a rebirth that will soon make it the largest economic superpower in the world where it is destined to stay for the next century.  Yet with all his research, all the planning, and all the help he received along the way, we're left with only a few hundred pages of text. Where are the thousands of pictures? Where are the video clips of his journey? Where is the interactive website? He mentions in the opening pages that he packed a Leica M6 camera but, at least in the paperback edition, there is not a single picture in the book. From a man who successfully sued the Defense Department over the Freedom of Information Action in order to get the Pentagon's most detailed maps of the river, I expected more. Instead, we are left with a very long-winded account of the author's journey, but not a deserving account of China's journey 
 I think one of the other reviewers said it best: this book is for unapologetic elitists.  It completely turned me off from the first chapter.  
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 Although The flatware is nice looking... I bought these because they claimed it was 18/10 stainless steel, what I received was 18/0. Be aware 
 There is very little actual information in the book.  My 4 year old wants to know WHY, HOW, WHEN, WHERE for everything... this book is very short and has very simple drawings.  Did not meet our needs 
 This cookbook received rave reviews and is from a world reknown hospital.  Sounded great but what a disappointment!  A handfull of recipes, nothing new or exciting or even inspiring. I felt I wasted my time and money on this one and returned it.  I would have given it 0 stars if that was an option 
  Nothing hear, just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man. Whoa, if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions, I would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene. 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 I expropriated this book from the Princeton History Department, where it was forlornly residing underneath a "Free To Anyone" sign. I got what I paid for. It's crap, and babble, and everything else that uniformly applies to anything written by a deconstructionist, structuralist, or similar academic mountebank. If you come across a copy, skim it for laughs. (Trust me: you won't have to get past the Introduction to find some uproariously awful sentences. 
 Buddhist math? C'mon.  First, let me say that fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are great tools. They're valued parts of the 'soft logic' kit that includes probability, interval arithmetic, Bayesian and Markov networks, and lots of other good stuff. Fuzziness involves many of the formal techniques used in probability and elsewhere, and gives a useful, alternative view of the systems it addresses.  The basic fuzzy idea is that most descriptions involve shades of gray, that few systems really match the black/white, on/off, either/or duality of standard formal logic. That's fine, I can get along with that quite well.   My problem, though, is that Kosko presents the fuzzy world-view vs. the traditional or "scientific" in exactly the black and white terms that he rejects. He also argues that fuzziness describes the world more effectively than "scientific" terms, that the rules of arithmetic, probability, and calculus are just games. They are played for their internal consistency, not because differentiation or factorials occur in nature.  That's true, and as a heavy math user I know enough to distinguish my models from reality. Two facts remain, though. First, the models very often do describe reality in ways that can be checked easily enough: the bridge doesn't fall down and the TV receives its signal. Both happen because the bad old exact arithmetic has some kind of correspondence (no, I don't know what) to the real world, giving real ability to predict real results. Second, fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are themselves mathematical formalisms, games like all the others. Once you get past the gee-whiz stage, there is mathematical content as rigorous as in any other field of study. It's not either/or, it's very often a different way to interpret the same self-consistent games people have played for years. It adds interesting rules to the game.  The great thing is that you really can use the new interpretations and tools along with the old ones. Fuzziness doesn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.   And you can get all these benefits without shrink-wrapped, bite-sized pieces of Eastern philosophy.  //wiredweir 
 The dialogue in the last three books in the center is not engaging. This was difficult to finish. It seems every scene centered around, "I'm sorry. 
 I saw the Bill Moyer's PBS series on Huston Smith.  I was very impressed.  I bought The World's Religions by Huston Smith and was blown away.  Fantastic summaries of the 7 great world religions and a chapter on the lesser religions.  I've had the question nagging at the back of my mind for a while, "Does religion really matter?"  So, when coming across Why Religion Matters I knew I had to read it.  I didn't read the whole book.  I fell just short of 200 pages before giving up.  The book wasn't getting to the point.  It just kept bashing science and Scientism, over and over.  This is a dreadful book 
 When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey. 
 I previously purchased a SIIG Firewire 800 Expresscard. After several weeks with SIIG tech support I'm told it is a known issue that card won't work with Dell laptops. So ... i phoned Belkin TechSupport before buying this card. They tell me they know of no such problems. Well, card gives exact same problem as SIIG! Works fine on Firewire 400 but the minute you use 1394b (Firewire 800) drivers, my Dell Inspiron 9400 bluescreens and reboots! Emailed and phoned Belkin tech support but no response/solution. From my experience, Dell Inspiron 9400/E1705's can't support Firewire 800.  Update: after almost 2 months of trying to get a resolution from Belkin, they advise their product development team is "still working on the problem". Would I recommend buying a Belkin product, no way, that level of customer service is a disgrace 
 In it's 64 pages it gives no extra information if you have an experience of a few months on keeping fish 
 I love QMS. I am lukewarm about Dino Valenti. But everything else about them is great. This recording is obviously taken from a radio broadcast. The music may have been good but the sound quality is very ordinary. Greatdul Dead have shown that old tapes can be cleaned up to provide listenable recordings. No one bothered with this one. Unfortunately 
 I have an eclectic taste in my reading material and I was hoping this book would present a neat atmospheric tableau upon which the author spun her "facts" about this topic, but I didn't find much that was impressive, cool, informative, or even suitably moody about Solitary Witch. In short, I'm sorry to say it was a bit of a letdown. EXCEPT man that cover is wild! Might I make the suggestion that better packaging would help a future edition? By that I mean dress up the interior with art and design that matches the grand cover. That would really spark this tome up 
 I opened this book without having read a single review, armed solely with the knowledge that it had won the National Book Award.  I wish I had been armed with a paper shredder.  For such a rich and potentially captivating topic, Tuck did a horrendous job.  The life of the beautiful Ella Lynch, mistress South America's most enigmatic and charismatic tyrant, should have provided us with cutural and personal insights beyond a standard history text book.  For example, I would have liked to have finished this book with an understanding of how Francisco Solano Lopez managed to inspire 60% to 80% (depending on your source) of his country's inhabitants to die in a war which had absolutely no rationale.  Instead, I got a good solid dose of the Latin Lover.  Tuck did her research, but not to a greater degree than any high school student.  At no point in the story did I gain an understanding of the causes of the war, or of the unique political and social position held by Paraguay in South America at that time.  Not only did Tuck miss the broader context--the political rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, the constant power vacillations of post-independence South America, the struggle to establish national identities--she completely failed to establish the character of Paraguay and Paraguayans.  This is as unforgivable in a historical novel as failing to develop the characters (a feat which Tuck also manages to accomplish!).  Not only did Tuck do a slap dab job with South American history, her writing was consistently poor.  Long botanical lists which had no relevance to the plot (what little there was), letters, diary entries, which were all meant to provide the reader with verisimilitude, merely slowed down the prose.  Short,almost cartoonish, sexual encounters between undeveloped characters, one-paragraph vignettes, strange graphic violence, all gave a disjointed quality to the prose which made it tempting to skip paragraphs, if not whole pages.  Last, but not least, the author clearly does not speak Spanish.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she employed the services of a native speaker to check her error-ridden manuscript. (And where, pray tell, was her editor?)It was highly irritating to wade through grammar mistakes that a first-year Spanish student could have caught and corrected.  All in all, a highly disappointing read 
 I had high hopes for this book.  They were dashed.  It's mostly a series of "tests" to determine what to do and "letters" about surreally unbelievable situations.  For this book, "white trash" implies that burglary is the preferred career, everybody has four or more husbands/wives over time and innumerable dalliances beyond, and any carnal urge results in children who must be taught how to burgle.  It's just not funny, and has nothing in common with Jeff Foxworthy or David Barry writing about similar topics. 
 Funny that a book about execution doesn't get it accomplish. The authors have a lot of experience and I am sure are good at leading and executing. However, the book does not get to the point. The authors ramble about their managing experience and almost 300 pages to transmit few ideas 
 The historical portion of the book is interesting but the notes on staging a review are horrbily trite and seriously out of date. They were probably relavent 20 years ago 
 Bennett makes few if any good points in this book about the problems our culture faces.  Most of the book is spent showing how many people were "critics" and how he showed them who was boss.  Bennett criticizes anyone who wishes to include diversity in the American life: through "controversial" art which he deems a "bad joke" simply because it may shock viewers, through a desire for schooling that does not impose Christian ideals upon its students by force, through courses that don't only include dead white men of the western world, etc.  Bennett's argument is that his racist, homophobic, beauraucratic, Christian-supremicist version of morality is the only feasible one and must be imposed upon all children in any institution of education.  He spends most of the book laughing off his critics and indignantly ignoring any of their points, casting them off as just being jealous that their plans aren't as good as his.  Yet he thinks vouchers will help poor students, that an abolishment of affirmative action will help minorities, and that "beheading" drug dealers is morally plausible.  The section on drugs has a little bit of insight, but the books few good points are obscured by his blatant arrogance and conservative ideals 
 Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama. 
 I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it 
 This book is absolutely not worth reading--it's barely readable, has no defined plot, and is an overall disappointment. There is no plot in this book beyond sex scenes and clumsily drawn out character "relationships" which tend to consist of the protagonist realizing that she has to have sex with someone.  I don't recommend this book at all 
 Gloom and doom with a left wing slant.  Peak oil is real but this guy is extrapolating many trends to arrive at his version of a gloomy future.  The sky is falling, the sky is falling 
 Nadia Choucha's book "Surrealism and the Occult" is a failure on every level, partly because she fails to do more than skim the surface of the surrealists interest in the occult and even that inadequately. She fails to even mention Victor Brauner, obviously hasn't the faintest idea of the connections between surrealists such as Jorge Camacho and Martin Stejskal and alchemy, nor the importance of figures such as Malcolm de Chazal, the great philosopher of analogy. She substitutes a clumsy and fictitious tie-in with Kenneth Grant and Austin Spare and although a comparison between Spare's automatism with the surrealist concept might have been interesting, she largely botches this because she simply has not done her research properly.  I am told that Choucha originally wrote this as an undergraduate dissertation. It should have stayed that way. It could have been the starting point for a much better book if only she had bothered to find out enough to write the book that it should have been. A silly book, written out of ignorance. What a shame. And what  a shame that there is no other book that covers the whole of this underesearched area that could replace Choucha's. There is a great opening here for any real scholar, or better still, surrealist, who cares to make the effort.  
 I bought this book because the authors are very interesting and unusual people.  Ray Kurzweil is one of few genuine geniuses of modern technology, and Dr. Grossman seems a very engaged and knowledgeable physician with a prevention-based practise, which I applaud.  It quickly became evident that Ray Kurzweil has a major impetus towards this topic of life extension because of a family history of disease and early death- but, hey, he's not that different from any of us.  I myself am a boomer who would really like to find some ways to live as long and healthily as possible, and I'm sure the audience of similar boomers is quite substantial.  That is why there are quite a few books similar to this one appearing.  I have read several of these books, am in the medical field, and am quite familiar with the literature on health and life extension.  The basic problem with this and many other books is that a program is offered after some discussion of the topic (often very selective) but the program is NOT supported by anything like sufficient evidence to merit its adoption.     I could enlarge on this about a lot of areas of this book, but just to give one example is the issue of supplements.  Ray takes about 260 pills a day, and Dr. Grossman about 60 (apparently they don't quite agree).   It is very hard to know if these supplements are going to help you, and, importantly that they won't harm you.  Just to give an example, even the supplements which would have appear most promising, antioxidant vitamins C and E, have been studied in appropriate trials, and have given very mixed results.   In one study, antioxidants of various types were  tested  to see if they would reduce lung cancer incidence.  One antioxidant was associated with a HIGHER incidence of lung cancer.  Supplement with care.  In the end, what can you do?  Well, you can be sure you never smoke, do not allow yourself to become obese, eat a nutritious balanced diet, get regular aerobic exercise, and keep engaged and purposeful as possible in all aspects of your life.  You can't write a book and just have this one sentence, but it appears to be the truth at the present time.  The future- nanotechnology molecular machines zipping around our bodies finding and zapping tumors and so on may happen- but don't hold your breath.  This is interesting speculation, but you may not see it until 100 (or 1000) years from now, if ever 
 As a long time fan of the 80's Metallica, this was a horrible disappointment to me after waiting so long for some new material from the guys.  Not only has all the thrash been stripped away, but the rock has shades of alternative music throughout.    Although "Ain't My Bitch" starts out more or less on the right track, the album soon becomes boring, because while the soloing, time changes, and little interludes have mostly disappeared from the songs, they are still mighty long.  Metallica originally wrote long songs so as to properly let them breathe, but these alterna-metal snore-fests would be better if they were short.    For what it's worth, the public seemed to love this and there was suddenly a new generation of Metallica fans, yet again.  It seems that Metallica knew exactly what they were doing by taking time off and then coming out with a different sound that kept them in the mainstream.  That doesn't make me enjoy "Load" any more, though 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 "This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad." - Prologue.  Well, that certainly could have been the story.  But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in "the history of the horse") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so.  Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book.  So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered.  Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go. 
 If you get an edition, such as "Signet Classic", that includes The Spooniad and the Epilogue, then you will have three bad works of poetry to wade through, the last two blessedly short.  The idea is a good one; a series of monologues from dead former townspeople, touching the major incidents of their lives, many of them connected, sometimes in surprising ways.  But Masters is just not a good enough poet.  He attempts blank verse monologues in the style of Robert Frost (as in North of Boston) but succeeds only in demonstrating how difficult a form it is and how it takes the brilliance of someone like Frost to pull it off.  I can see that a few of them are worthwhile and would themselves make good anthology pieces, but mostly they are simply second rate prose poems of no significance.  In my review of Winesburg, Ohio I compared Sherwood Anderson unfavorably with Masters, saying that he lacked Masters' humanity.  But - like most people, I suspect - I had only read selections from Spoon River.  Now that I have paddled the length of it, I can tell you it is meandering, flows very slowly, and contains very little life. 
 I received this sheet and was immediately disappointed.  The quality is very cheap and it wasn't a perfect fit.  I am surprised that this is made by Graco - usually their products are good.  I would not recommend buying this. I would buy a regular crib sheet instead. 
 This book is like the 'Da Vinci Code' for SharePoint.  It has a lot of information.  A LOT OF INFORMATION.  The problem is, the layout and order of presentation in the book make it almost impossible to read and find information.  Loading the included disk is a requirement.  Use the PDF and search electronically for the information because the printed index is incredibly lacking.  Because it is so hard to find stuff, one thinks that MS is trying to hide information or that critical information was left out.  Good resource, but be prepared for a continent spanning search for information that will takes days, leave you bedraggled, and make you think you've solved centuries old mysteries once you finally find what you are looking for.  Pack lightly, carry currency, and perhaps a firearm (for the book, share point machine, self, your choice) 
 Method: Take a monster, genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago, borrow the voicings, polyrhythms and sound effects, rearrange them to slightly (but not *that*) different tunes, crib the album art (cheesy then; cheesier now) and re-release.  The point? Well, to The Man, it's obvious. There's one born every minute. But for genuine, discerning afficionados of electronica? Search me. Like a good souffle, it was better the first time.  Indeed, inventing Oxygene Parts 7 - 13 is almost as pointless an exercise as going back and re-recording the original album from scratch. And guess what turned out to be Jarre's next project?   Whoops! Writer's block, perchance?  Olly Buxto 
 Look at the prices on a seasons sci-fi set now a days.  Paramount has to be crazy to keep the price this high for a show that was great in its time but there are better now. If you buy it for this price, I can give you number for a phychologist. You can afford to have your mind examined 
 I have studied in the area that these authors write for over 30 years and find their work to be rehashed theses that have been discredited over the years by sound scholarship; they are more likely to be believed by conspiracy theorists and Dan Brown devotees than classical or bibical scholars. The massive endnotes look impressive on the surface but reflect considerable secondary source reliance rather than interaction with primary documents. The authors appear to be novices of the subject about which they write. Confusion on textual and historical relationships of various sources; failure to recognize the considerable variance in the development of mystery religions as to their influence on early Christianity; the fact that borrowing often went the other way due to the triumph of Christianity in the empire and that Greek religion borrowed Christian themes; the failure to see the important contribution of Judaism, apart from Graeco-Roman paganism, on the origin and growth of early Christianity, among other matters, lie at the bottom of the book's tenuous thesis. Many of the book's examples of Greek religion (unlike Greek philosophy that was used by early Christian apologists) and its impact on Christian thought are just historically inaccurate.  The reader is overwhelmed with the considerable data page after page, often irrevelant data since historical periods and Greek religions are often haphazardly mixed together, but unless the reader is versed in Hellenistic religions and in Christian origins he or she is likely to be led down a false trail 
 Despite what the tag line promises, this is not an epic story of WW II's most dramatic mission.  It is ridicuous to even suggest such a thing.  At best this is a superficial recounting of a late war mission which turned out not to be not nearly as dangerous as it could have been.  The bravery of the men who took part in the raid cannot be questioned.  However, there are countless other tales of WW II that recount much more horrificly dangerous events than the one depicted here.  The book simply fails to deliver.  If you are looking for a gripping tale of the horror and heroism that defined WW II this is not the one 
 This book has a great title, but somewhat lackluster content. The book is really not so much about changing the world, and more about one organization in particular. In addition to focusing on an organization, I find that the stories of the people *in* the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they've found who have made or are making a difference in the world.  It's not necessarily bad-there are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you. It just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often 
 I have been studying Abraham Lincoln for nearly 40 years.  Burlingame is inaccurate in many of his statements about Lincoln and Mary Lincoln in particular and does not present all of the information about both of them.  Possibly his most faulty act is using William Herndon's information about Lincoln and Mary Lincoln.  Herndon and Mary Lincoln hated each other.  After Lincoln passed away, Herndon may have very well said things about Lincoln and her to hurt, degrade and disgrace Mary Lincoln.  Herndon is NOT to be trusted to be accurate much of the time.  Other very poor Lincoln authors are Weik, Sandburg, Gore Vidal, Lerone Bennett, Jr., Thomas DiLorenzo, Vincent Harding and Barbara Fields.  Their accuracy, interpretations and images are usually wrong and at times even bizarre.  If you want to read professionally researched, much more accurate material about Lincoln, read books by David Herbert Donald, Stephen Oates, Frank Williams, Mark Neely, Jr., Edward Steers, Jr. and Allen Guelzo 
 I feel like the Grinch of all time for saying this, but Linda Richman is really not that funny. Mike Meyers based The Coffee Tawk Lady on her, but it's Mike Meyers that's funny, not his muse. So if you're looking for someone who can make you laugh out loud through your tears, I suggest you look elsewhere. That said, her advice was sound. Her heart is good, her tips are wise and accessible, and she seems like she has a good heart. But sorry, she's not a laugh riot. And her wisdom, while sincere and hard-earned, was not all that insightful 
 While I did NOT read very much of this specific title (XPath 2.0) I was extremely disappointed after trying to read several other of these WROX series on XML, XSLT, XPATH, etc..  I had made the mistake of buying the whole series and trying to wade through these exceptionally poorly edited books. While I'm sure that these writers know their subject...they truely do NOT have a clue as to how to write cohesive, instructional material. If you want to find much better writing on this subject, look for some zoo animals on the cover instead of photos of the authors. I really felt cheated having bought the whole series of these WROX books. This is the first time that I have felt this enraged about poor writing.. 
 Our family loves the first three "Home Alone" movies. But this fourth in the series is a dud. They keep the same character names as the first two movies, but they are totally different actors playing the parts. They should have just made up new characters.  Secondly, in this movie there is very little of the slapstick humor which made the first three so funny. In the first three, the boy set elaborate traps which the bad guys fell for. In this fourth movie, there are few traps set, and they are not original or that funny.  One other disappointing aspect of this fourth movie - in this movie the family is being broken apart by divorce. Although the divorce is not final yet, the husband has already moved in with his girlfriend and is getting engaged. Not the best for family values!  Overall, we were very disappointed with this movie, which provided few laughs. Stick with the first three if you want a movie to keep you laughing 
     I ordered this DVD to show at school to my eighth-grade class after we read the novel; however, the language was unacceptable for the classroom.  The book did not have the four-letter word nor the Lord's name in vain.  Due to the foul language, I did not show the DVD. Maybe a note that the DVD is not recommended for classroom use would be helpful. In addition, it did not follow the plot in the book.  My students were looking forward to viewing the movie and were disappointed that they were unable to do so 
 I simply do not see any point in mixing Crime Fiction with Crime and Punishment.   
 I found this book through Taunton Press who reputably published books and magazines on the finer skills of sewing.  I am very glad that I borrowed Sew Subversive from my local library before purchasing it!  As the other reviews state, the main topics cover re-vamping your thrift store find.  On the brighter side, the first third of the book covers the basic sewing skills such as tension for a sewing machine and a couple of hand stithes.  Overall, I would recomend this book as a gift for an adolescent teen who would like to learn a bit about sewing 
 I love tornado movies, but this one such a disappointment. Come on, walking around in the "eye" of tornado? It's obvious the makers of this absurdly stupid movie knew nothing about tornados, or simply chose to ignore reality. The special effects are terrible. The CGI(?) tornadoes more resemble dark dust bunnies than tornadoes. The spinning stocking (or whatever it was) in the old "Wizzard Of Oz" looks better.  
 An 18th century author writing about the dark ages. It reads more like incidents within a narrative rather than a single story.  I found the ending abrupt and not credible. I expected more of the creator of Sherlock Holmes 
 Gets a star for pointing out that writing is scary, but has nothing to offer in terms of advice beyond "do it anyway, risk-taking is good."  So now we need a writer oriented book on risk-taking, I guess 
 Understandably this is an action thriller only type of book and should not be expected to live to the works of Coyle or Clancy,  but there is little to zero development of any of the characters.  The plot is not one that anyone could take serious...how many Islamic carrier battlegroups were there???  Not to mention the relationship between the CO and XO leads towards an opinion that our Armed Forces are unprofessional. The cover alone should have said something for what I was about to read...a bad digital picture blown-up even worse from some website. Sorry people, I do not recommend this book,.  It was a disappointment even for someone who is into books for action alone 
 Did not expect much for 10 bucks... but give me a break, 2 weeks and the plastic streched and tore around the handle up on top of the smoker.  I think a heavy duty trash bag is what this product is equivalent to 
 This book is so lame... I regret every minute I spent reading it.  
 This book is remarkable in one way--it accurately represents the fantasies of many a teenage girl.  Yes, Jim really sang to YOU, even encoding special messages in his songs. ("If I WERE to say to you..." in the Ed Sullivan Show is actually a response to Ashcroft's grammar critique, who knew?) Yes, this 20-something man was entralled both intellectually and physically by a nerdy (by her own account) teenager and what he really wanted to do was trade not particularly high brow literary analogies for hours on end.  Yes, you were the only one who truly grasped the meaning of the Doors.  And this goes on for hundreds of pages.  Towards the end, I began to worry seriously about Ashcroft's mental state.   This book adequately represents the fantasy life of the pubescent, but, alas, is no more true than my high school fantasies.  And not only does it have teenager appropriate content, it also has a writing style that could have been lifted verbatim from my overwrought high school diaries.  
 A bunch of people lie to and kill each other. Everyone in the movie is either corrupt or incompetent, with the exception of a Mexican police official/crime lord and a black American DEA agent. The crime boss is a good-guy because, no matter the body count, he has a playground built for kids. The drug agent is a good-guy because, he keeps plugging along trying to get drugs off his streets. Oh, and it's a good idea not to get your girlfriend high in the hopes of having fun, because, not only will a bunch of people lie to and kill each other, your girlfriend may end up the property of a drug dealer/pimp.  It's an interesting menagerie.  It may all sound pleasant, but without humor or drama I didn't find it so. Actually, even with humor and drama, I usually don't find these crime shows pleasant. There was only one scene I found pleasant. The humor I found in this scene is probably due to the fact Drug Czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) reacted to the scene in the movie almost exactly the same way I was reacting in my seat.  This is a movie for people who feel the need to know about the illegal drug industry. I'm sure there was a HUGE audience for this movie, in that this (knowing all about drugs and feeling superior in our knowledge) is the method educators and entertainers use to keep us off them in our 'tolerant' world. Not to mention the potential audience of criminals and former players 
 This book is very easy to read and informative (I think). I was reading this book and studying its sample charts last night. Out of curiosity, I pull down some of books sample charts from online historical data. To my surprise, the real historical data charts and book's sample charts don't match. Now I wonder if I should continue study this book or not...it seems to me the sample charts are made up to support the content. I hope that's not the case. But the patterns mentioned in this book seems to work in the real world. So I'm a bit confused as why the sample charts aren't based on historical data

The Widow is a labyrinth of possible suspects and motives, making for a surprising, abrupt ending. **   Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer 
 Let's start with Outlook interface.  These are the exact words from their user manual:  "ACT! 2007 E-mail will work through Microsoft Outlook versions 2000, 2002 (XP) or 2003."  So those of us with newer versions of Outlook cannot synch the Outlook email or calendar with Act.  What's the point?  Then what are you supposed to synch with your Blackberry - Outlook so you can get your calendar and email information or Act so you can get your client database. The Act email is so basic and primitive looking, you  can't put attractive auto signatures on it.  Then they tell you that you can have one month of telephone support, but it's only available during work days, not on the weekends.  Since I purchased the product on the weekend, I won't be able to speak with someone to ask for a full refund until Monday.  I've used this product for 24 hours and I'm giving up.  What a waste of time and money.  How does this company survive with such a bad product?    If anyone knows of a good CRM program for a small business, please share.      
 I was surprised when I took this class that I did not like this book.  All of my epid profs highly recommended this text.  You have to flip back and forth when you are doing the problems because they list the SAS output that you need once in one chapter.  I know it saves space, but this can get maddening.  I did not find the examples clearly written at all-the lack of fit test, and some of the stuff about partial F tests could have used a few more sentences.    No, I cannot write a glowing review of the text, but the only reason for the second star is because I also had a terrible instructor for this course.  Perhaps if Dr. Kleinbaum had taught this to me, I would have a different perspective of this book.  However, I was pretty much teaching myself this material, and this book is not designed for that. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you wouldn't feel bad?  Have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him? In this story, the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he's still a "good guy" because "good guys" don't do bad things.  Dizzing logic, huh?  Throughout the novel, you review his senior year of high school with him.  It starts out with the story of how he got the nickname "Killer" to why it's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue.  The flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he didn't rape her.  He won't let her leave the room until she believes it.  The ending is less than satisfactory for me.  I would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice 
 I am an RN student and this is the worst textbook I have had.  The ideas in it are really scattered, so it is difficult to find anything in it.  The chapters are extensive, for no reason and with minimal content 
 I read this book on the advice of a review in the science journal, Nature.  But I must say that it is, at best, a monotonous, plot-free read. There is virtually no history of science here, no gripping detective story or expose, and it is certainly far from engrossing.  There are no personalities involved, little sensitivity to history, and so nothing to grab one's interest.  Except for the first chapter (concerning a law suit over a stolen copy), the rest of the book pretty much consists of a dry, bare-boned littany of the author's survey of extant copies of Copernicus' great treatise, De Revolutionibus.  There are a few entertaining comments about Edward Rosen (another historian of science fascinated with Copernican minutiae )that smack of professional rivalry (or perhaps a generational shift in science history studies?).  The rest of the chapters consist of lifeless prose on boring topics, with an rambling commentary on the then-current Cold War.  The book is tedious because it fails to breathe life into its topic.  But then, how could it? For it is little more than a glorified list of copies.  It took nearly all my gumption (not to mention a looong layover in Chicago O'Hare Airport) to even finish the book.  Stick to the highlights (Chapters 1-3, Plate 1a, and the photo on p. 198 of Galileo's horoscope for Cosmo d'Medici) and you'll have about all there is worth having here. 
 for non writers who manipulate everything to suit their conceptions.  the FACTS completely debunk this book.  Thankfully, these men will fade; the true mysteries remain unanswered waiting, perhaps, for someone without personal gain to cull through, define and present.  What a nasty book 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff

 My sons got this toy for their 1st birthday since their physical therapist recommended getting a push/ride on toy with a wide base for learning to walk.  While they enjoy the buttons and sounds and like being pushed around on it, I do not find it helpful for development.  The handle pushes forward and comes off very easily, it is not heavy enough for them to pull up on without tipping over onto them, and the seat is very wide and square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they would be able to ride it.  Also some of the stickers are starting to peel off and we've only had it a month.  For an older child it would probably make a decent ride on toy, but if you are wanting a push toy to help with early walking, keep looking 
 "Understanding Comics" was a great thesis with a profound delivery back in 1993, and earned McCloud his current cult status amoung comic readers and creators.    "Reinventing Comics" explores the new medium as a viable source for all of us peasant small press creators who are shunned by the gatekeepers in the hegemonious field of comics.    On the internet, however, McCloud is either revered or despised.  I have nothing against him personally, but I do have issues with the impractical idealism present in Reinventing Comics.    Since the publication of THIS book, we've experienced the Dot.com bust and are now on the verge of FCC style control of the internet as a whole.    Like the creators of "Penny Arcade" commented on their blog in 2005, "the 'infinite canvas' is a new way for artists to be poor".   There have been, at best, a dozen webcomic creators (out of more than 20,000 who are current and still going) have actually made enough revenue to be substantial, and only three that I know of who make a living exclusively from webcomics.   McCloud's book also helped end net neutrality for webcomics, because since its publication, there have been several clusters of webcomic "review, submit, tow the party line, give up your intellectual property" sites that have sprung up to crystalize something that was once public access, and could carry its own weight without some self-appointed net-elitist steering the audience to or away.    My second gripe with the book -   McCloud strongly feels that the next generation will be bigger and better inventors in the mostly unexplored territory of webcomics.  I cross-plug my own webcomic on MySpace, where kids the age of Scott's currently mingle.  As far as I can tell, this next generation is even less creative than the former, still stuck in the 2D art form, and they don't even bother to learn anything outside of basic coding in order to enhance their sites in the way McCloud suggests they will.  Why should they?  this isn't 1995, and the younger are a little to nativized to internet culture to learn its mechanics.  It's my generation that plowed the fields and charted the territory of the internet, and the younger are only enjoying the spoils.     Webcomics will be around as long as the internet remains public, but they didn't exist just because someone from the establishment wrote a book about them. Experimental and interactive comics were around before the internet, on that thing we once called the CD-Rom, and before that, the rudimentary pixilated floppy-disc action adventure games with comic elements.  This isn't anything NEW, it's just the graphic technology has caught up with the aesthetic.   The book gets two stars because he did put effort into its delivery, just like Understanding Comics, but I can't say that it was informative, enlightening, or anything but fluff and repetition from Understanding Comics.   
 I was offended by the "humor" in the book.  At one point she refers to the babies of mothers who could not breastfeed in a certain culture and states that the babies would usually die, but that at least they were spared a lifetime of gastrointestinal illnesses. I pretty much put the book down after reading that.  In general, I found the book to be overly preachy, and there was nothing new in the advice 
 I purchased the book in hopes to further my knowledge of application of the SPC to Engineering Process Control (EPC).  I found one article, somehow useful, about application of the EWMA (Chapter 11).  This book is a  collection of article, more less like proceedings for an academic  convention.  Not much practical hints, neither is a tutorial 
 In my never-ending quest for the next comic novel, and spurred on by the plethora of enthusiastic reviews here, I knew I wanted to read "Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom." I imagined that the book was along the lines of something written by Christopher Moore ("The Island of the Sequined Love Nun") or Bill Fitzhugh ("Pest Control"). Alas, I was wrong ...  Twenty-one-year-old Duncan Delaney lives with his mother, Fiona, on the family ranch in Wyoming. Duncan isn't pressed by want, and so he's able to indulge his hobby--painting on black velvet canvas. One day, Duncan's best friend, Arapaho, Benjamin Lonetree sells one of Duncan's paintings for the grand sum of $600. The buyer, an attractive dealer in Los Angeles leaves her business card and expresses great interest in Duncan's talent. So Duncan takes the hint, leaves his high school sweetheart, Tiffany behind (no great hardship), and heads for Hollywood in a tatty old VW bus.   Once in Hollywood, our innocent, country cowboy hero (who sleeps with his Stetson over his face) has a series of adventures ...  Basically, "Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom" is a romance. The novel may be coated with a veneer of the trailer-trash genre, but it boils down to a romance, swaddled with some intrigue, and ne'er do well types. This novel reads better than a Harlequin romance, but with lines such as: "laughing lips that had never felt the needle's collagen sting," and "she was not the swiftest deer in the concrete forest," you should get my point. In all fairness, I should point out that I generally do not read romances, so I was destined to be disappointed in this novel. But for other potential readers, the overwhelming romance aspect of this novel should be mentioned. I did, however, enjoy the character of Benjamin Lonetree. He was an original creation in the novel--displacedhuman 
 This book covers a huge range of Irish names, however only provides minimal information on each and coat of arms for the select few.  It provided the same information that is easily found on the web 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 I have just spent over one hour scrubbing my toddler's hands from this permanent ink!

Now I have to continue scubbing... 
 I've purchased and listened to ALL of the previous recordings by both the principals of this recording. I've never found ANY of them irritating and annoying. But this recording I can't listen to more than 3 tracks. I may regret this review, and it may not be helpful to you, but all I hear is busy, busy, busy playing in a tiny, narrow range of texture, grooves, and expression. Sometimes with a recording, I instantly feel "what a great session". And sometimes I instantly feel, "what a misguided session". I may try to listen to it in the car or some different setting, I mean, I SHOULD be able to hear something here .. 
 This book is basically a series of quoted and sited magazine articles hastily cobbled together into a book.  The only "real" interviews done by the author are with a few eBay customers who use the site.  The author admits no one with eBay granted him an interview or let him in the building.  For a much better story of how eBay came to be, read eBoys by Robert Stross 
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
 This terrible and dull album launched the career of Über-nothing violinist, Vanessa Mae.  It is hard to describe the depth of the level to which this album stoops to be "popular". Low brow? You bet! Exploitative? Oh yeah! Dumbed down Classical Music? Well, that's what we've got here!  Value of this album? Hard to say. I am sure that Vanessa's parents and agent are happy with this prosaic product.  Very dumbed down dumb music - for the legions of philistines and musically naive of the world.     In one word, a "dud". 
 I was forced to read this book in my Junior Health class in High school. The book is interesting enough and easy to read. Any reading level can understand this book.   The plot revolves around Nick Andreas, who has received a restraining order against his ex-girlfriend Caitlin after hitting her. The story shifts between present day Nick dealing with his anger management class and filling out a journal. Those journal entries provide inside into the past, highlighting Nick and Caitlin's relationship while it was still "happy".   It was a constant reminder throughout the whole book that the author who wrote this book has no idea how teenagers actually speak. Being one myself, I have firsthand experience. It's not as if the characters use words that no normal one would use, it's just the manner in which they present themselves. Frankly, most of the dialog is just uninteresting and unrealistic.  My other complaint are Nick's journals. He writes them so perfectly detailed that it seems like they are happening in present day. He even uses quotes and "she/he said" to cap them off. I find it extremely hard to believe that any teenager will be that in-depth with a journal entry, treating it as if they were writing a novel.  I commend the book for dealing with such tough issues as control problems and child abuse but any brave steps taken to deal with these or short cut with the ridiculously formulaic ending that made the whole book feel like a worn-out after-school special.   Overall, the book is not the worst in the world but it definitely could have been better. I could have written a book better than this in my sleep 
 although the usual elements are there--defender of the faithful searching the heart of darkness (his own) at a crucial point in life (middle age); the good-as-gold woman who gets away; the woman who doesn't--sprinkled with stories cops tell each other. But it drags, as if written to a formula not fully developed. Wambaugh writes well, part Hemingway, part Joseph Conrad. But this adventure story for men misses in all but the gastronomical department 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 As much as I enjoy listening to Placido Domingo's popular recordings this is not one of his best performances. Missing the full-blooded belting that can be heard on his other albums ("Be My Love" for example). The orchestration is very mediocre and uninspired. For a romantic mood, "Perhaps Love" (simply fabulous) is much better choice.  
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette

 I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.  And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then "the False Prophet")   People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear. 
 I have had several people take my pictures.At first,everything is fine.The pictures are ok.THE NEXT DAY,my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.It is soooo blury.Then it got 2 the point where every picture I took was blury.I tried fixing it online(like on the program for the camera)and it would not work.I HATE THIS CAMERA!!! Not to mention the battery sucks.It lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours.This camera should be $99.00.TRUST ME PEOPLE......IF I COULD RATE THIS THING AT A ZERO I WOULD.IT IS NOT WORTH IT.HOWEVER,a camera i absolutely love is the Sony Cybershot DSCT5.An awesome little camera 
 Does NOT maintain water temp. Splashes all over AT the proper water level. Rollers hurt. Noisy. Weak vibrations. I wouldn't want one for $5 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 This novel is set in same universe as the Miles Vorkosigan series, but about 200 years before the birth of Miles, so connected very loosely to the main series.  Main character Leo Graf is an engineer who is assigned to the quaddie project - quaddies being bioengineered humanoid workers who are specialized in freefall work because they have 4 arms rather than 2 arms and 2 legs. I've become a Bujold fan after reading a handful of Miles Vorkosigan novels, but this is by far the weakest novel I've read by the author. The plot is very thin and extremely predictable, the characters are flat, and if not for Bujold's talent in keeping the story moving and the dialogue lively, I would have ditched this book after 100 pages 
 Up front. This series of books is great. It's the closest thing we have these days to a true Indiana Jones-like adventure with a little 007 thrown in. Fun stuff and Dirk Pitt is just plain cool. That being said on with the review of this book....  This book is VERY dated and it shows. Very sexist. Very homophobic.  Cussler's books should never be taken as anything but, entertainment so we can't blast them too much.  This is early on in Clive's writing career so the dialogue and  some of the scenes are lacking. However, there are parts were you'll see the character and the writer showing glimpses of where they will be someday. The action throughout the book is awesome although what Pitt wears near the end to observe and later fight the enemy was a bit much. The shocker ending was a little strange as well. I don't want to put this down too much and give the wrong impression of the series. So, take a big Cussler fan's advice and read this one later than the others. 
 What a load of turnspeak.  G. Orwell (deceased 
 This book has nothing to do with demonic possession. This is a book about a woman suffering from a personality disorder. It leads the reader on a detailed, longwinded, rambling journey of the woman's self-discovery on the root source of her disorder with the help of a psychologist.      This book is more aptly titled: "cholecimla: a study of multiple personality disorder."   Numerous typo errors were encountered in this book.  
 I am nine years old and I had to read this book for school. I do not recomend this slow moving, dull book for you. This is more like pre-k reading level. I hope you like my report 
 Hawaii for Dummies was not usable and light when it came to driving details.  We should have splurged and bought a book for each of the islands we visited:  Kauai, Oahu and Maui.  Now you know 
 This video shows absolutely NO detail and barely skims the surface  regarding each technique.  Then it wastes a lot of time with a rambling  interviewing of Jack Grout.  This video definitely falls short of what it  claims to do 
 I have all of her previous books and I have to admit that I am getting a little tired of her cookbooks. I have used her first two books numerous times and the recipes are no fail. However, with the more recent ones and especially this last one, I am beginning to fill that her repertoire needs some refreshing. There is nothing new and exciting here and I have encountered and excecuted extremely close version of these recipes from a number of other chefs/cookbook writers. Let us hope for something better in the future 
 I would not recommend this book.  It covers some individual cabling components, but it does not have a coherent review chapter that explains "How" to run cable through a building.   It does not cover different situations that might arise in running cable and doesn't have tips on things like, avoiding electric cables and plumbing, how to ensure you have enough cable for the job, etc.  Again, it documents individual components, but it does not cover much of "How" to run cable.  The book does have pointers spread throughout the book, such as dropping a metal bead chain down a stud cavity, then inserting a magnet into the outlet box hole to retrieve the bead chain.  After that, you can attach a pull string to run the cat5 cable.  However, this book seems very disorganized.  It sprinkles tips throughout unrelated chapters.  It repeats concepts frequently in different chapters, and sometimes the repeated topics have discrepancies.  For example, one chapter mentions patch cables should not exceed 10 feet, and a different chapter says patch cables should not exceed 15 feet.  I would NOT recommend this book if you're wanting to learn "How" to run cable.  I would also not recommend this book for anyone wanting to run cable in residential buildings.  This book covers commercial buildings almost exclusively. 
 That's okay, Junior, we're just going to put the Lion King away for a little while (puts DVD in trash as kid cries, screaming).  There, see? He's just going to sleep. Now let's go sit over here and talk about why mommy put the Lion King to sleep (kid still screaming). See, honey, the Lion King is a movie that is made by bad, evil people. Even though the Lion King is cute and the cartoons are nice to look at, the people who drew the animals want to do VERY BAD things to you. They want you to HATE yourself, and you know what? These people are EVERYWHERE WE LOOK. They aren't just in the Lion King, they're on your school bus, in your classroom, and in the cafeteria. They might even be your teacher. They might even be people who call you their friend and say you're pretty. Even when they say you're pretty, they're just saying those things to make themselves feel good. What they're really trying to say is that they HATE you and they want to HURT you!! (kid screams again, now scarred for life) Now let's talk about how Mulan says bad things about Asian people, how The Incredibles reinforces stereotypes of female inferiority, about how Buzz Lightyear destabilizes the corporate-controlled capitalist economy that subjugates the Black race, and how Finding Nemo is homophobic. And don't worry, mommy will tell you about these big words after you eat your bean pie, child. Power to the people! 
 I bought this for my 3 year old son based on the user reviews.  I was expecting more activities, but there's just one nut and one wrench.  You can imagine doing different tasks on each page, but it's still the same nut and the same wrench.  My son lost interest after a short time and hasn't been interested in picking it back up since.  This is surprising to be because he's a big Cars fan and loves working with other plastic tool sets he has.  I guess this is the downside of buying things sight-unseen over the Internet.  Had I seen it in person I probably would have passed on it 
 [the above is an actual quote from the book]  I don't usually read romances, but got this one at the library.  I thought: Thriller.  Hijacked plane, navy seal...all the right stuff.  And the beginning was promising.  Stan fixes everything, and has a human side to him that was compelling.  Then the plot hit the fan!  As a thriller it stunk.  The highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly, as an after thought.  The romantic "tension" between the protagonists was forced and irritating.  The dialogue is mundane.  The message that horniness leads to true romantic (Sam and Alyssa) love is rubbish.  The only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl, and I think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed.  The historic (WWII) componant was interesting.  But overall, I kept asking who the audience is for this book.  Not lovers of thrillers like me--and I wonder, do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane, or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether Teri will ever tell Sam that she loves him! 
 By the title of this book you would think that there would be more about the involvement of the Knights Templar and The Holy Grail, but there is very little mention of either.    There is a good deal of information on Rennes Le Chateau, however you can find any of the information in this book in any other book that is about the Rennes mystery, without having to deal with the author talking in circles and repeating himself.  It seems to me that the author wrote the book more to give his opinion on other authors, which I find extremely disappointing to say the least.  Not worth the effort to read it 
 As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening. 
 I've read and enjoyed all the StarFIST novels. This is one of them in name only. It starts like a typical Starfist novel and even ties in some references to Charlie Bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends.  I never did figure out what the author's point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash. The men of the FIST are hard working, hard fighting Marines who trace an honorable history back to the US Marines of the 19th & 20th century. These "Force Recon" marines are a ruthless bunch of screw-ups who could trace their ancestry back to the Waffen SS.  Rather than root for them I soon found myself rooting for the opposition. They invade a fellow member of the confederation, screw-up their primary assignment, fail to get the info they were sent for, kill allied soldiers and airmen, murder helpless civilian prisoners, and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state.  Someone should remind the authors that Recon is about getting accurate, timely, information. It's not about blowing things up.  I really wasted my money on this book, I definitely won't be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle. 
 Definately doesn't live up to What to Expect the First Years.  Somethings are written very vaguely, if at all.  Recently we were looking up hives - nothing!!!!  Just a blurb.  Sorry Arlene Eisenberg, you need to take your time with these books and include everything before you just send it to the presses 
 An interpretation of science is not science and should not be presented as such.  I read this book and wasn't persuaded otherwise, thus I was displeased 
 I am the original King LaBrue out of the camp of Kool Herc and the Herculoids.  Before there was Sugar Hill and 50 Cent, there was King LaBrue--to this day still represents true hip-hop.  I plan to write my own account of the true pioneers that should be respected for dedication and commitment for all these years.  
 I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater, owning all their studio albums, and some singles. I loved SFAM, I&W, SDOIT, and Awake. After their peak at SFAM, I didn't expect them to release anything better. But I didn't expect them to release anything that was too bad.  They did.  Octavarium, flat out, isn't Dream Theater. No guitar or drum solos, not flourishes, no pretenstious and self-indulgent metal peices. Buy this if you like U2 or Coldplay, don't buy it if you like Dream Theater. 
 ... the subject matter is very intriging and deservesattention. However, Ms. Chang's book has no real insight into Tsien'slife.... The actual writting is also lackingg. The book is filled with dragging sentences that fails to excite the reader. I only recommand this book to readers who do not know anything about Chinese history or Tisen. It is to be used as an general and elementry reference only. Even then, there are still many holes... 
 I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be "ruggedly handsome"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war 
 "The Sound and The Fury" is reported as one of William Faulkner's early successes.  From this performance I have trouble understanding why.  The book alternates between dialogue and descriptive narration.  I had trouble following the story.  It sounded like a series of barely related scenes.  I did listen to a recording of this book.  I do have more trouble following recordings of fiction than I do with history.  It may be that I would do better reading this book than listening to it.  There was nothing technically wrong with the recording, I am just hopeful that a written version would be more understandable.  I would recommend giving a written version at try 
   I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality 
 Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended 
 I had pretty high expectation of this book.  Unfortnately I was disapointed.  With the exception of the chapter dealing with how to navigate through towns and cities there was nothing that hasn't been written about a thousand times before. Along with the fact that everything was written as though you've never seen a bicycle before.  What's up with that!?!  It's not totally with out merit if you've never done any distance bicycling.  But there are certainly better books out there that cover the same material and in a much more entertaining fashion.  I suggest you look else where for your bike touring information 
 It's rare when I can't finsih a book, but I tried in vain with this for a month and couldn't end it.  The author spends far too much time going into detail about a small part of John Dee's life, and seems to lose presepctive about Dee's contributions.  We get too much of his court intrigues and that can get mighty dull.  This book could have benefitted form being a good deal shorter 
 Full disclosure:  I'm a guy, and I read this book at a time when, in my early 20's, I was trying to understand, and come to grips with, my perception that several of my relationships with women (some strictly platonic, some not) were crippled by a certain lack of honesty.  So feel free to discount my reaction to this book by whatever degree you feel appropriate, based on the perspective I brought to it. That said, I was disappointed and frustrated by what I found to be Lerner's somewhat shallow and defensive treatment of the topic.  I'm oversimplifying a bit, but Lerner's basic philosophy, as presented in the book, seems to be:  Dishonesty is often a good thing because not sharing hurtful truths can help you avoid hurting someone's feelings.  E.g., not telling a friend that you think certain behavior patterns are harmful or unpleasant serves the "greater truth" that you nevertheless care about her and think she's a good person.  Therefore, Lerner suggests, women who deceive the other people in their lives often aren't "really" lying, they're just being kind.  Lerner doesn't really confront the ultimately circular nature of this argument.  Nor does she provide any reasoned way of distinguishing between innocuous applications of this "if you mean well, it isn't really a lie" approach and more problematic ones.  Telling a friend that you really like her disastrous new haircut, about which she's feeling self-conscious and vulnerable, is one thing.  Not telling her that you've been deliberately excluding her from certain social situations because your other friends find her manipulative or overly critical is something else entirely.  Nor does Lerner, IMHO, deal meaninfully with the question of whether deception that we rationalize on the grounds that it protects a friend from unpleasantness is not often, in reality, an attempt to protect ourselves from the emotional messiness of communicating hard truths.  These aren't easy issues, and I don't claim to know the "truth", or even that there is a single correct approach to dealing with them.  But I was disappointed by Lerner's failure to grapple honestly with them 
 it's a so-so film with Rourke in the IRA. Some good stuff. Look for Anthony(Stewart Head) as Rupert(note: Anthony Stewart Head portraits another Rupert...Rupert Giles on the TV show Buffy The Vampire Slayer)so, now you know. but this one is so-so like I sai 
 If the US wants to torture prisoners they should force them to read this poorly written book.  Very unimpressive writing that makes the book hard to follow 
     Well in the beginning of the early dvd stages movie studios were adepting anyways. I had this film on laserdisc and its orgnial oar was 2.35:1 so whats the problem universal. As many films in there library the shadow also was in widescreen in laserdisc also maybe in the future universal will start producing more titles in there widescreen products. Even more studios double dipping these days thats what i call a re-release of a film special editions blah blah better late then never right or trying to make the ppl spend more money when they double dip or dont wanna spend the extra time and quaily and money even bad movies get nice transfers look at the newly released gymkata geez. But universal its 2007 jump on the widescreen bandwagon from all the older release you've released from the beginning twins,timecop,the shadow,kindergaten cop,i'm putting faith in you now give the ppl what the ppl really want thanks for reading 
 I would have.  I have never read Danielle Steel, and once I went to pick up a book of hers and saw that it was priced above the normal amount for a paperback.  I put it down, assuming she must be really good, but as I hadn't read anything by her, I wasn't willing to pay extra to do so.  Well, I got Safe Harbor from my local library on audiobook and figured I'd give her a try.    As I listened to this novel, I got very tired of the amateur lack of descriptiveness, and of the redundancy.  I noticed that a few things were said over and over again throughout the novel, like the fact that she had so much to do before the tragedy, and now... afterward she had too much free time, and even though things were hard before, she'd rather have the "business" of a mentally ill son and a husband that didn't care about her.  As if the readers wouldn't remember, or as if we didn't get her point the first 3 times. Many things were repeated like that, and I felt like I was listening to a fifth grade creative writing assignment where the student had to meet a word requirement and didn't have enough content.     Ophelie is weak, simple, and boring, as is Matt.  They have no personality.  The version I am listening to is the unabridged verson, so I can't possibly be just missing something.  I understand that this is supposedly a novel of triumph and the will to survive, but she didn't even care for her child, and it had been a year.  Perhaps these things do happen in real life, but I'd much rather read about women with some semblance of a spine. It should have been one or the other, Ophelie's husband should have been worth mourning so thoroughly.   I assumed this must have been one of her very first novels for it to be so blah, but I checked the publication date... and I'm in shock.    Perhaps Danielle Steel feels she is above having to deliver a quality novel with her fame, I can't begin to understand how such a reknown author could release something so terrible. 
 It's been over twenty years, and still to this day no one has been able to match the thunder from Frank Miller's THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.  As to why, that's open to debate... perhaps it's because when Miller took up Batman he was at his lowest point, and with nothing to lose, bet it all on black and won.  Miller managed to not only push Batman forward (in both time and storytelling) but pull him back from the brink as well - like Batman does time and time again on the page, death gets but a taste, but never it's fill of Batman.  And because of that, anything anyone tries with Batman tends to suffer from the echo of that thunder.  Paul Pope's BATMAN: YEAR 100 tries to have it both ways - borrowing the dystopian view from DARK KNIGHT, while lifting the origin style from BATMAN: YEAR ONE and tries to fuse them together into one book and have it, somehow, make some kind of sense... it doesn't.  The story is cardboard (and often cheap), the characters are pale copies (or distant relations) of their originals (all of whom occupy the same roles or positions of power or importance within the BATMAN UNIVESE for no other reason than that's the way it's always been - luckluster and unimaginative), and while Pope tries to sell us on the mystery as to who this Batman really is - you end up not caring.  It's just a tepid 24 set within the BATMAN world.  You'll have a hundred questions by the time you reach the final page - but forget getting any answers, there's none to be found.  As for the art - it's a TWO FACE coin toss here - you'll either love it or hate it.  I happened to have loved it.  Pope really knows how to pace his action, and when Batman is on the go here - this book zips (in fact, it almost zips too fast - you'll quickly come to realize how thin the story is after you sail through all the action, only for the book to come to a dead stop when it comes to the talk), and some of his action poses for Batman are wonderful... but it doesn't save the book.  For the curious, give it a try, enjoy the art - but for the die-hard fans... we're still children of the thunder and BATMAN: YEAR 100 is just a pale shadow 
 After purchasing this Cd, I was less than impressed with the whole thing, all the way through. Ann's voice just doesn't have the umpth to really stand out and be "original" as everyone is saying about her. A majority of the songs have the same dance beat, which becomes very annoying around the third or fourth track. All the tracks are all very similar and her high waif like voice doesn't capture my attention. There's absolutely no soul to this CD. 2 times isn't even that good of a start out single 
 A mildly better read than Rochefort's first book, "French Toast" (which is so infuriating it's difficult to finish), and of somewhat broader scope, this one manages to be both meandering and repetitive as well as occasionally self-contradictory in her supposed observations. Inserted snippets from other writers only serve to highlight the lack of depth in both her observations and her choice of corroborating comments (which often don't corroborate!). It is amazing that she has lived so long in Paris and retained so narrow a focus. This book is really a waste of time 
 Treats some of the stories of the Civil War in the west without explaining the larger issues.  This is an inexpensive book, but not necessarily a good value 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 I have a hefty tortoise-shell Manx who is constantly shedding.  I saw the commercial for this product, and the gobs of hair it removed from the animals, and just had to have one.  Boy, was I ever disappointed!  When I try to brush my cat with it, the teeth just float on top of her hair... they don't even go down into the undercoat.  Maybe it's because she's chubby, I don't know, but it sure doesn't work for her.  I'm left handed, so I had to turn the blade the other way on the handle.  Maybe I'm not using it right.  I'm still very disappointed.  The animals they show on television must have not been brushed in years for them to get that amount of fur off of them 
 I bought and used this book for a probability class and for preparation for the Society of Actuaries (SOA) exam course 1.  I had never had a probability or statistics class and this book did a very poor job of helping me to understand the topics.  I had to resort to using other books not required for the class in order to understand anything.  I did not pass the the SOA exam and I blame that, in part, on this stupid book.  I also had about 50 class mates, all of which had just as much disgust for the book as I did.  Not disgust for the class but for the book 
 Although the revised editions of the Nancy Drew books never lived up to the originals in my opinion, the writing was always decent...But then around volumes #27-#30, it really started to decline,and became what I call poor quality. It seemed as if the writer('s) really did'nt care what thier readers would think of thier work, just as long a they got thier pay check, they were happy. And the art is atroucious! The cover paintings arent too bad, but its the illustrations inside the books that really show the lazziness of the artist. I really liked the original illustrater's (which was Russel Tandy) approach. He would first actually read the whole book before going to work, unlike Nappi who would doodle a few pencil drawings that looked as if they came from a generic color book from Big Lots... I dispies this garbage.. 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 This book has nothing common with the classical English style if you are looking for it. It has dark, gloomy and boring room photographs. But, it has a useful information in the introduction part as it explains the history and challenges in English decoration style from early periods until now 
 Melissa was just an average gossip reporter for a NYC newspaper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Fortunately her elderly next door neighbor was attacked in her home and left for Mel to find unconscious and barely breathing.  Mel, being the kind, neighborly girl she is, took to taking care of the woman's pets and set to getting in contact with her only living relative.  Her heinous, photographer nephew, Max.  After hearing of his aunt's accident, Max decided it was more important to spend a few weeks in Florida with a supermodel.  In his place, he sent an old college friend who owed him a favor.  John Trent, a trust fund millionaire, was called in to stay at Max's house and pretend to be Max.  After spending time together Mel and "Max" begin to fall i love, creating quite a mix up.  All in all it's a cute book, but I hate that the entire book consists of correspondance through emails 
 Cannot remember a reading a worse book.  Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue.  The only good think about it is that it is very short 
 I read the review for this product on Amazon. Lindsey who is one of the 2 reviewers of this product actually had posted a video of the product usage and I was very much convinced by that. I thought the product is good and ordered it immediately. The product arrived in 4-5 days and was in good condition.   The most important problem with the roti maker is  1. the roti/tortilla is not cooked properly. It remains very much uncooked. Even though you see it puff and everything from the inside it remains uncooked which actually causes a lot of acidity problems.   2. Also such an uncooked tortilla when left for a few minutes becomes very dry and difficult to eat. You have to eat the tortilla immediately within 10-15 minutes of the making. Just imagine if you are making 5-7 tortillas the first one will be come dry and difficult to chew.  3. The product works as described but the tortillas are not at all good for health since they remain uncooked in the inside 
 Reading the title and description of this book, I was excited about reading it. I found the writing not up to the task! Despite having a great deal of interest in the subject, after scanning the book I decided not to read it 
 An "ok" movie with a GREAT ,but overlooked soundtrack.The music is perfect to use with work-outs.Next to "Rocky" this music "will take you HIGHER"!! 
 Echoing --corinne--'s review, this book was too...I guess you can say "perfect".  There was the bad boy, dark, sensual Lucien who wanted to be saved by the beautiful, innocent, but lusty Alice.  The demon and the angel.  Even the book states that..My first Gaelen Foley book was "The Duke" and I loved the less-than-perfect..more realistic but strong characters.  I was disappointed to read the flat, weak characters in "Lord of Fire"..so much that I stopped around halfway through the book.  
 People who listen to the Goldberg Variations on piano must live in a parallel universe. Liquid legato? Three minutes of passion? There is no other set of variations of any era for any instrument more "structurally" conceived and unified than the Goldbergs! It's all or nothing, not a string of pearls. Please, please, listen to the harpsichord performances of Trevor Pinnock or Bob van Asperen before you spend money on another pianist's misconception. Ms Tureck's performance, by the way, is particularly inchoate. If you must have piano, try Richard Goode 
 This is one of those unfortunate attempts to translate a tremendous book into a two-hour movie. Good try but it didn't work. The Cruel Sea is one of the greatest novels to come out of World War II and a must read for anyone who ever lived on a ship. But the characters are too complex, the war too long and the sea too treacherous to be captured in a short film. They would have been better advised to develop one or two incidents in the novel 
 I wanted to like this album, but it simply doesn't compare to Leftism. Leftism was way ahead of it's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas Rhythm & Stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to. This is my synopsis and apparently I'm not alone as this CD sells for much cheaper on the used market than Leftism.  My advice? Don't miss Leftism but skip Rhythym & Stealth 
 All the nice things said in the other reviews are reasonably true, but sheesh!  Electronica offers infinite options for percussion - it does not HAVE to be trite, incredibly monotonous, and synthetic sounding.  This is the bane of so much electronica, it's a joke.  Nothing with a petty-swingin' rhythm can be good.  I would give this album four or five stars if I could just erase the silly percussion tracks - almost identical in half the songs.  Get the Karma album instead 
 Seems like Kurupt duz really good with out DDDDDaz!  Throw Back Muzic'86 was the only good hit on this whole Death Row Album, and you can't even sample it!?  Like Eazy, "I be like Scrappy Loco, cause Kurupt be yellin' Long Beach Rollin' 6-0 Blood & Puppy Pound Crip? Really Doe!  Nutz On Ya Chin, All Up in this Philly Hoe!" -Eazy-E (Wut Would U Do?)  Anywayz, Against The Grain really is watered down compared to Kurupt's previous albums!  Death Row Records present day, Petey Pablo (Blast!), Young Eastwood (Blast!), Suga Knight (Blast!), and that wanna be Locc Kurupt (Blast! Blast!), he was never 2pac's friend like Snoop Doggy Dogg was anywayz!  Plus MC Eiht, Outlawz, Coolio, RBX and Kurupts old' partner DDaz has better solo albums than Kurupt!  This album is a disgrace to West Coast hip hop, so ya know whats good for ya! (LOL! 
 A dull, tedious, melodramatic effort that wastes the cast and the craft of scene setting.  Everything goes out the window once people start moving and talking and it takes hours for the story to reach the predictable non-conclusion.  The film is laden with cliches and burdened by a lack of focus.  Pick a story out of here and you can make 20 films, but don't throw together teasers and expect everyone to appreciate the slow-mo trainwreck of family tragedies that this movie encompasses 
 I'm a Wilbur Smith fan, so I bought this DVD thinking it would be interesting...silly me...are movies EVER comparable to the books?  Despite the excellent cast, the acting was third rate and the movie came across as sort of Danielle Steelish, not Wilbur Smith.  Given the talent involved in the film, the film makers could have done MUCH better 
 You got Tupac Shakur (Gridlock'd, Bullet) in his last movie before his death, which he shows some very good acting skills might I say and then on the other side you got a chubby and overly miscast James Belushi (Destiny Turns On The Radio, The Florentine) sprouting a top hat threw the movie. These 2 cops sell cocaine to dealers, kill them and then throw away the drugs but they make a mistake when they kill a DEA Agent instead of a dealer. Things spiral down from there in this edgy urbanesque action thriller. Not much when the story is hammy. Also starring Dennis Quaid (Frequency, The Day After Tomorrow), Lela Rochon (The Big Hit, Waiting To Exhale), David Paymer (Quiz Show, Payback), James Earl Jones (Field Of Dreams, Empire Strikes Back), Gary Cole (A Simple Plan, Office Space) and Wendy Crewson (Air Force One) 
 Listening to this mix of "All This Time" reminds me of the old days with the trusty AM radio trying to make out a tune from a distant station with atmospheric interferences.    There are all kinds of reasons to remix songs, but generally you'd think the aim would be to improve them somehow.  The incoherent racket inserted into these selections has done nothing but make them all but impossible to endure.  I guess it shows that just because you can mix doesn't mean you should.  And just because you do doesn't mean you have the talent to do so successfully.  This CD gives its proud owner not the chore of choosing which selection is best, but which one is least lousy.  This CD stinks to high heaven 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 My DJ side: I actually had to stop the music, open the tray on the CD player then check whether I had the right CD1 down-tempo in, or some other CD that my wife played before as the music was so not what I was expecting, sounding more like Deep Forest than JVM. To my surprise, it was Jimmy's Balance 10. I decided to Keep an open mind and listen to it anyway. I went to sleep after the 4th track. The next day I decided to listen to the second CD (mid tempo). Again I stopped the music, opened the tray on the CD player then checked whether I had the (mid tempo CD) in instead of the down-tempo I was playing the night before. Sure enough, the (mid tempo) was what I had in the player, but did not sound much different than the lullabies I was listening to on CD1. When the mid-tempo was over, I thought to myself "well, this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner with friends". The next day I had high hopes for the up tempo CD, cause well, as the name implies, it should be where the beats and treats are. But No. Not really.   The only reason I didn't freak out from listening to the 1st and 2nd CD of Jimmy Van M's Balance release is because for three days I kept telling myself that there is an up tempo CD. I didn't mind CD1&2 out of place pop tracks, I didn't mind the different types of music being played in sequence, or rather, out of sequence. I didn't mind hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel I stayed in two years ago in Vienna. All this will be forgivable when I hear the up-tempo, because I was so sure it's going to be awesome. Unfortunately, I was not quite right about my assumptions. Things did not start happening until track 5 (The Reducer 2), I don't really need some 4 tracks on the third CD to get me warmed up. Jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that, in his down + mid-tempo crap. For the most part, this production of the Balance series - especially the first 41 tracks in sequence - churned out some of the most lethargic, way too slow and boring music that could be described, at best, as lullabies for grown ups. As for the last 9 tracks of the up-tempo, it is actually - dare I say - decent enough, but way too late, and even worse, ended prematurely. It should have been re-arranged with tracks in reverse order on every CD to be as follows: (CD3) up-tempo should have been (CD1) renamed (in the car from club to home), (CD2) mid-tempo should have been renamed (at home in the living room) and finally (CD1) down-tempo should have been (CD3) renamed (in your bedroom).  This just makes more sense.  The reason I say this is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to us (9) to the rest of the sleepy, mellow ones (41). For example, chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two then goes on to be slower gradually. I have never come across a chill CD that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow ones, that's not chill. JVM Balance did exactly that; took forever to ascend to a certain point, then crashed almost immediately. What gives?    Half star for CD1 Half star for CD2 3 stars for CD3  My human side: Dance music is not the only type of beautiful music out there, Duh! Jimmy made that very clear in this release. If you want to listen to a wide range of (not bad!) music, then Balance 10 is for you. Dive in JVM selection of what he thinks makes us human; expressions of the soul that goes beyond our daily necessities to survive. As a matter of fact, we don't even need music (or any type of arts for that matter) to survive at all. Still we listen to it, we crave it and for many people their livelihood depends on it. Music can represent our feelings, desires and wishes, and with JVM Deep Forest like music here (as I mentioned before) I can't help but wonder if he is going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and oneness with the world is a priority. I think it shows. 
 With a good script and a director better suited to the material (I've read Pedro Almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and Jonathan Demme was originally attached to direct), Asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star Natasha Richardson.  Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession.  The basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist's wife (an excellent Natasha Richardson) and one of the asylum's patients (an equally good Marton Csokas), under the watchful eye of the patient's doctor (Ian McKellen).  There are several plot twists in the last part of the movie, some of which seem quite preposterous, at least in the way the movie was shot.    The only reason to watch this movie is to see Natasha Richardson.  She does her best in spite of the choppy script, and she even won a Best Actress award in London for this film.  However, as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession, director David Mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job.  (In fact, I remember that in the promotional interviews Richardson, credited as an executive producer, sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out. 
 Perhaps the worst tribute DVD I have ever seen. Jump cut editing will give you ADD (we're talking literally two-second sound bytes!), the grabs are pointless with very few comedians talking about Pryor getting more than one sentence in before they jump to the next trendy talking head. None of them say anything funny or enlightening either, which is surprising for something that is supposed to be a comedy/tribute DVD.  A handful of Pryor clips from an existing concert (just one) and two short clips from the Richard Pryor show. The sycophantic background laughter at EVERYTHING their interviewees say (and I mean EVERYTHING, it's pathetic) is really grating.  And there's too many terrible comics on here - Margaret Cho, Cedric the Entertainer, George Wallace, Jamie Foxx and a bunch of sub-Martin Lawrence jarheads.  Spend your money on one of his live concert DVDs.  This is rubbish made by people who think they have a sense of humour.  It's a beer coaster. 
 I had high hopes for this book since it is set in Mississippi and since I was under the impression that it had to do a bit with music from my generation.  However, if I had wanted a book exclusively designed around music, who wrote it, who recorded it, when they did it (both), what category it arguably falls in, and what arguments for and against each and every song from each and every album, and so on, ad nauseum, I would have just bought a book on music history covering the late 60's and early 70's. I know there must be a story somewhere in the 350+ pages, but I don't have the patience to skip the endless blather about songs and singers in between mentions of the plot that reading the whole thing would require.  I wouldn't bother with anything else written by this author 
 IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted 
 What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .   What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again!  If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER.  Did I mention no Denise Richards? 
 If you want to learn more about the Great Depression (as I did) don't buy this book. This book is not about the Great Depression, it is only about some Economics theory. And ONLY about that theory. It is a absolute dry read. I would not recommend this book 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 A quick note to counterbalance all of the glowing reviews.  Of course, everybody has an opinion, and one can't argue with taste as they say, so let me provide - for your consideration - a representative passage from the first few pages of this translation.  From the second page of "St. John's Eve": "I remember like now - the old woman, my late mother, was still alive - how on a long winter's evening, when there was a biting frost outside that walled us up solidly behind the narrow window of our cottage, she used to sit by the comb, pulling the long thread out with her hand, rocking the cradle with her foot, and humming a song that I can hear as if it was (sic) now."  I don't speak Russian, and maybe this "I remember like now" expression represents a literal translation of some Russian idiom, but it would have made a lot more sense to translate the phrase into something along the lines of "I remember as if it were yesterday" - a corny expression, but one that at least makes sense in English.  If this seems like a petty criticism, take into account that that kind of awkward, bizarre phrasing is repeated in just about every other sentence.  The translators are fond of corny, archaic words like "mug" (for face) and "drubbing" that seem like they belong in a British translation from the 30s, not something copyrighted in 1998.  I just wanted to give a warning to anyone who was actually expecting this to be a "modern" translation, i.e., a translation into something resembling contemporary English.  For the record, "Dead Souls" is one of my favorite novels and "Ivan Ivanovich / Ivan Nikiforovich" one of my favorite short stories, so this isn't about disliking Gogol 
 Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic 
 I bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning. I had to order another inner tube. Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller, the front wheel completely bent. What a piece of garbage. I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb. The other thing I didn't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag. I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller 
 Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment.  It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story. Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment. She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married. Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?  She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.  I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.  It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info. 
 We received two sets of these for wedding gifts. Two years later and we have one glass left. They break just when you're washing the dishes. If you want dishes that last, choose something else. Not recommended. 
 This wasn't the book that it was made up to be. You could get more information by watching PB 
 I thought this would be great for the size. The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic.  It provides no padding at all. The case itself is padded.  Why didn't they use the padding on the changing "pad" instead of the case? Very uncomfortable for baby. (It is basically like laying out a piece of paper.)I'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags 
    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
 I feel guilty giving Josh Lewin's book a rating of only two stars, but I should have looked more carefully before I bought the book.  I am a big Josh Lewin fan, and was disappointed when he left telecasting the Tigers with Kirk Gibson to join the Texas Rangers.  I grabbed the book as soon as I saw his name as the author, and I thought I was going to read about Josh's baseball experiences and the making of trades during baseball's winter meetings.  Instead, the book is about minor league teams auditioning audio tapes of prospective announcers looking for a minor league job at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville.  Some information is also provided regarding team mascots.  Had I looked at the book's contents before I bought it, I would have put it back on the shelf.  My rating of two stars is based on my interest level, not on the book's quality.  If you write another one on your baseball experiences, Josh, I will be sure to buy it, because I enjoy your work 
 I've over all enjoyed Brubakers Captain America, but have never found his writing to be as amazing as a lot of reviewers.  It seems very workable in most cases, but not very memorable.   This started out good, but the problem that comes along is that the villians' motivations and actions don't play out very realisticly, his insertion into X-men lore seems too arbitrary, many scenes designed to build suspense wind up seeming completely disconnected from the plot, and the Xmen's actions and reactions to civil authorities and civil catastrophes left me disgusted with them -- which didn't seem to be the intent.  Oh, and the major sin of Charles Xavier that sets the whole story in motion really doesn't make much sense at all on many different levels.  In the story, Xavier sends Vulcan and an new team of Xmen to rescue his old team of Xmen (including Cyclops) who are trapped on an island.  Vulcan is Cyclops brother, but he doesn't know it until right before the start of his mission. Vulcan and his team manage to rescue Cyclops, who then leaves the island to get help.  When Cyclops gets back to Xavier, Xavier tells Cyclops that Vulcan is his brother.  Xavier then apparently recruits a third team of Xmen to rescue both previous teams -- the original Xmen team and Vulcans team.  The first team is rescued, the second team ends up dead, and Cyclops can't live with the knowledge his brother got killed trying to rescue him.  Of course the only three people who knew Vulcan was Cyclops brother are Vulcan, Xavier, and Cyclops -- and Vulcan is dead.  So intead of just changing Cyclops recent memory and making him forget Vulcan was his brother, Xavier changes the memory of everyone who ever encounted Vulcan or his team, making each of them forget that the team ever existed.  Excuse me, what?  So then, of course, Vulcan turns out to be alive.  Strangely, he wakes up and instantly knows EXACTLY what Xavier has done.  Excuse me again, but how?  He's been dead since before it was done, and he wakes up in space already with a plan on how to get revenge?  And another question -- revenge for what, exactly?  Does he think Xavier got him killed?  Because that's never said.  The only thing that he seems to be angry about is that Xavier made people forget he existed (which again, is a plot device that doesn't make much sense the way it was carried out.) But if the only thing he's angry about is that Xavier made people forget about him, why does he come to Earth instantly trying to kill the people he once worshipped (the Xmen)? And what does that have to do with all the flashbacks people keep having about their troubled pasts (ie Nightcrawler remembering being hunted as a demon, Havok remembering Lorna cheating on him, etc.)    And when when Vulcan blows up an entire jetliner (killing hundreds of innocent people)to stop Banshee from bringing information about what Xavier did to the rest of the Xmen, the Xmen repeatedly brush off any responsibilty they might have in the accident, and even act like the only death that matters is Banshees'. Not only that, but Vulcan blows up the plane using the Xmen's blackbird, and when the government comes to find out what's going on and how the Xmen are involved, the Xmen act like uncooperative, petulant children, completely unable to see how or why the government would want to ask them questions.  It was THEIR freaking plane, and they think the government has no right to ask them questions about it!  I mean, the Xmen's plane crashes into a jetliner, killing hundreds of people, and when the government wants to know what's going on, the Xmen (instead of answering or cooperating) throw fits and get angry, and they act so self righteous and disgusting about it that I pretty much stopped rooting for them right there.   Of course, then that brings up the question; if Vulcan is so angry because Xavier made people forget about him -- again, Vulcan's motivations are not well established, nor are his plans, nor is how he even knows what Xavier did -- but, anyway, if he's so angry that Xavier made people forget about him, then why does he blow up the plane when Banshee has figured out what Xavier did and is bringing evidence to prove it to the other Xmen? Vulcan wants the Xmen to know.  Banshee has evidence to show them.  Why blow up Banshee and the evidence?  Oh, I know, because then in order to get evidence later, Vulcan has to open his mind to Xavier and Rachel, which is what allows the Xmen to beat him in the end.  Sorry, but that's weak plotting.  Overall, it was a moderately alright read, but it felt like it built to an anti-climax, and it certainly had several problems.  The insertion of the second rescue team into continuity seemed forced, and how the third team succeeded where both the first and second teams failed isn't gone into -- other than to say the way it's shown in Giant Sized Xmen isn't accurate -- that's just how Xavier made people remember it, but not how it really happened.  Vulcan's motivations were unclear, and how he even knew the things he knew was never explained.  Xavier's actions in the first place made no sense -- he could have simply changed Cyclops memory of the one and only time he'd been told Vulcan was his brother rather than change dozens of peoples memories about months and months of their lives -- but then this whole story wouldn't have happened.  And Vulcan's actions to stop Banshee which then lead to his downfall later seem to go against his best wishes even when he takes them, and therefore it seems like his actions exist more to serve the writer than himself.  The interior art is passable, but not as good as the cover, and definitely not art that in and of itself would entice me to buy the book.  Some of the characters are barely recongnizable from their apearances in other books (other than their costumes) and none of the art in the book really made me take notice. 
 The only good thing about this movie is the plot.  From there it goes downhill.  The script needs to be rewritten to add some sophistication to it.  The acting is marginal except for the actor that plays Justin.  If the script were rewritten then I think the acting would be better, maybe 
 I ORDERED THIS CD THE PACKAGEING AND CD SAID TAVARES LIVE. THE CD WAS AN OLD COUNTRY ARTIST. I WAS SENT ANOTHER COPY THE SAME SAD MUSIC,THE SAME PACKAGING AND SAME SAD MUSIC. I PAID TWICE TO RETURN 2 CD'S  I WOULDN'T KEEP FOR FREE IF OFFERED. BECAREFUL WHEN U OPENA BOX U THINK U WANTED. YOU MAY WANT TO RETURN IT RIGHT AWAY. I WOULD LABEL THIS NO STARS IF I COULD 
 There is a reason 1984 and Animal Farm are the famous ones this book is dull. It is the story of a man who first recounts his life before the war and then decides to take some sick leave and visit his old home. Most of the book seems to be devoted to fishing. It is sufficiently cynical but sometimes a plot is nice. Orwell should never use the Hemingway's style. Its not him. I looked all through the book and couldn't find a plot 
 My advice is to watch this in French, which is less painful especially if you don't speak French.  In English, its unbearable.  Slow?  At one point the DVD froze and I didn't realize it for several minutes 
 While I enjoyed certain aspects of this book, I found many of Angier's ideas to be completely outrageous and unsupported. A great example is her view on the evolution of women's breasts the reasoning she gives for their swelled permanence in human females.   She explains that women's breasts are pretty, flamboyant, irresistible sensory exploiters which fundamentally evolved by accident without considering and/or critiquing the issue from a social /political standpoint. She also presumes that the aesthetic breast is nonfunctional to the point of being counter functional, which is why (she feels) it strikes us as so beautiful.   She then goes on to compare the situation to that of Zebra finches in suggesting there is a neurophysiologic process in the female zebra finch's brain that serves some other, unknown purpose but that is easily co-opted and aroused by males white toques. The hat stimulates an extant neural pathway, and it lures the female, who knows only what she likes but not why This application of this theory to that of human beings lacks any substantial support since, unlike the Zebra finch, there is an absence of proof that men are born with a neurophysiologic process in their brain that causes arousal at the sight of breasts. I suppose it can't possibly have anything to do with social conditioning and centuries of pervasive man made images of the sexualized breast.  Remember pavlov's dogs who salivating at the sound of the bell? WEll, we tend to forget that human beings are animals as well. (definitely not suggesting that men are dogs by any  means ;0)) but simply replace the meat with hooker boots and breasts and you might be on to something. It also might be a good idea to realize that this phenomenon of breasts as aesthetically beautiful is about as ridiculous as our view of Chinese men who once lusted over women's feet once they were transformed by chinese foot binding, into stumps/sometimes known as lotus flowers.  The beautiful breast is not a universal ideal. These types of unsupported ideas such as Angier's can be extremely harmful to women and men since they contribute to biological determinist notions of sexuality, gender, etc 
 Sufficient movie to waist a couple hours downtime here in Afghanistan. That's it though 
 This phone has a very static reception and you can not hear your caller very well 
 mr. woods kept going down the hill but still so actively churning out bad almost barely readable novels year after year. this hollywood detective/cop turning bad story really sucks big time. very bad dialogue and storyline. guess woods simply couldn't get away from hollywood too far.now i rank him under sidney sheldon and harold robbins. give it a rest of this kind of hollywood junk, don't waste too much paper again. 
 The author writes with a dissonant combination of pomposity and indiscriminate praise, like an overconfident, star-struck teenager.  In lieu of the investigative, eye-opening look at resturants his book's title implies, Shaw offers self-promotion and uncritical opinion, which he presents as fact in regular, two- to five-page lectures worthy only of a soapbox on a deserted street.  Turning the Tables is 200 pages of pure agony.  Avoid it at all costs 
 As someone who has conducted psychiatric assessments in California's supermax, Level IV (of IV) prisons, of inmates with mental health disorders preparing to parole, I was seriously underwhelmed by this minimilistic, even meager portrayal of "life" on the inside. If you want "real life," go to http://oig.ca.gov/ and download the report of the murder of Corrections Officer Manuel Gonzalez (right-hand column). Now that is "life" in the big house. Games, maipulations, yeah, yeah. Bruton is wise enough not to disclose the reality. For that, read R.D. Hare's "Without Conscience," and you'll wished you had skipped Bruton. 
 This is the worst waste of money I have ever had. the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups. 3x magnification??? more like 9x !!!  you have to have your face right on the mirror or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors. My suggestion would be not to waste your money on it. its a joke 
 Man! this movie is soooooo boring. I literally slept through this movie. If I die not having watched it again ill be happy.   i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs. old, but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr 
 back and forth and back and forth.  im happy.  im sad.  happy.  sad.  love him.  dont love him.  love him.  dont blah. blah blah.  we're poor.  we're not poor.  we're poor.   a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.  malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).    spoiler    he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok!  (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no.  when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok.  the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad.  in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)     
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 Wish I would have paid attention to this one, the the previous review.  The cost for what you get is OUTRAGEOUS.  Only reason I gave it one star is because there was no place to give is ZERO starts.  Don't waste your money like I did!!!  FIND A MORE ECONOMICAL PRODUCT (plenty more choices on Amazon BTW) 
 I found the story to be somewhat  flat.  I finally gave up  and put the book down permanently around Chapter 7.  That said, I found the reviews to be over-rated both on here and elsewhere.  Much like some of the other reviewers, I found the author repetious to a fault in her attempts at making Christopher the pig sound intelligent, cute, and cuddly. I think her inclination in doing so was a detriment to the story overall.  Besides---maybe it's me, but after reading a portion of this pig's antics, and from viewing a smattering of photos, I seriously doubt I would use adjectives such as "cute", and "cuddly" ever in describing him.  Some might argue that I missed something in not holding out and reading through 'til the end.  But my gut told me that by Chapter 7, things were pretty much as good as they were going to get, and I was wasting my time plodding along in hopes that things might actually improve.  I'm sure this pig did indeed bring alot of love and joy in both the owners, as well as other's lives.  However the book's retelling of Christopher and how deeply he influenced so many  others left alot to be desired, at least for this reader.  
 Wild at Heart can captivate your interest and suck you in to believing it's all good.Problem with this book is that it is not sound when it comes to true untwisted scripture.I first loved this book and it began to change me until I researched further only to discover that The Bible has been used incorrectly.If you don't believe me,just punch in Wild at Heart on any search engine and read the complications with these writings.If you are a believer you will see in a very short time what I mean. If you're not a believer I suggest you purchase a Bible instead.With much love to all.......................... 
 I know that when I post this review I will be immediately slaughtered by all the Mahavishnu-heads out there, but hear me out.  Taken by itself, this is an album of excellent musicianship, interesting compositions, and incredible energy.  But I can't take it by itself, because I came to this album after hearing the one that came before it, "The Innermounting Flame," a fantastic album.  If one were to compare the two albums, the band is probably tighter on this one and the compositions may be more fully realized.  But there's a reason for that; to me, "Birds of Fire" sounds far too similar to its predecessor.  It's not that the style is the same--that would be fine--it's that the TUNES sound the same as before.  Almost every tune has an ancestor on "The Innermounting flame."  The title track of this album is in the same EXACT vein as "Gathering of Spirits" on the previous album.  "Hope" uses the same technique and motion of "The Dance of Maya."  "Thousand Island Park," the ballad, is the same kind of ballad as "A Lotus on Irish Streams."  The list goes on.  Either Mclaughlin wanted to build on the success of these prior albums (and this one sold a LOT of copies) or he just couldn't write outside of these several constrained methods (I really hesitate to call them gimmicks because I really do like this music).  The result is that "Birds of Fire" sounds, dare I say it, rehashed in comparison.  Add that to a feeling of overproduction that robs the music of its raw power from the first album, and you have an album that pales by comparison to its predecessor.  I really wish I could separate the two albums but I can't because the tunes are just so similar.  Maybe if you bought this one first and worked your way back 
  I was  hoping for rick atkinson GOES TO WAR.  What the book is is RICK ATKINSON goes to war.  Me, me, me. I, I, I.    Terrible writing and shallow thinking: tedious faux-erudite sophomoric metaphor, no real insight.  Snide leftie hate speech: "Although most officers in the military are conservative, General Petraeus' opinions were nuanced."   
 I have never read a manga comic book, so my viewpoint is clearly that of a newcomer to this genre. From this perspective, my summary message for "Buddha" is just what the title says: bizarre, and disturbing. While writing this review, I seriously debated reading the successive volumes and only then writing a consolidated viewpoint, but finally came to the conclusion that it made more sense to write one independently, for there are bound to be many others like me who pick this book up as the first manga of their life. So I would urge only such readers to go through the rest of this review: for experienced manga readers, there are many other reviews which will be of greater help.  In terms of the storyline, this book lays an interesting foundation for the birth of Siddhartha, telling many smaller stories of interesting philosophical import along the way. The story would have felt very incomplete of course if one did not know that there were 7 volumes succeeding this one, but with that knowledge, it is easy to accept this book as a one section in a larger canvas. The book creates some fascinating characters like the cocky and intractable Tatta, whose wrongdoings seem to easily forgivable in light of the purity of his heart, and his peculiar ability to become one with almost any animal. Other well fleshed out characters include a monk, a slave, and a general, and it is to the author's credit that he manages to portray the essence of each of these classes while still giving them strong individual personalities.   Where the book shocked me completely was its artwork, which is almost in a comic book tradition, with some people looking like the stereotype extra-terrestrials, and the experience of various emotions portrayed through extreme movements like characters flipping and jumping up and down. I found it extremely difficult to reconcile the overall seriousness of the book and the topic with these ludicrous movements. Taking this insensibility further were ideas like the cameo appearance by the author in the form of a doctor, and out-of-place comparisons by a merchant in a town in 3500 BC to modern-day New York or Paris.   The other key negative aspect of the book was some of the ideation and parts of the characterizations. I am not a prude by a long shot, and more importantly, I am an agnostic, so I can accept religious blasphemy very easily if it has a purpose. Even then, there was something very deprecatory and disturbing about some of the ideas and character portrayals in this book. As I said before, it might be due to my limited exposure to manga, but I don't think that should be an excuse. The first graphic novels I read in my life were great experiences, not frustrating ones. The first travelogues I read were fun, the first autobiographies were insightful, and so on and so forth.   In conclusion, I find it difficult to recommend this book at this point. I am going to read at least another volume of Buddha and give this genre a couple of more shots. Till then, I'll let you exercise your discretion on whether or not you want to try this series. 
 Superheroes are adolescent power fantasies. They should not be taken seriously by anyone over the age of 10. After that, they should only be read for laughs and kitsch value. This book is just silly. Comic book superheroes cannot and should not be compared to real mythology that has lasted untold generations and has literary merit 
 I simply spent time watchnig this French response to a Chaplin-style but non-silent motion picture.  Maybe, it was a top at the timing of the making. 
 Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader 
 We are too close to the events to provide sound historical judgement. I believe that in 50 to 100 years historians will aquit George Bush well. It will be far less kind to the John Kerry's, the Ted Kennedys and the Bob Woodwards. What kind of debacle wound we have had with Al Gore in the White House on September 12, 2001? It is said that there are thousands of followers of Islam flocking to Iraq for the chance at matrydom. Would Bob Woodward rather have them flocking here? Would you? Remember, they came to the World Trade center twice; both times the results were ugly and repugnant to America and world community. So soon we forget those and other attacks on American interests. The attacks are now on our troops who are trained and prepared to strike back. It is indeed a great misfortune that we have to have troops in Iraq or in harm's way any were. They represent us well there just as the American military has done all over the globe.  Woodward uses statistics which undoubtedly accurate. But statistics are just that - statistics. Are they statistically significant? What do they really mean? Are they short-term or long-term?  One reviewer speaks of George Bush single-handedly getting us into the mess, make that war, in Iraq. I remember Congress, including John Kerry, Ted Kennedy and John Edwards, supporting the war. Too many of us have lost our resolve; but understand that the Islamic radicals still have their resolve to defeat the infidels, America, England and Israel are at the top of their list. If they succeed in those countries, look for the likes of Spain, Australia and Canada to be next. Then they will take on the likes of France, Germany and Russia. Next, China. Mr. Woodward should understand that he and other liberals who have lost their stomach for a long difficult engagement because it is being played out a few bodies at a time that they are helping fuel to radical Islam in their thinking that we are weak. Woodward and other members of the press should cover the mindsets, propaganda and teachings of Radical Islam so that the electorate has a better idea of what we really face in Iraq and beyond. Where do we want the war to be fought?  Woodward should remember that is easy to sit safety out of the preceived range of responsibility and criticize. Where were he and his wisdom on September 10th, 2001? He should remember that as some wise observer once said, "No one ever built a monument to a critic." I will not be getting one either.    Where in the book are details of the Woodward plan for the war? How do we know it is better than the Administrations plan? Or worse for that matter 
 I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; "Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular 
 The first two songs are amazing, the rest of the cd lags. I cant think of what else to write hah 
 While living in Rio I once asked my Marine Corps buddy Paul Y- why he thought Brazil never could get ahead.  He pondered for a moment then said: "Brazil is the only country that respects sociologists."  I didn't fully appreciate what he meant until I saw Bus 174, a film loaded with the blatherings of sociologists and social workers explaining the root causes of why a glue-sniffing, cocaine-snorting, fugitive thief named Sandro shot and killed an innocent girl on a Rio bus in a botched holdup.  Then I understood.  When you've got a Constitution that says no one under 18 can be held criminally liable for anything (Article 228), you come to realize that you're in the grips of a sociological experiment gone horribly, horribly awry, that you're living in a nightmare of supremely stupid paternalistic sixties' utopianism, in a society with prescriptions for social problems wholly unconnected to reality or actual human behavior.  Watch this film and you'll see this ethos in its full twisted glory, from a bogus examination of root causes, to dimestore Freudian psychology, to neo-Marxist analysis.  Ironically, it's that last analysis that really has any traction.  Poor kids got to eat too, and if they steal to get food, it's at least understandable (c.f. Prov. 6:30).  When you steal to buy cocaine, however, then my compassion ends, as does the compassion of most people who are grounded in reality and common sense.  In short, look for a lot of handwringing about why a young man would go nuts and kill a hostage, interspersed with victim, relative and police testimonials that are interesting and sometimes informative.  The incompetence of the police in the situation is staggering.  They must have had 50 chances for a perfect head shot and never took it.  What a disgrace for all concerned.  As for the fact that the cops who suffocated Sandro beat the rap, well that's why jury nullification was invented.  Since we're on this same general subject, may I share a true confession with you?  First, some background.  I was an observer to the precursor to the Candelaria Massacre.  Because I didn't have a car at the time, twice a week I walked from Ilha das Cobras through Praca Pio X (where the Candelaria Church is located) to get to the...well, to get to a building located on Av. Presidente Roosevelt.  On July 23, 1993, I happened to be walking through Pio X in the afternoon and saw the commotion as the cops rounded up a bunch of kids while others taunted the cops and threw rocks at the patty wagon.  That of course was the genesis of the cops' determination for payback later that night.  My confession: before the massacre walking through Pio X scared the hell out of me because of all the street kids, one of whom I once saw stealing an old man's watch off his wrist.  Walking through Pio X after the massacre, I never feared for my safety again.  Infer from my confession what you will. 
 While Lonely Planet Cuba does a good job of discussing the country and its culture in an objective way, its discussion of hotels and entertainment is way off. Prices for hotels listed is correct, but reviews of the property and the surrounding area is terrible. In addition, the discussion of nightlife is ridiculously off - Cuba has very little nightlife!! 
 Unfortunately, I don't like this film.  The story is so sad.  Its about a greek peasant Alexis Zorba from the island of Crete, and his british business partner. The two man start business enterprises with coal mining and timber. But the enterprises are not successful.  They build an overhead cable line for transporting wood timbers.  And the line collapses, scaring everybody from the village. The two men have love affairs which end disasterously as well. The british man loves a widow, so her former boyfriend drowns himself in the sea.  Then the villagers slash the throat of the widow, as a revenge. Zorba has another love affair with a french dancer women. He promises to marry her, but she gets sick and dies in his hands. The poor greek peasants rob everything from her house.  I wish I had never seen this movie, honestly. The story is so unfair and tragic. The british guy and Zorba try to cheer up themselves by dancing and having some exciting "madness" in their lives. But it didn't cheer me. Worse yet, the movie is black-and-white and  the scenery shows old-fasioned, ugly village houses. I give it an extra star for the good performance of the actors and  the nice greek music, which is played occasionally. 
 Evola proposes that modern man's spiritual alienation is a result of civilization's abandonment of 'tradition,' IE heirarchy, sexual specialization, and distribution of power by classification based on primitive, non-scientific folk taxonomy. In fact, like Spencer and Huxley, Evola was a frustrated conservative who tried to explain his personal disgust with post-Enlightenment thought, liberalism and egalitarianism in an intellectual, logical light. His defense of the righteousness of privilege and social stratification fails, as intellectual history continues to prove. You might as well listen to Rush Limbaugh for a more coherent critique of the modern world and it's popular social 'values. 
 Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies.  Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way.  The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action.  Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?).  This is going to go down as the "Star Wars Prequel" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love. 
 I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was "Grind With Me" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.  I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond "Baby Blue", and Slick -- and I use the term "rapper" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single "Grind With Me" is really called "Grind On Me", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but "Playhouse" isn't far behind. And "Nothing But a Number" is very, very statutory.  Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like "If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right" on "Grind On Me", or "If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'" on "Grill `Em" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like "FROM THE BACK!" on "Get a Little Closer", and "Yes, sir!" on "Your Body". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on "Shorty Be Mine" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.  Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on "Never Let You Go", "Can't Live Without You", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs "Chevy" and "Grill `Em". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of "Your Body", dammit, I'll beat it up.  Anthony Ruper 
 After "Hush Money," I stopped reading the Spenser novels. The characters were stale, the writing was the same, and the mysteries were not much fun.  Well, the same thing can be said for "Cold Service." However, what was striking is that NOTHING happened. At least, not on the written pages. All the interesting action happened off-screen (so to speak).  The opening scene (Hawk in the hospital) and the closing scene (Hawks walks out of the abandoned mall) seem critical to the story, but we're not privy to the action. That may due to the fact that it's really about Hawk and since he's not the series main character, we can only "see" what happens through Spenser. OK, fine. I can live with that. Nonetheless, from the beginning of the story to the end, they do a LOT of talking and there's very little action. My other problem with the book: In 2002 (when I think the story takes place), I find it hard to believe that Spenser and Hawk can bring down a town without consequences to themselves or their loved ones. I had a serious problem with suspending disbelief to swallow that one considering what was at stake (drug money) and the stake-holders. On top of that, "The Gray Man" character returns and he, convienently and in a short period of time, becomes an inside man for Spenser and Hawk. Not believable. The plot had so many laugh-out-loud moments and unreal scenarios that I was wondering if this was a set up for the end of the series.  I know a lot people don't like Susan, but if you take her character away, there isn't much to Spenser. Susan is needed to add dimension to Spenser (though, she could be reduced in prominence). What I disliked is that Parker felt we needed her to "explain" Hawk and Spenser.  If you've read any of the previous novels, you knew who they were and what they're about.  I could be wrong, but I think the series has run out of steam. Much like most series, there's really no where to go. And as much I enjoyed the earlier Spenser novels, I'm not sure he (i.e., Spenser) has that much more to say 
 I thought I was buying a recently written book, and was very disappointed to see this is a 1985 book I had read years ago, with a new cover and a new introduction. For this reason, I have given it only one star.  That being said, the 1985 book was a fascinating travelogue for its era. Simon Winchester visited all of the remaining territories of Great Britain, many of them obscure places such as Tristan da Cunha in the Atlantic and Boddam in the Indian Ocean, populated by people who have been more-or-less forgotten by the British government. The best chapter is on the Falklands, where the author arrived a few days before the Argentine invasion. The author's description of pre-invasion Falklands was particularly evocative, as he describes a society stuck in a 1950s time-warp where the work ethic had been lost.  Winchester makes a number of cogent points about the governance of these places. He points out that the people in France's territories directly elect members to the French legislature, yet the people of Britain's territories have no representation whatsoever, even though they are generally staunch monarchists. Also, the author emphasizes how unfair it is that people in predominantly white territories have the right to move to Britain, but those in non-white territories such as St. Helena are not permitted to move to Britain. (Apparently some reforms have occurred since the book was written in 1985.)  It would be fascinating if Simon Winchester retraced his 1985 itinerary and described how these places have changed in the last 20 years. That is the book that should have been written 
 The application of the Golden Rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good.  John Maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule, its worldwide acceptance, and how we can apply it to our everyday.  It was more like a walk down memory lane; to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us.  However I do have a few concerns with Mr. Maxwell's book.  First there might need to be a better job at researching Fletcher thoughts on Relativism...in his book he labels Fletcher as the father of mordern day Realativism...quoting (or rather misquoting) Fletcher's statement that love can justify anything.  I am in not postition to defend Fletcher, for I am not that familiar with his work, however he does not just use the term love.  Rather he uses the term Agape Love, coming from the ancient Greek...the highest and purest form of love...one that God would have for us, a term any minister or pastor of the Christian Faith would know very well.  Second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track.  This links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track, as it turns into an advertisement for Mr. Maxwell's corporation, the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of Buy...buy...buy our products.  Not what I expected and was somewhat disappointed.  In short taking some know concepts, putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored.  Part of the disappointment is that I know this book could be better 
 Many reviewers seem to rate Monsieur Ibrahim highly because of Omar Sharif's smiling presence. This has caused them to overlook, however, the film's canyon-sized plot holes and overarching sentimentality.  I agree that the film has its good points: the scenery (Parisian street scenes and apartments, the Turkish countryside), the music and, to a lesser degree, Sharif's performance (when it avoids ladling on the syrup). And certain individual scenes work well.  Now for the questions: Who is the father, and why is he such a miserable human being? Why did the mother leave? More important, why does she briefly come back? Is there a brother, or not? Is there a Holocaust angle? If not, why? Or why keep it completely oblique? From what planet were the beautiful, sweet, happy prostitutes imported? Does the boy have no peers to rely on (or be corrupted by)? Should a lonely old shopkeeper be thought of as the best and only source of wisdom for a 16-year-old boy? Even if that wisdom doesn't rise above the level of what Forrest Gump would say? If this is supposed to be the early 1960s, why did the word "Algeria" not come up in conversation?  For some, these questions will be irrelevant, however, given the chance to see an aging Omar Sharif on the screen. For others, beware 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 I bought a collection of these older Golden Books stories thinking they would be sweet and "old-fashioned" but I have to admit they are all a little odd.  Most were written in a time when things weren't totally geared towards kids as they are today.  The book is very wordy and the pictures are fairly sparse.  The story is a good one, but is buried in a lot of detail.  Not great for a 2-year-old.  Maybe older kids would like it better.  This one ends oddly with Dumbo securing a good salary and a pension for his mother.  Actually, maybe that is a good lesson for kids now that I think about it 
 Okay, I'm going to go against the grain here and say that Suttree really isn't all that good.  Maybe it's fine literature -- although personally I don't think so; I think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of, absorbed into with a pathos for its characters, good or bad.  Here we get only snatches of that.  *At times* we feel akin to Suttree.  For example the prison segment is good; there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book; but on the whole Suttree is a rambling and confusing mess.  Why struggle so much with a book?  It's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex -- sure, at times it's sublime -- but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline.  The reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes.  The relationship between Suttree and Harrogate is great, but there needs to be more of it -- I feel like saying "yeah, yeah, yeah, just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of Suttree's mysterious past."  If you want to read this, you have been warned.  You will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time.  Page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting?  If you think it's worth it "in the name of literature", then that's up to you.    Note: I have read Blood Meridian and thought it was an excellent book: definitely go read that one first.  And I read A Child of God, which was also great.  I was hoping to become more of a Cormac McCarthy fan reading this one, but I think I've gotten to the point where I'd rather read the back of my shampoo bottle or peruse my way through a stack of disclaimer forms.  McCarthy is a master of the language, no doubt.  But in order to make us read the book he ought to at least make it interesting 
 This entirely absurd treatise on the "nobility of old wealth" is the most ludicrous piece ever written by a fully deluded and perverse individual.  He attempts to convince us that "Old Money" is somehow tied in with the betterment and refinement of culture, of artistic values and family mores and a sense of "community values".  I scoff at the very idea that the "wealthy" are any more perceptive or beneficial than those he calls the "rabble" at the bottom rung, their sole difference is that they are insular, arrogant, unsound and can effectively manipulate the corrupt system in place in the social world.  They live in a world of delusion, segregated from the perception of the common man and of their own finality.     Entirely avoiding any attachment with reality or historical manifestations, the author rambles on, endorsing us with his vision of the world as a "better place with wealth".  He avoids the mitigation of corruption, political scheming, murderous exploitation of workers, and unethical urgency in the characteristics of the wealthy.  Don't waste your time with this unless you want to laugh, pick up Karl Marx again, its a more enriching read.  Long live the proletarian 
 If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one 
 If you are interested in reincarnation books make sure you have read "Northumberland Dreaming" before you try this 
 For starters, one witnesses what appears to be a large clump of 2x4's floating out in space, followed by a series of apparent environmental stock-footage with likewise accompanying music.   Krull is an action-adventure fantasy circling around a pentagram-like weapon which is the only instrument that can battle "The Beast", who presides over an army of dark warriors called "Slayers", and a dematerializing black fortress which is never stationed in one place twice.  After his kingdom is overturned, a prince turned king by the death of his father sets out to find his kidnapped bride with the council of a wise man named "Ynyr", which sets him on a trek to find the spiked boomerang {a veritable 'shiroken'} and The Black Fortress. Along the way, he gathers a small army of common thieves, a fumbling "sorcerer", a decrepit 'seer' with his boy-servant, and a cyclopse.  For an action-adventure, this film contains much too much unecessary dialogue, extensive travelling scenes, and a lot of climbing. Since the battle in the first twenty-minutes or so, the film remains rather slow until the last half hour, wherein 'Prince Colwyn' {who looks like Barry Gibb} and shoddy troupe penetrate the fortress and do battle with The Beast, after predictably dispatching a large number of mis-aiming 'slayers'.   In the end, 'Princess Lyssa' is rescued from the clutches of the wonderfully demonic monster, and they re-commence with their previously interrupted wedding by exchanging vows as well as a flame derived from water.  The typical 'good' vs. 'evil' scenario exists here, most commonly displayed in the conclusion wherein in conjunction with the penta-blades, this 'flame of love' overcomes the 'blasts of hatred' emitted from the Beast monster.  This film seems to concentrate on more of a children's faerie-tale type of story, rather than a more mature version of the genre, and could very well have been animated. I suppose it may be more appreciated by Lord of The Rings / D&D -type of fans, yet with the exception of the impressive flying weapon and giant Beast creature, as far as fantasy-action-adventure, the film is unfortunately, a rather rudimentary presentation. This is one of those films that could have been better with such a great premise and villain, but disappointingly does not live up to its full potential 
 This  is one extremely ponderous book to read.  The author makes several well intentioned points, only to get bogged down in his own research and wordiness.  Read it if you must....be sure you have lots of time to decipher it once you have 
 I bought the book due to the reviews, even though I have seen this couple on tv and wondered about them. I found this book way too fantastical. Some of the stories were waaaay out there! I don't even think they investigated any of the cases. Not all of the stories dealt with ghost, some banshees,demons. Also very short book. I wondered if they just wrote down passed down stories 
 there is good tune you can dance over and over again "LET IT WHIP"  by the dazz band. the rest are  funky wild music not for elective taste 
 With all due respect to Dr. Ablow, I thought he was really over-reaching in his analysis of someone he never met.  The book was filled with repetitive analytic conjecture about almost every sentence Scott ever spoke. Sometimes a duck is just a duck.  Dr. Ablow repeatedly states how Scott "probably said ....", or "probably thought..." and Lacy "probably replied..." The book is filled with these fictional guesses as to the thoughts and feelings that MAY have occurred.  Scott's apparent sociopathic behavior was traced in part to the murder of his maternal grandfather more than 50 years before Scott was born.  It's obvious that, to a great extent, our personalities are the result of our parental upbringing, but to relate dates of negative events in the life of Jacqueline Peterson to dates of negative events in Scott's life is patently ridiculous. Overall, I felt that this was just one more opportunity to take advantage of this sensational case to sell a book.  Very disappointing.  
 This is the worst, most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.  There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while, their actions just become inexplicable.  The author's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.  It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman's darkness or one of his minions.  Additionally, the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands, nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.  What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.  Unlike some of Stephen King's work (ie: The Stand), there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.  It's evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.  All I can say is that this book is ugly, ugly, ugly.  At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness, but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.  The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for  him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.  I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence, I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author's work again.  It's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist, Dave McKean, who maybe hasn't completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has.  His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened-up the book--and maybe a little because the title intrigued me.  But it's unfortunate that the industry rewards "clever" works such as Mr. Gaiman's with undue praise.  I've never so strongly disliked a book.  Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book?  Well, don't believe the hype, this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X-men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you 
 I agree that Karate is an excellent way for children to learn self-control, discipline, and self-confidence. I've seen it in the children I teach Karate to, as well as in myself while learning it as an adult. However, this essay does not offer any new insight to anyone who has had any exposure to Karate.  In addition, the author begins with an introduction about how homosexuals are not "right" which has nothing to do with the topic at hand. Very strange 
 I had a 28S that survived my teenage years, high school, 7 years of uni, field work, dogs, kids, being dropped etc. it lasted almost 20 years - in contrast my 12C Platinum has been looked after and lives in a brief case - after 18 months the keys are so wonky it is no longer usable - HP cluelessly suggested buying a new one would be a solution - if this was the price of a casio, I'd get it, but only because I dig RPN!  This is not like the HP of old - google around.. 
 "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together.  If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated.  However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you.  By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop.  One never materialized.  This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.   As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion.  Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages.  
 i've been reading the reviews for this book, and I wanted to offer up my own opinion.  I first read this book as part of my high school 11th grade english cirriculum.  And as a warning to others, I just wanted to say that reading this book was like watching paint dry.  There is no structure, and after a while it seems like your just reading page after page but are retaining nothing.  Though there are some very interesting funny parts in the books, the overall dullness of it all overpowers the good.  At some points, I wanted to claw my eyes out in despair.   I admit, I do love Mark Tawin, but this is in Noo sense, his best work.   Ones again, this is just my opinion.  Read it and see for yourself 
 I had Vol. 3 be Jay-Z's worst. Even though it is a Jay Z album, there are a lot of guest appearances by Memphis Bleek, Talib Kweli, and Amil. Talib Kweli is the best of them and Bleek is an awful lyricist and Amil is a Foxy Brown ripoff.  Jay-Z puts some good material despite, like "I Just Wanna Love U".   Not a good album. Very commercialized. Don't buy it unless you are a huge Rocafella fan 
 I am the original King LaBrue out of the camp of Kool Herc and the Herculoids.  Before there was Sugar Hill and 50 Cent, there was King LaBrue--to this day still represents true hip-hop.  I plan to write my own account of the true pioneers that should be respected for dedication and commitment for all these years.  
 how many RPG's can this world make??  they're all the same.  open this container, take weapons and health kits from this dead body, use this spell.. KOTOR is no different, sadly.  the combat IMHO is just really boring.  when you see an enemy, the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make.  if that doesn't kill the enemy, your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves.  umm, how many times has this been done before?  if i wanted that, i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're on now.  all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers.  it's the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack (look it up).  the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it.  
 I bought this book looking for something that would tell me things I didn't know about Disney (I've been to WDW countless times and love everything Disney).  And while there were things I didn't know presented in the book, they weren't things that I found terribly interesting.  What you get on each page of this book is a brief statement of fact...like #48's "A former test car from Test Track can be seen in the ride's gift shop at the exit" or #89's "Africa is represented by the fictional village of Harambe."  After this you get a paragraph (i.e. not alot) on the statement.  For #89, you're told about the real village in Kenya that Harambe is based on.  There is then a 'furthermore' section which may/may not be related to the info on the page.  For example #89's furthermore section is on technology that can't be displayed and the authors talk about a 'makeshift insulator' which is really a Coca-Cola bottle.  This is supposed to be 'a nod to both the inventiveness of African towns and the longtime sponsorhip of Disney parks by the Coco-cola company.'  If that isn't a stretch I don't know what is.  As another reviewer said, there's little meat to this book and perhaps that's what didn't hold my interest.  The one paragraph of info really did not give alot of info and the furthermore sections were hit or miss about pertaining directly to what was on the page.  I read through the book once and put it away as I don't think it's a good reference 
 I'm so glad we didn't buy a subscription to National Geographic Kids magazine without checking it out at the news stand first! It truly seemed like there were more pages of ads than of actual CONTENT in this magazine.  If you're looking for a good kids' magazine about nature & wildlife, try one of the National Wildlife Federation's excellent publications. My kids enjoy Your Big Backyard (for ages 3-7) and Ranger Rick (for kids 7 & up), both of which are available through Amazon.com or [...]  Kids Discover magazine (for 6-12 year olds) is another favorite with my children (and me) and contains great science & social studies articles without the commercials of NG Kids. You can subscribe through Amazon or [... 
 My best friend advised me not to read this book. But, she's a bit of an elitist, so I figured, what the heck? I mean, I like plenty of things she finds annoying or stupid. I was wrong. Here is my honest impression of the book:  First chapter: This isn't so bad.. a bit melodramatic.. but not bad Quarter of the way through the book: He is not going there, is he? Third of the way through: OH GOD!!!! He went there!!! Halfway: Please, please stop this... oh no, he's borrowing from everything I hold dear! Three quarters: *Mouth open in disbelief* This is TERRIBLE!!! End of book: Why, why didn't I listen?   I recently saw the trailer and thought "Wow, that really reminds me of A New Hope.You know, the scene where Luke is looking off into the sunset.." It isn't the unoriginality that made me hate the book, or the bloody mess Young Sky - I mean, Paolini made of the archetypes in the book, it was the tone the author used. That smug, smug tone.   This fills me with sadness for all the good writers out there who don't have the rich, influential parents to push their work to the top of the stack 
 I thought that this book was very hard for me to understand. I find that it was just the authors thoughtsabout waht she had read. I found that if I could have gotten past the understanding of the book then I would have enjoyed it much better. I think that I did not like it because I felt as if I was rereading all that time what I had already read. It would be a good book for someone that is into statistics. But however it was very hard for me to comprehend 
 There are two versions of this book: the regular edition and the "Deluxe" edition. The primary difference is that the Deluxe has additional content on two CDs, one of which contains the self tests. The problem is, the test engine is (by the publisher's own admission) defective. I downloaded the "fixed" test engine from their site, which meant that I could have saved $20 by buying the regular edition and doing the same thing. Even worse, the answers in the "fixed" test engine frequently contradicted the book! With no way of knowing which was correct, I had to get a different study guide and start studying it from square one. Just get a different book like Exam Cram's so you don't spend twice as much time and money 
 This is just another book about the holocaust and hungarian jews, and not one of the good ones.The title and back cover has little to do with the book itself, The few American POWs stories are there only to justify the title of the book. It's a shame to use our soldiers in order to sell a book that otherwise would end up in the clearence section not long after printed 
 Of all the Anna Pigion books I have read, this is the worst. The charecters are shallow and stiff, the dialog stillted and meaningless, and the park is not well described and in no way seems like a place one would like to visit. This mystery seems to be a big "so what". Not nearly up to Ms Barr's best efforts 
 Well, I gave this CD its first spin after a two year absence of ANY Ricky Martin music in my life. After his 1999 self-title CD, I pretty much went head over heals for Ricky. When this CD came out in November of 2000 I was really excited. Upon first listening to it, I thought it was better than his 99 CD but no where near as good as Vuelve. It would take 2003's Almas Del Silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this CD leaves.   As several folks know, Ricky was under pressure from his managers, producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 CD. Sound Loaded is what we got. This album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it. Weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'Livin La Vida Loca' fever burning. Ricky's voice just sounds tired and worn out. It's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation.   There are a few standout tracks on the disc. 'Amor' by far out shines every song by a mile. Had Sound Loaded had more great tunes like 'Amor' on it, the CD would have been a hit. As it is, the CD is mediocre at best. 
 I read this book several years ago.  Just recently, I read Anthony Robbin's Unlimited Power.  If you're choosing between Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited Power, definitely go with Unlimited Power.  Don't bother with this book.   
 Both this book and the "Red" book mislead readers by listing "price values" that are blatently low,-on the very uncommon items listed, even though the pricing errors were brought to both author's attention years ago. Many revisions later, they remain for the most part unchanged. Shame on them 
 Although there are a few gems (Syd Dale's "The Penthouse Suite" being one of them) much of the music on this disc is pretty forgettable. It's the kind of stuff that cash-strapped TV producers in the 70s used when they needed to soundtrack hip party scenes without paying huge copyright fees. If you like kitschy yet high-quality lounge/easy melodies then you'd be much better served buying the two-disc "This is Easy" compilation from 2004. That set contains the good stuff from this album plus a whole host of memorable and evocative instrumental and vocal numbers to set your toes a tappin' and your heart a soarin' 
 If Shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play "Othello", he would remove Heaven and Earth crying out for justice. Be an actor in a play of Shakespeare it's difficult and only the best ones can do it, not mediocre actors with face of children. What's Martin Sheen doing here? He should be in better movies and in this trash, if you want a good "Othello" adaptation, get the movie with Kenneth Brannag and Laurence Fishburne, are good actors and a better movie 
 Charlotte.... oh God! what a change!!! that's pretty sad. I didn't liked this album, just one tune... the one of Even God.... but i hope youll gï¿½t back to sing like an angel 
 "Con Express" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it 
 A book well written but unfortunately highly biased justifying the russian atrocities. Certainly war is by itself an atrocity, but that do not allows an army to commit barbaric actions against women and children 
 I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots, but it didn't last long. Not even 3 weeks after I bought it, it already has deteriorated. Given that I live in Seattle, rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking. It was like wearing melted cardboard 
 book is just a brochure for advertising a franchise of financial advisers and broker 
 "Grub" opens by poking fun at people who get "cranky when the goat cheese isn't served at room temperature", or are "fond of restaurants that serve chocolate-covered edamame", and then goes on to gleefully serve up recipes such as "Yucca Chowder", a recipe which by itself calls for a dizzying list of exotic ingredients including yucca, "kombu", "recao", saffron, and okra.  What is the point of lecturing for half the book about using locally grown foods, and then offering recipes crawling with uncommon or downright bizarre ingredients?  Where the hell am I supposed to get locally produced plantains, black rice, and pine nuts in southern Michigan?  Should I buy my "kombu" organic?  Perhaps I should skip down to the farmer's market for the ingredients for their "Picadillo-Stuffed Chayote with Rutagaga-Garlic Sauce."  Failing that, I suppose I can always go collect some "seitan" (what the hell is it anyway?) from my vegetable garden.  It has been a long time since I read Diet for a Small Planet (written by the author's mother) but I seem to recall simple, nutritious recipes made from a minimal list of recognizable ingredients.  If the child of that heritage has grown to believe that this sort of nonsense is sensible, then the whole foods movement she claims to champion is indeed doomed to failure.   
 Far better use of your time and money is spent on acquiring and reading Xenophon himself. 
 I was disappointed in this one because I was expecting something as well-researched and based in history as the old Hornblower novels. Suffice to say this one ain't. It is riddled with historical inaccuracies. There was no war between the Moghuls and the kingdom of "Prester John" at that time. And there are so many little details which a modicum of research would have revealed, such as the (Urdu speaking) Moghul Maharaja speaking Arabic, or a description of what is obviously a hummingbird (which lives only in the Americas) -- small points but when I say this sort of thing was repeated ad nauseum you get the message.  Smith even borrows an incident from "Hornblower and the Atropos" in which someone is shot in the chest but the bullet travels around the rib to the back, where it lodges and causes fever and inflammation. Forster uses the incident for character development (the wound is the result of a duel between two cantankerous individuals; the wounded man is absolutely vital to Hornblower's mission and the other duelist is the doctor who has to save him while Hornblower is all but tearing his hair out). In Smith's hands, however, the wound is simply part of a battle and the extraction of the bullet the excuse for as much gore, pus, agony, etc., as he can lay on. Also, I HAVE to ask: is anyone out there familiar with fencing or swordfighting? I've done a little fencing, and the climactic fight in which Hal kills the evil Colonel Schreuder turns on a trick of swordfighting which simply doesn't make sense to me. It sounded odd when I read it, then I tried to visualize it, then it seemed like nonsense. I even got a couple sticks and tried it out with aanother friend of mine who's a better fencer than I. It just doesn't work. I gave it two stars because if you like gore, sex, and fantasy in a historical cloak, this is OK. 
 I sell my services as a scientific consultant and I have learned that prospective clients are interested in themselves, not in me. As I redirect my professional practice and revitalize my marketing/selling program, I have read many helpful books. All the professional services marketing books stress the importance of focusing on benefits. So does a very good cold call selling book I just read. Goldner's book, in contrast, never mentions benefits to the prospect, only features offered by the caller. His scripts have the same artificial structure that turns off my interest immediately when telemarketers call me. I know I'm not alone in this response. I am very disappointed in this book and it will not remain in my library 
 Completely useless to women in their 50s or over 45 --- the book appears to be written for college students and 20s+ whose relationships are primarily based on sex and who have a huge reservoir of available mates from which to choose. It's emphasis upon self-respect is fine.... but the author has no understanding of (nor does the address) the realities of the over 50. 
 I am a strong admirer of Alan Dershowitz.  I especially enjoyed his books The Genesis of Justice, and Reasonable Doubts (O.J. Simpson case).  Unlike those books, America on Trial tries to do way too much.  It is more like his Contrary to Popular Opinion book, where he presents many of his earlier published commentaries on the law.    Unfortunately, I found the writings in the current book to lack the cohesiveness and well considered analysis found in the earlier book.  Granted, this is not true for every case that he presents.  However, he includes far to many cases for which he simply wants to inject a personal opinion.  In so doing, he misses opportunities for more developed theories of particular cases.  Frankly, many of his comments on some of these cases could have been presented in a paragraph.    I understand that he is trying to explain various aspects of American law by using an assortment of cases.  But, his points become obscure and sometimes repetitive by having too many cases in a format that reminds me of Reader's Digest, or U.S.A. Today.    In sum, there is not enough in this book to be useful for serious students of law or history, and too many cases for the casual reader.  I hope that this is not a sign of the dummying down of Dershowtiz.  
 This is the first book I have ever returned to Amazon. I was looking for a book to tell me "How To". This book is more advertising than anything else 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 I thought this would be a good book until I read the paragraph telling kids not the set goals too high and keep expectations realistic.  I tossed it after that.  Shouldn't kids be settting high goals for themselves and working to achieve them?  Even if the goals seem unrealistic, should anyone really tell a kid his expectations are too high 
 a couple of good singles and alot of filler. you will try to sell this cd in two years  
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
      Don't get it wrong -- I like the ideas and spirit of Buddhism. It is a religion, and yet it is not insistent on belief. My own view of it is that what people do is much more important than anything they believe -- but will be shaped by what they believe, at least in part.       One of the things I like about a religion is when it emphasizes doing good. I like it even more when the religion does not call upon people to have faith in something; faith in the good outcome of good works and good attitudes is enough for me.      But I found myself struggling with one clear, inexorable truth: This set of DVD's was not well put together. Normally, a tape or writing of the Dalai Lama is most interesting to hear or read. But this seems to stem from some educational conference where what is being done is one of the most republican of all ventures, preaching to the believers. It is partly marred by the need for translation. That would be very appropriate at an educational seminar. Unless you are in the mood to go back to school again, I would recommend anything else taped or written by or about the Dalai Lama.      Recently, I have done little to suffer more than listen to and stop the world while hearing these two DVD's about the existence and cause and end of suffering. Yes, the intelligence and good spirit of the Dalai Lama is clear in the DVD's, but if the presentation is wrong, even a William Buckley would seem boring. In these days of cheap electronics, for instance, I would recommend hiring a videographer who has access to good lighting and audio control and is able to cut and paste a little.       In the context of these DVD's, Buddhism would almost seem to be as dogmatic about these Four Truths -- all related to suffering and it's cures -- as some others are about the Holy Trinity. As a somewhat non-religious admirer of Buddhism, I am able to stand back and say clearly, buy something else, anything, about, by, or regarding the philosophy or religion.       At the same time, I must state that I would be more nervous and clearly on the receiving end of more knee-jerk criticism for my critique where I disecting the views of some other famous religious figures, whose followers would be so likely to have "faith" that not only would the criticisms fly by deaf ears, but the shouts would be geared to drown out even so slight a criticism as to say that a set of tapes or discs is boring.      Trusting that I will not lose my head over this, it would seem to easy to be critical. To the contrary, it is a hard thing to do, as I am an admirer of most everything that I think the Dalai Lama stands for. I would only pray -- if you will -- that next time there's a seminar like this, they pay more attention to detail in the production.    
 The Kidz Bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. And don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. Kids also like to eat McDonalds, but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. There is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. And, surprisingly, a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children, even with the expletives deleted. There is no reason on earth why these records should exist, excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. I agree with the person who suggested the Beatles as an alternative. Seriously, don't buy this! 
 I hate to echo what a lot of other people have said, but bulk always adds veracity for me when it comes to Amazon.  Yes, the plot was intriguing--a kind of expansion on "Pale Fire." The twist was easy to see coming, but I'm not sure surprise was what the author was going for in the first place, so I'm willing to excuse it.   What bothered me was not so much that the characters were bad; they just weren't good. I've been persuaded to like many a very, very bad man before: Humbert Humbert, the Viscount de Valmont, Count Fosco, and yes, Charles Kinbote. In each case, the villain possessed some quality which made his villainy more understandable, or, barring that, at least more appealing. Usually it's cunning, adaptability, or cleverness. But what's Ralph Trillipush's redeeming quality? He's a megalomaniacal, pretentious multiple-murderer with nothing to be pretentious about. We never really get to know his opium addict fiancee. The Australian detective is a self-centered, blundering idiot. The two Oxfordian lushes who accidentally create this mess don't really become full-fledged characters until the last 30 pages. There was nothing for me to latch onto here except a pastel-colored pity for the whole lot of them, and that's just not enough to take me through an entire book, even if the plot is exactly the sort of thing I like.  I've read "Prague", and I'll continue to read the author's other books, too, but this one squandered so much of its potential that I'm going to acquire hardcover versions more cautiously in the future 
 I am only partway through my organic chemistry course, but already I know enough about this book to give it a very negative review. It simply does not explain topics well enough. Also, The problems at the end of the chapters are simply not difficult enough to prepare you adequately for exams. Although I've never used any other textbook, this one justs seems horrible. I'm generally an excellent student and can learn from many different types of texbooks, but this one is just horrible.  I referred to 'Organic Chemisty as a second language' by David R Klein for a clear understanding of many topics such as fisher projections, asid base strength, predicting substitution and elimination reactionns, resonance, drawing chair conformations, determining the configuration of a stereocenter, and many other basic concepts which are not explained well in this textbook.   If however, you are going to use this book, I would highly reccomend buying the solution manual, it is difficult to use this book without it. The solutions manual (4th edition) repeats each question before giving the answer, so it also a valuable aid to use even without the book itself. 
 This is another example of what happens when good articles are extended into poor booklength works.  The author's mother said the author's father forced her through a glass window once and yet the author blames her mother and all women with a backbone on fatherlessness in Black America.  Daniel Moynihan's 1965 report on the Black family has been attacked by African-American thinkers of both genders, yet Barras hardly sees a problem with it.  This book does nothing but blame women for being victims.  Like all conservative rants, it blames feminists, rather than sexism for the problems that women have.  This could have been an exciting, thoughtful book; instead, the author speaks in hyperbole and sees no problem with being ridiculously one-sided.  Further, she's a journalist, not an academic or an author.  Thus, not only should the book be seen as amateur, but it's written in an allegorical style that I found silly.  This book should not be embraced by the African-American community.  As a pro-feminist brotha, I can't understand why a sista would created this misogynistic tool to harm Black single mothers and womanists throughout the nation 
 I purchased this DVD a while ago - FYI - A documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie.  I went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found.  Here, years later, when I'm finally placing another through Amazon They found my account and noted that I purchased Meet John Doe.  I guess it's a little late to complain now 
 I bought this album based on the media hype preceding its release. It was described by one critic as Led Zeppelin with estrogen or something to that effect. Not being familiar with Sleater-Kinney's previous efforts, I came to this CD with fresh ears and fairly high expectations...which were shattered when I listened to it the first time. Some albums take a while to grow on me so I listened to it a few more times before deciding unequivocally that I hated it. Although "The Woods" is overly recorded, poorly sang and terribly unfocused, I do admit that I like "The Fox". After that I go into a post-punk-induced coma. Refund please 
 Some pages are missed and some pages are the sam 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 Sorry to say, I did judge this book by its cover, which is very attractive and eyecatching. After looking over several Narnia Guides, that was my determining factor in choosing this title.  But, ohmigosh! As another reviewer had mentioned redundancy, I'll try to find another word - and that would be tedious. Fully, LOTR is mentioned... well I stopped counting at 40 times, and that's not including the utterances of each of the trilogy's subtitles. I wasn't at all interested in comparison, and had I not already read the Tolkien series, and seen the movies, it would have been way-off base.  Think: "African elephants are like Indian elephants, they have different ears, which makes them alike, since they both have ears, but they are different, seeing one is not enough evidence to state one has actually seen an elephant which is strongly endorsed to be one or the other".  Sorry for the bad example, but it really reads like this. The last perhaps third of the book is dedicated to the collectibles and comments from WETA Wookshop, responsible for making the pictured items. Oddly enough, the items range in price from $150 to $300, and this is in a book written for children. Not including the back matter, the "guide" really stops on page 110 or so, but the next 70 pages contains theaspects of recorded versions, movie critique and the aforementioned trinkets for sale.   This, and the enthusiastic approach to the Disney version, and charms and jewelry only add to the commercial overtones of the book. I'm sorry, I wanted more content, less trivia and chit-chat.  There was a bright spot, however, and that is the great list of other resources, including websites and reading materials. I do wish he had gone into a bit more detail of how so many of the C. S. Lewis papers and the Wardrobe ended up in of all places, Wheaton, Illinois - so far from the Kilns, and England itself.  Truthfully, the disclaimer about the book not being prepared, endorsed or authorized by C. S. Lewis Pte Ltd, or any associated entity should have been the tip-off that perhaps there are others more suited to what I was looking for.  I bought this for a gift. Sadly, after reading through it myself on Christmas Day, I was disappointed. If, as the author says in his own review, that future editions will address some of the problems, what good is that to those who have already bought it 
 i can't believe that they got money to make this "movie"(i use that term loosly). the plot has more holes than you can count and the worst excuse for a reason to start a killing spree that i have ever seen. not even worth the price of a rental. just long and slow. you have been warned 
 This book is a classic example of why PBS should have its taxpayer life support plug pulled when they employ a leftist to give us his "unbiased" view of the world on "News Hour."  His fellow leftist and plagiarist, Goodwin, I guess is the "balance" for his views.  This book is so much nonsense that I don't know where to start in pointing out its complete abandonment from any semblance of journalistic honesty.  But if you are a Kool-Aid leftist, you will love this book. If you have more than a fifth-grade education, you will wonder why you wasted your two dollars to buy it. 
 I bought this book after seeing Gary Null speaking on a PBS TV program. I was so impressed with his knowledge and the hope he offered in the anti-aging remedies he discussed and other valuable information he was offering in this book. I just couldn't wait to read it.  Unfortunately, after I purchased this book, I was very disappointed.  My strongest impression about the book was the very disorganized way it was prepared. There is a serious lack of appropriate catagorization and sequential arrangement of subject matter, topics, etc. It was hard for me to believe that Gary Null had anything to do with the preparation of the book.  I thought he had just mistakenly designated an unprofessional, inexperienced person to take on that responsibility for him.  After approximately 3 years, I'm still trying to understand his anti-aging program/s and the approach of implementing them. Its hard to make sense of a bunch of information randomly thrown together. Since then I have found  valuable books with practicle approaches for emplementing the anti-aging programs in them.  I recommend The Perricone Prescription, and The Wrinkle Cure by Nicholas Perricone M.D..  He has recently published additional anti-aging books, as well 
 These were not what I expected at all.  The rollers were small and the comfort clips didn't even stay on the roller once I wrapped my hair around it. I used the rollers once (that was enough wasting my time) and they did not even curl my hair.  My hair had not volume or body.  These rollers not good for long hair. I returned this item and wish I had never ordered them.  
 This is not a review of Ms. Yates's writing.  Instead, I am awarding the single star to the physical book perpetrated by the University of Chicago Press in 1991.  The good news is that this edition doesn't cost very much.  The bad news is that the 1991 edition is a bad reproduction of an earlier edition.  The ink bleeds all over some of the pages.  There are diagonal streaks on many pages.  Sometimes the ink is light grey on one side of a diagonal streak, while it is dark and smudged on the other side.  Parts of letters that landed in the streak are missing.  A note on the back of the title page claims only that "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the ... Standard ... for Library Materials."  Does this less than ringing endorsement mean that the paper is acidic and will soon deteriorate?  If so, it won't be much of a loss 
 This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow 
 uninspired and down right boring. I feel I wasted over an hour of my life listening to this disc.. 
 Dr. Gray must be a wonderful lover.  As a woman I read his hints and suggestions for a man's love making technique and marvel at his insight.  I truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom.   However there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover.  By maintaining a position of gallant "ladies first" mentality he, in truth, is demeaning the power of women's sexuality.  There is much to be gained by men reading this book.  Attitudes can improve, skill levels can rise and even the articulation of loving feelings can be created and/or grow with the help of this book's suggestions. Women are unfortunately reduced to being receipients of, not participants in, in bedroom activity 
 Strange to say, I did not like this novel nearly as much as her earlier work.  I usually find her narrative voice and her attention to detail charming and engaging, but here it bogged down and just became tedious.  There are no fully-drawn characters, only types, including the heroine (or should I say "hairoyne" -- from a motif in the novel) herself.  And, while I found the dilemmas of her earlier characters regarding marriage and identity quite moving, especially in "Another Marvelous Thing" and "Family Happiness," I found Geraldine's crises to border on the selfish and self-absorbed.  Who knows what might have followed this swan song?  For all of that, I do love Colwin, and I still cook from her cookbooks 
 all her other books are interesting, but not this one. lowdnes.com is a sales pitch site. no valuable info there other than ordering new copies of her books. 
 I saw Dead Ringers in the movies. The theater was filled with mostly couples. When it was over, as we walked out, laughter began to spread as we all recognized that we as couples were having the same conversation; "Whose stupid idea was it to pay money to see this move"! 
 Chingy, one of the few people in the world that can't change his facial expression. His music is ridiculously bad, his beats are annoying, and his face alone is enough to make me want to kick his teeth in.  Do yourself a favor, and flush this turd down, along with all your fiddy cent and D4L CDs 
 Way too much attention to "social history" and "cultural commentary" and not enough information on Mae West.  It was if the author felt she had to use every bit of historical background she had found - little of which served to move the book forward.  I did not feel I got to know Mae West nearly as well as I did the times she was living in - which was not what I wanted from a Mae West biography 
 While the cover boasts that this book is the Age of Uninnocence, conjuring up the idea that it is comparable to Edith Wharton's novel of manners, the book doesn't deliver.  It's a door mat on the floor of Edith Wharton's penthouse.  There's no real plot to this novel and the characters are one-dimentional and vacuous.  Edith Wharton, like her friend, Henry James, had a great ability to write scenes with witty dialogue, revealing character in subtle ways.  Wharton used symbolism and multi-layered textuality in a way that Bushnell seems incapable or at least does not attempt.  And if we are comparing Bushnell to a jouranlist writer like Hemingway or Tom Wolf, there again, she doesn't measure up.  There's not multidimension to these characters, to the text.  There's no interesting subplot within an over-arching story.  It's all subplot and no major premise.    It might be shocking to midwesterners, but it's not much more than that.  Once you've heard about one oral sex encounter, the other ten are simply boring.  The three-some sex chapter is an overkill and I left the chapter feeling a bit smarmy.  If that's what Busnell wants us to feel, pity and sorrow for her characters misadventures, then she succeeds.  I don't get that impression, however.  I honestly don't know how anyone can "enjoy" the book. It's not funny.  David Sadaris is funny. He can make you laugh at people you feel sorry for -- that's a talent.  I felt sad for the characters in Bushnell's book, none of whom I actually cared about.  I wanted to shake them and tell them that life isn't a series of three-somes, rails to snort, and cigarettes to smoke. I wanted to tell them to get a life.  Move to Nambia and work for the UN.    The only redeeming chapter was the Bicycle Boys, which was perhaps the best written chapter. It has some interesting and novel observations.    On the whole, women lack direction and look for men to rescue them.  There is no real self-reliance here.  Even the women who are financially independent, like Sam, are so needy that it defies imagination.  The stay-at-homes in suburbia are supposed to repel, but their desperate housewife syndrome is more attractive than the empty sex and drifting that Carrie and company must go through.  In the classic sense, the women in Bushnell's novel are as trapped as the women in Edith Wharton's novels, but they are not as interesting.  In the end, they all want to bag a man who will take care of them and settle for whomever they can get. This isn't about women's friendship or about relationships at all. It's about survival of the fittest. In the year 2006, it's really a very sad book and if this is life in Manhattan, I'm really glad that I decided not to live there.  I'd take my life a million times over.  
 When I read a fiction story, I don't want to be lectured about the author's hidden agendas. Another reader reviewed this book as complicated. My review is that this book is unimaginative and preachy. I was expecting to read a forensic mystery novel, but I found so little forensic detail that I quickly became bored. The characters were flimsy and the dialog was sometimes, for lack of a better word, silly. I was also unimpressed with the opinions of the main characters in this book. They seemed to share a common thread of condoning homosexuality/lesbianism, abortion and divorce, and not a kind word was said about "the church". As a religious person I took a huge offense to this. I believe every person should do what's right for them and leave everyone else alone, without passing judgement on other people. Maybe I am one of the few who believe this. In any case I would not have mentioned it  but I think there may be some religous people out there who do not believe works of fiction are the handiwork of the devil, and might want to know about the opinions in this book. If you are religious you will not enjoy it. I read the Da Vinci Code and wasn't offended at all- corruption is everywhere and I am sure "the church" is not free from it. But I don't appreciate all Christians being portrayed as judgemental and mean people. I tried to keep reading despite being offended, hoping that if I pressed on I would be rewarded with an exciting story. I read more than just a few chapters and decided to call it quits. I was not impressed with what I did read (maybe I'm just a CSI junkie) but I just couldn't take it anymore. Had I known all of this was in the book I would not have purchased it. (I left it in the trash.) lf you are Christian and decide to buy this book anyway...you were warned. If you are not Christian or easily offended (even if you are difficult to offend), this book was too simple, the dialog too trite, and the characters unbelieveable- in a bad way. If you like good mysteries or forensic mystery novels, steer clear of this one and try your luck with another one 
 The saw does not come with a case and you have to use a allen wrench to change the blades.  For a little more money you could get a saw with a case and quick release to change the blades 
 ALREADY KNOWN EXERCISES,NOTHING NEW.... ANYWAY A GOOD CONFIRMATION. VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND 
 The truth is this is a Book for PENNYPINCHERS, presented in a more "respectable" fashion with a shiny cover and bullet-headings (it should be called "PENNYPICHERS GUIDE for the ModernDay). Now theres nothing wrong with saving bucks where you can and being abit of a PennyPincher when you want to work towards financial independence or some other higher goal in life... but this book wants you to live like a Tramp!   This book will NOT teach you how to make money, it will not show motivate yourself to perform better in life, it will not help you become a Millionare... or become financially independent.   instead the advice it offers is at the other end of the spectrum, it tells you how to live like a Tramp, basically how to "get away from the city" and move to a farm on the outskirts. How to survive in a Cave or on top of a mountain (where you dont have to pay a mortgage!), it details how to grow your vegitables (3 non-stop pages dedicated to gardening), how to buy your clothes from BootSales, how to basically "DOWNGRADE" and "SLOWDOWN" your life to be One with mothernature.   now some of the advice is good, like spending more time with your family, giving children limited pocket money to teach them value of it etc. but i was disapointed in this book because there is hardly  no advice on how to become successful and be rich.   So if you want to sell your city apartment and live in a cave, growing your own food, sewing your own clothes, and running around with wild horses... then by all means go ahead and buy this book.   If you (like me) thought that this book will teach you about Money, how to earn more, how to spend it WISELY (big difference between being MoneyWise and downright STINGY!) and how to one day become financially independent...then sadly you will be disapointed so think about giving it a miss.   advice: checkyour local bookshop and see if you can pickup this book for cheap, for a book that preaches frugality and pennypinching it came at a farily high price to my wallet! and just flick through and read a few pages before you buy - 
 It's killing me! Recipies are not complicated enough, wines are not difficult enough to get a hold of, figuring out american measurement system and calculating it into metric is not bad enough? Oh yes, let's make it HARDER and let's not include any photos.  Jesus and Blessed Virgin Mary! I need pictures in my cookbooks. What the meal is supposed to look like in the end for sure. A "how to" strip - even better! I'm gonna be too intimidated by my absolute lack of culinary experience / finesse and lack of pictures in this cookbook to even TRY to use it! Other than that (is there anything left? oh yeah) book is beautifully designed, paper quality is excellent but format is kinda weird (square and rather large) so it sticks out the cookbook shelf. 
 I bought this book hopeing to get into shape for my wedding, I find it dificult to follow. Yes she does map out a plan but you have to filp back and forth and practilly memorize the book before you go to the gym to get the moves down! 
 Christmas morning, my daughter tears the paper off this toy and is soooo exited. What a disapointment. Nothing I did caused the tail to wag, the leg to move and no licking action. I changed the batteries, still nothing. After hours of trying to get it to work, I went on line here and read somebody elses review about rubbing under the collar VERY HARD. Finally, the tail wagged, the foot moved and then, it actually licked. What a piece of work, very cute but WAY too much work. In time, I will eventually rub all the fur off under the collar. Save your money 
 I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.  I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.  Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up.  Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley.  I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse 
 I can't believe that people are comparing Novembers Doom to Opeth. To put them both in the same sentence is heresy in its most profane, I feel bad even putting both their names in this same sentence.  First of all, Opeth are far more talented and craft epics that shatter and defy what we know of modern music, not to mention their contribution to the re-defining of Death Metal/Melodic/Doom. Novembers Doom are average at best, there is NO stellar musicianship or amazing epic songs on this album, or any other Novembers Doom albums I have heard.  The Pale Haunt Departure has its moments, though far and few between. Every song is marred with the horrid singing and cheesy Doom talking of the singer. Seriously, his singing SUCKS! His screams are decent though, and you can hear his lyrics(which suck and repeat about the same concepts through the whole album ie..not being good enough, is there a tomorrow, blah blah blah), but he sounds like a cheap immitation of the Amon Amarth vocalist.  I will admit some of their guitar riffs are pretty good, but they repeat the same parts over and over, as if they could not conjure up decent change ups and variations, and besides a few gems mostly sounds boring. The drummer sometimes sounds like he just started drumming, he uses his snare drum way too much and doesn't seem to know how to use it. There are a few decent drum parts, but nothing spectacular. There is virtually no bass at all, heard once in a while, when you can hear it, its average. But overall, the song structure and dynamics are horrible and poorly put together. I don't see why everyone praises these guys. Maybe I just don't get the whole Doom Metal genre and its fans, but this album is weak weak weak. I agree with the reviewer who stated that the intros are the best parts of the album, but after you get past 30 seconds of each song, the song turns into garbage. People are so willing to give out 5 stars to every album. The Pale Haunt Departure is not worth 5 stars at all, more like 2.  The Pale Haunt Departure makes me realize that anyone can make an album and get signed to a label 
 Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely 
 Granted, Erikson's book makes for a great read, but lacks any real credibility. This book, along with his book on Gandhi, demonstrate that one can read anything into people when seperated by time and space. Take  everything you read with a grain of salt. There are many more Luther bios  that are more accurate and useful 
 Before you buy this book cut/paste the following words into a Google search:  "Hank Hanegraaff" financial  Then come back to this review.  It makes me weap to see Christian ministries misuse God's money. My advice?  If you really MUST read this book, buy it USED so the money goes to a struggling book seller.  
 Snore.  I too have loved and read the others in this series.  This one bored me to death.  I agree with most of the negative comments here.  I was happy that Harry and Fair got married again, but with the emotional tension between the two of them gone, something is missing.  I missed Maranda, too, who only appeared briefly at the end. I loved her bible-quoting moments and the descriptions of her yummy baked goods.  I think it was a mistake to have Harry leave the post office.  Gone are the wonderful cameo appearances from minor characters throughout the book. With the shocking knowedge that Mrs. Murphy has not been spayed, are we going to see little Murphies running about?    Well, every good writer -- and Rita Mae Brown is indeed a good writer -- is entitled to one bad book now and then.  Hope this is the last bad one in this series 
 "Moby Dick" has been hyped far beyond its worth because it was the first American novel with philosophic pretentions. You could read the first ninety pages, then skip to the last ten and miss nothing but a binful of symbols. It's gauche, jejune, primitive, a graphic novel without illustrations--one of the few American novels improved as a Classics comic book. Joseph Conrad covers the same material better, and Persig better than either of them. This is a wearying tome that no one would read if it weren't assigned reading. It will teach you . . . nothing 
 There are very few serious articles in this magazine-- just tons of tidbits (stats/facts/tips). By the time you get to the end it's difficult to recall anything from the magazine; it's that shallow.  Occasionally there's a good recipe, but that's about it 
 I'm afraid this book is pretty useless as far as factual information goes. Few texts are properly cited and  John Paul I is quoted as saying all sorts of things--ie condemning Moses--which it's pretty hard to credit. Many of his public speeches are available and they don't support the contentions made. Both David Yallop's and John Cornwell's books cover the same material and are vastly better; though they write from very different perspectives 
 Artisan has released a horrible recording of a very good, sophisticated comedy that questions the values of marriage.  The DVD I got from the start had poor sound quality, faded color and was actually out of focus.  To add to this this disc started skipping, freezing and even getting the vocals out of sequence with the picture.  Don't waste your money on this release.  Wait for a better release 
 your money could be well spent on something other than this, not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal-mart 
 You can read Slaughterhouse Five in a few hours. Nobody needs the Cliffs Notes to this book. Everyone knows Cliffs notes are not used for notes, so all you lazy students, just read the actual book. It's worth your time. Cliffs Notes don't deserve any stars, and in this case, don't waste your money. The book is incredibly simple, and short. Don't make it meaningless 
 Read the dust jacket and learn the four key principles: trade with the trend, cut losses short, let profits run, and manage risk. You don't need to spend the $28 to buy the book 
 I was extremely disappointed in this book.  I bought it used online and regret wasting my money.  This book does not resemble the MCAT at all, and there are blocks of questions which are virtually identical to one another, except for some of the numbers being changed.  I also noticed a bunch of errors which was another frustration.  I am now using my textbook, College Physics for practice questions 
 The late Dr. Kelly is one of my all time favorite authors in the field of Church History (_Dictionary of Popes_, _Golden Mouth_, _Jerome_), but this foray into Biblical Studies, is quite disappointing.  Dr. Kelly merely retreads tired interpretations of what are three of the most overlooked but most interesting of the New Testament epistles.  The inclusion of 1 Peter with 2 Peter & Jude is highly dubious as well.  For really interesting writing on Jude & 2 Peter, I would suggest E. Earle Ellis' or Richard Bauckham's work.  There are many excellent commentaries on 1 Peter, too many to list.  I guess even brilliant authors have their off days 
 I have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile. I took TrimSpa 32 and I think that it did better than this product. I have been taking it for a week, and along with that, I have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch, plus working out. Dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week.  I've noticed NO change.  I am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out.  I'm very hungry before lunch and when I get home I have to take a nap and can't work out until later in the evening. I really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level, which is really unfortunate 
 Yes, I love Microsoft Office. It's incredibly user friendly, it has wonderful features, most of which I don't even know how to use, and it's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it's kind. I've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy Microsoft for my personal use, the school would always buy one for me. And of course there are always illegitimate means... but I'm not advocating piracy here.  However, I would be the last person on earth to consider using Microsoft Office if I had to pay $350 for it. It's an insane price. consider the alternatives:  Open Office: Does everything MS Office does, some things even better. I love how you don't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in Open Office. The best thing about this, however, is that it's FREE!  Google Docs and Spreadsheets: This one is even better. Not only is it free like everything else from Google, you can COLLABORATE IN REAL TIME with  anybody else on the internet to write your word documents! Nothing beats that, it's just the most wonderful thing that Google has done 
 Macbeth V.v 25-30: "A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."   Stream-of-conscieness technique (no punctuation), southern accents (no spell check), mixed and matched timecrawls (flashbacks without warning), sequencing narrators (voice change with no scene break), first and third person viewpoints (confused yet?), and slapped-your-faceee! symbolism.  For literature, I choose Hemingway (who can be subtle or direct, but is always clear).  Good books should be enjoyable and understandable.  I understand the story Faulkner was trying to tell about a Jerry-Springeresque southern family, but I didn't like the novel.  If you want to enjoy dsyfunctional American families with blistering social commentary watch 'South Park'-- much funnier.  I'll let one of Faulkner's contemporaries speak:  "Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use." --Ernest Hemingway  Unless you are forced into this book for a literature class, don't buy it and don't read it.  If you look hard enough, anything can become meaninful, even this tripe.  Victor Hugo, Shakespeare, and those ancient greeks are excellent in that their works have themes and meanings already.  You don't have to overanalyze and create meaning where none exists in order to enjoy those works.    Faulkner is babble and murky and opaque with circular symbolism fading into tempestous violence only an idiot pretending genius or an eleemosynary prententious genius enjoying idiocy might love and obtuse run-on sentences longer than this one are exactly what you'll find all over this classical work 
 In the House on the Edge of the Park, a group of decadent rich kids invite two blue collar low lifes (David Hess and Giovanni Lombardo Radice) to a party (which, presumably, is being held at a house on the edge of a park).  At first, Hess and Radice are rather cruelly patronized by their hosts.  However, it turns out that Hess is also a psychotic sadist and he quickly turns the tables, spending the rest of the night tormenting and raping the upper class.  Finally, his victims attempt to strike back and it all leads to a "surprise" ending which is surprising mostly because it seems to have been made up at the last minute when the film's makers realized they didn't have an ending.  Though hardly the crime against humanity that some critics have made it out to be, The House on the Edge of the Park is still a pretty lousy movie.  After a strong start (the film has one of the most disturbing openings I've ever seen), director Ruggero Deodato appears to grow bored with the material and shows little of the flair that has distinguished his other films.  As well, the film does feature one of the worst (if undeniably catchy) disco soundtracks ever to show up in film.  As the film's violence escalates, it starts to display an attitude that comes dangerously close to being blatantly anti-female (a claim that, all hyperbole aside, cannot really be made about most Italian exploitation films no matter how over-the-top their action may be).  If there is a redeeming factor to the House on the Edge of the Park, it is the lead performance of David Hess.  Playing a truly depraved character, Hess is actually quite frightening and never less than believable (even when the rest of the film isn't).  In this film, Hess creates one of the most memorable screen villians ever and he brings a real element of danger to the film.  As his mentally challenged buddy, Giovanni Lombardo Radice also gives a good performance, creating a character who is both sympathetic and scary.  Indeed, Hess and Radice give performances that are probably too good for the film they've found themselves stuck in.  Though it's hard to recommend the film to anyone, it's very easy to recommend these two excellent performances to anyone who appreciates good acting. 
 Please note that I'm doing a review for the whole series up to now.  The start of Megatokyo was fairly shaky and almost like a rip off of Penny Arcade but with a mixed in running story. It was funny and it was irrelevant. What truly impressed me with Megatokyo was how both creators Fred (the artist) and Rodney (the co writer) worlds/writing would blend together to form a very distinct parody/comedy/story telling style.   I love how contrast of the 2 main characters Piro (the serious and hopeless lover manga archetype) and Largo (the delusional gamer) are able to mix their worlds together so well. My favorite moments in the manga is when Piro talks seriously about his problems with relationships while in the background Largo levels Tokyo with a giant radioactive lizard.  Unfortunately, with the departure of Rodney, most of the magic is gone and the manga has turned into a story driven angst filled anime soap with only few interesting moments in between. The plot keeps going over and over again and it is mentally draining listening to all the angst spewed repeatedly by the main character Piro.   Another sad thing I have noticed in this series, for a NOW story focused comic, pacing is not only slow but there is virtually no character development. The characters stay static and when there are hints they will be use to make the story interesting, Fred drops the ball by using stale old anime story clichés.   I understand that Megatokyo tries to parody anime and manga, and I have no objection to that but how he uses this parodies as a story telling element is poorly done pretty obvious to where he copies most of his ideas (A.I. loves you, love hina etc).  I'm guessing that many of its fans are relative newbies to manga and anime so most of the elements Megatokyo copies from anime and manga are, to them, fresh, new and/or interesting - so I can't really blame them. Of course there is also that otaku fan boy fantasy of going to Tokyo and doing what the main characters have done. It seems Fred has found the jackpot by targeting the right demographic just like what how producers of boy bands target teenyboppers.  Maybe my standards are just a little too high for a webcomic like megatokyo but considering how great its fans make it out to be, you'd think it would be fantastic as sliced apple pie. If you are a veteran of manga and anime, I cannot recommend this series to you but if you are one of those new wide eye anime fans then Megatokyo might appeal to your sense of wonderment about whole new world of Japanese comics and japanimation 
 It boils down to quitting your addiction, cold. And it's hard, really really hard. Personnaly speaking, I'm addicted to alcohol and cigarrettes. Lucky me, it's the "usual" ones. Without reading this book, yeah I'm being totally honest, just on the face of it, this book is BOGUS. If you're anywhere near a library, (thank you Carnegie!) check this guy out, for free. You'll "get it" real fast 
 The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning.  The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief.  Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking.  The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.    Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror.  But The Taking provides no such return 
 We actually had 2 of these. The first one-- the plastic pot cracked after 2 weeks, and we got a replacement as an exchange. The replacement worked great for 14 months, and it died suddenly. We've been taking good care of it, boiling water 2-3 times per day for tea, noodles, etc... The water boiled really fast while it worked 
 If you have a lot of extra money to spend on plastic, pre-made, self-watering containers, then this is definately the book for you!    There is ZERO information in here on making your own self-watering containers, save for the advice of using a "ready-made insert".  Personally, I don't have the energy to extrapolate the info herein, and then, McGuyver-like, invent my own self-watering containers.  And I certainly have better thing to do with my money than buy plastic pots designed for stay-at-home suburban-organic moms with too much money.  If you don't have money to burn, instead get:   "Moveable Harvests" by Crandall and Crandall.  Their soil mix recipes haven't failed me yet.  I disagree with their preference for hybrid vegetable varieties, but nobody's perfect.  "Bountiful Container" by McGee and Stuckey (if you can overlook the cutsey post-menopausal twitterings [waa-ay too much info on edible flowers], there is a ton of info in there)--  Or, if you're a Gen-X urban gardener- "You Grow Girl" by Gayla Trail.  Gayla ROCKS 
 After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco (still in great shape after 4 years) into the basment and ordered this Pink one.  After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!)  My daughter is 12 months old & 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap.  There is a 3inch gap between her & the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap.  The thick padded seat is adorable & comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up.  The base is very large & her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well.  The buckles are awkward & impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you 
 I wish that I had more carefully considered all these other opinions that suggest this book is not that good...because now I agree. On my best day I am barely an intermediate web designer and this book had not ONE secret to offer me. The Studio Secrets book it is for beginners only - the HTML is the same as any other beginner book, and the scripting samples you can pull off of virtually any web page 
 You know, I used to like Renny Harlin's films when I was younger, but they really don't hold up, I've realized with my coming of age. I think he's a talented director capable of some genuinely biting action scenes ('Cliffhanger', 'Die Hard 2'), but overall his films are messy, and, if I'm to be scholarly in articulating the matter, stupid.   For me 'Deep Blue Sea' has a few things going for it. One -- the beautiful Saffron Burrows, who I might add can actually act, doing at least what she can with the generally bankrupt dialogue. Plus, there's a laughably contrived scene which requires her to get half-naked; given I didn't care about much by the time this gloriously sleazy moment appeared, I can't say I wasn't all for it. Then, there's the uncommonly merciless attitude of the film; none of the characters are given sympathy, and I find that admirable and devoid of manipulation. I mean, Sam Jackson's fate... Female leads being chomped to pieces. In a film comically unrealistic (which I don't judge too harshly, for it is made on the primary premise of SUPER INTELLIGENT SHARKS), the nature of the miserable situation is played out with a welcome, sensible set of results. Oh, and I'd say that LL Cool J is surely the peak of the film's performances; I hate the guy when he's in that ultra suave, dripping sweat, buldging, chocolate Casanova, but his role here is near the antithesis of that; a goofy, Bible quoting cook, with an obnoxious bird (I can't imagine who's brain this abominable idea came from) and a past alcohol problem.   And then there's Harlin, who, like I said, certainly has a knack for creating some of the most awesomely thrilling action scenes among Hollywood's finest directors of the genre. But, in 'Deep Blue Sea', sad to say, there are only a small handful. Also of some note is the score by Trevor Rabin, which covers moods from heroically cheesy to atmospheric and eerie. I think this is especially commendable for Rabin because, by and large, this is a horror/thriller (the former a bit of a stretch), requiring him to maintain a good deal more restraint than has ever been requested of the composer.  When it's all said and done though, it's just not very good. I can understand why people would enjoy it, because it is mindless and has some redeeming features spawning from that sense of recklessness -- and surely, I'm not against this particular mentality in a film -- but it's just a bit too stupid and apathetic for me to care. I got it used for a bargain, but I'm not sure it was really worth even that. And, while I'm by no means ashamed of its existence within my library, I'm pretty confident I'll never sit through the entire thing again 
 I can't give it any less than one star but what the heck, The girls were hot so there's the one star. Other than that I am literally dumber after watching this movie! I swear to god! I passed out after watching this film because I got so stupid I forgot to breathe! They should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job! Even if they just ran around the set yelling "1,2,3, Potato Salad, March!" The dialogue would have been 1000 times better. Message to the producer: Give it up loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.  
 Professor Yoo makes many seemingly compelling arguments in favor of his contention that the President has virtually unfettered authority sanctioned by our constitution, but, as reasonable as his arguments may seem, what I find to be the underlying flaw is that he's arguing that unrestrained authority of the chief executive is somehow consistent with the principles of constitutional democracy and the rule of law upon which our system of government is based.  Frankly, this is a completly cognitively dissonant position; advocating an authoritarian right in the name of democracy just doesn't  meet the test of reason. It's functionally identical to the argument that "We have to destroy the village to save it" made popular during the Vietnam War.  Benjamin Franklin famously said; "Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety". Clearly the good professor doesn't seem to grasp this essential concept as elucidated by one of our most respected and revered Founders.  
 This would have to be the worst book I have ever read.Wow Will is running from dead people. Some one is trying to kill him so cool.How much more boring can you get.I would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater. So what I'm saying is it stinks 
 Well, I just got this book. From the Preface: "This book is not a "how-to". This book is one level higher and deals with the cognitive psychological theory of designing and developing technical communication...". Thats not what I need. I looked for "how to' not for another academic book. Well this book is going to the return center 
 I was not pleased with this selection at all. Of the five books I purchased through Amazon.com involving the single parent, this was the only one I could not force myself to read. Instead of giving you insight and  advise on single parenting, the author used Bible verses that implied  single parents were inferior to two parent families. Too much negativity  for me!! 
 This is without a doubt one of the most poorly written books I have read in several years.     Tragedies such as Hurricane Camille involve so many unique individuals and communities that a writer should have no difficulty in capturing the interest and emotions of even the most casual reader.  This book includes the stories of many such individuals.  And yet, the presentation of these individuals is so lacking in cohesion that the reader becomes more consumed in trying to keep track of who is who than in the tragedy of their stories.     Part of the reason for this problem is the lack of depth provided by the author.  Most of the survivors written about, the reader learns, have their homes flooded, lose valuable possessions (that they will no longer care about), survive by hanging on to a tree or large object, pray, and find they have lost someone in their family.  True? Undoubtedly.  Interesting?  Not in the way that these people are portrayed. All of the stories are so similar that the reader quickly reaches the point that each reiteration brings a response of "Again? So what?"  And that may be the saddest part of this book; human tragedy is reduced to being boring.   What the author fails to achieve in personality and depth, he makes up for in clichés.  Concise and clear observations of events are rarely found...unless, of course, you want a history of every hurricane that has struck the Gulf Coast.  This history the author feels is so important that he dedicates two chapters to the recitations; one chapter to document the loss of life for each storm and a second to document the loss of property.   As a resident of the Gulf Coast, a book such as this should hold considerable interest for me.  Instead, it took me over two weeks to read the 195 small pages of narrative.  I forced myself to finish just so I could justify the money that I spent.  
 This product is difficult to sqeeze out of the bottle, need to use a lot of product to condition hair and just not happy with results. Hair seems stringy and has fly aways after use 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 Like so many others I found that the unit fails quickly. The original failed after 4 months. The replacement lasted only long enough to get beyond the warranty period 
 This book was horrible! There was no logical order to the book because it is just a bunch of stories put together about Duveen. It is so boring, all the book does is talk about how dumb millionares were and how they were stupid enough to buy from Duveen and his crazy ways. This book was so bad, please save yourself the time and money and not buy this book 
 It's a very strange thing when "extremely harsh criticism" is cited as evidence of value. Is it just possibly that this book was harshly criticized because it deserves to be, because it is a very sorry excuse for a work of musical--and, for that matter, sociological--scholarship? I think it IS possible. I think it is more than possible; I think it is quite likely. It is "readable" for non-musicians not in spite of its "scholarly content", but only in that it lacks "scholarly content"; it is not particularly well written. Obviously, it has its partisan proponents--the sort of people who don't like having to think subtly or deeply but who still want to be taken seriously, the sort of pseudo-intellectual people who want to have it both ways--, but this is no recommendation 
 If you're a big fan of the Frank Peretti novels such as "Piercing the Darkness", you might enjoy this story of evil, demons and semi-Biblical themes. As a Christian, I found the parallels to the Bible to be interesting, but not compelling. In fact, these parallels were the only thing that kept me reading. In creating this work of fiction, Meyers goes well beyond the biblical descriptions of events-and this is fine. The problem I found was that Meyer's writing style is a bit annoying. It seemed like everything was measured in yards-the truck was getting closer and closer, 20 yards, 17 yards, 13 yards, and so on. It just didn't ring true with me. Meyers is fond of telling us that tears "burn" the eyes of his characters. And there are elements of the plot that seem contrived to add to the story. Sarah, a research scientist at a parapsychology lab drives an old car with a bad carburator. A single woman with a high-paying job would fix it or replace the car; she wouldn't put her safety in jeopardy. But Sarah is "too into her work". Even after the bad guy attacks her and her car fails to start when she tries to run away, she still drives the thing. In fact, the very next day she's giving her boss a long ride out in the country in it-even though her boss has a fancy car back in the parking lot. Another nail in the coffin is that even though Sarah's attacker's identity is known nobody calls the police. This leaves him free to commit more crimes that add to the story. And it goes on.   I'm afraid that Christians desperate for this kind of literature will artificially inflate the popularity of this book. It's really not a high-quality work 
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 WHAT A LOUSY MOVIE! AND I READ NOTHING BUT GLOWING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS CONVOLUTED PIECE OF BAD ACTING, BAD STORIED MOVIE. PLEASSSEEE, SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A BAD MOVIE, BORING AND ALL-AND-ALL A LOUSY STORY. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT 
 If you order this item, it will spill because of the weak bottle cap. Without any outter package, the bottle cap will either break or loosen 
 Other current pop-rappers like Jibbs or Unk that have one or two hits usually have a consistent album behind them.  At least that's what I thought.  I can't say the same for Mims.  With his long-winded intro about music saving his life, you start to wonder if Mims is trying to appeal to your heart or your ear.  Pretty soon you find that it's not really either.  Many of the songs are too soft compared to the hit, lacking even big bass that makes for an enjoyable car ride.  Savior self, skip Mims 
 This book didn't give enough information, and it was very misleading.   Look for Dr. McDougall's books on Amazon. Or, if you google Dr. McDougall, you can go to his website and see what he has to say about diabetes. Numerous studies show about 75 percent of type 2 diabetes is completely curable - within 10 days - by changing your diet. Period. You can come off all medication and insulin. He gives the information you need, completely free, on his website. Use his method, and you'll soon see your blood sugars return to normal . . . but then the various companies that make a fortune off diabetes will be suffer.   Another thing about this dummies book: It's chock-full of ads. The author heavily peppers his writing with all sorts of product endorsements and gets kickbacks for them. 
 I've used the Palm OS going on 10 years now.  When my Treo 270 died, I bought a used 270 on Ebay.  Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon.    I called Palm "tech support" on issues I had with it (dial up networking didn't work on internal browser with T-Mobile).  Forgive me for saying it, but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be.  I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another (he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time- did he think I was lying to him?).   He knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor, constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time.  After a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650.  I then tried the T-Mobile MDA.  I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try.  For me it was a huge mistake-  Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive.  They expect you to study how to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface.  Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use, but c'mon- when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning- I don't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly.  Finally, I give up on Pocket PC (sold it on Ebay) and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out.  The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 (as compared to the 650) and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm.  Overall, it's a decent phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC.  Palm customer support is still useless and, as others have mentioned, the lack of a standard Mini-USB connector is simply inexcusable.  Still, I'm much happier with Palm-OS over Pocket PC.  As I use it, I see that the battery doesn't seem to last very long (just over 2 hours of talktime at the most).  I hesitantly call Palm support and get some flunkie again-  I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their "support".  I'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged.  I hate the idea of making such a compromise, but for me it's the lesser of two evils.  The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset.  They just don't care.   As clunky as my Windows MDA was, its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me (even though the MDA has a much bigger screen).  IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains-  The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people, when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo.  Most of the better designed smartphones on the market (Samsung, Motorola, HTC Wizard) are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market.  I just wish other manufacturers offered Palm-OS based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of Palm, without having to be limited to Palm's poorly designed hardware.  ....maybe it's time I finally give the Blackberry a try.... : 
 Don't get me wrong.  I like some of Meredith Monk's stuff (when she's not on some hallucinogen), but this is going to far.  Plot, musical coherence, dramatism, take your pick--unfortunately, none of it is there.  Experimentation is all well and good if you can pull it off at least with some minor hint of artistic expression, but Atlas is utterly nonsensical and way too repetitive to be considered a work of art.  If, after hearing this, you are still brave enough to give Meredith Monk another try, check out Book of Days.  It's much more musically coherent and much easier to grasp. It also, in my opinion, is a much better expression of Monk's continuing search to expand the capabilities of the human voice 
 When I watched this stinker, I felt like sniffing it and covering it up. This is just another attempt to cash in on nostalgia.  Obviously the producers of the film were aiming at parents fond memories of the Dr. Seuss classic childrens book and tried to exploit it into an updated version. It fails miserably. It is another example of Hollywood dumping tons of money on the look of a movie instead of the script. Dont get me wrong, this movie looks great. It has awesome costumes and set design but the problem is, it seems like they whipped the screenplay out in 20 minutes. Even the kids think this movie stinks. Do your child a favor, avoid this film and instead sit down and read your child the original book. They will appreciate it way more.   
 the premise of this book suggested that there might be some interesting ideas in there. what a disappointment-there are none. the book is basically a brochure for the authors movement(?)of manifestlove (as he calls it). it all reads a bit new-age, and very american...with little idea or appreciation of a whole other gay world out there beyond the u.s.a.  what makes the book ultimately pointless is that nimmons has no new ideas - he spends the best part of the book outlining what is wrong (or underappreciated) with gay men and their lives (all seen through rose-tinted glasses...especially the chapter on gay men-straight women friends...yuck!!!!!!), and then trots out some of his manifestlove ideas at the end. and consumers...since you are now hooked, you are supposed to sign up for one of his courses/camps or whatever. it is a very cynical approach to write a book to promote your own industry...and as such should be avoided! spend your money elsewhere! or better...just go for a walk on a beach at sunset and enjoy the view and the sounds of the waves...it will do you a lot more good...and make you feel way better than this book!! 
 Basic Instinct was a pretty good movie.  Basic Instinct 2, not so good.  But Sharon Stone is still HOT!  It is worth buying the movie just to see her 
 Sometimes mentioned as one of the "banned books of the bible", the Book of Jubilees covers the same ground as Genesis and part of Exodus. It's one of the books of the Pseudepigrapha, which means "writings with false superscription", according to the introduction. I found it boring and difficult to read. It shares a similarity with the Oahspe bible in one instance, where Abraham is instructed to kill Isaac by an evil spirit ("prince of the Mastema"), and he doesn't because he realises that it's a spirit and not God communicating with him. It includes fragments of old texts such as the Book of Noah and there's more reference to Enoch than in Genesis.  Overall, I would recommend it only to obsessive or completist students/scholars of the Old Testament 
 The original works of James Strong are excellent, however in the case of some of these newer books where Dr. Strong's work has been "corrected" are not so good. Corrected means shot full of errors. For example, I understand that many believe in the rapture, however the word rapture does not exist in the Bible, it is a work of man. I was so disappointed to see references to rapture in a bible dictionary because belief in the rapture alters the entire understanding of the New Testament. If I were given the option I would have given it a 0 
 I am on page 140 now, and will update later, but so far Brezny is just a Tom Robbins wannabe.  This is amateur bs.  "Her pocket graced her shirt."  That says it-graced?  He has long lists of nonsense terms that are clearly imitating Robbins, and by the way, I saw his website and he used Robbins on there, so he obviously is obsessed with him.  The book is flawed from the beginning-he launches into a internal monologue which is several pages long that we're supposed to believe that the main character has in less than a second.  Does anyone else find that seriously flawed 
 This book thinks it will be useful to computer programmers (experienced practitioners as they call them), unfortunately it is not. Apart from the numerous errors, the authors use a notation that will be unfamiliar to most programmers. The code samples are a joke (of which there are only a few). The algorithms they describe are not practical and it would take a lot more work to implement code you'd want to use in a real application based on the author's descriptions. I wish there were a geometry book that could combine theory (using a familiar notation) and practical tips and hints plus real code. I know how difficult it is to write a book and they are to be commended on the intention and scope of material they cover. It would do the community a great service if the authors could publish a second edition, taking into account some of these criticisms (As an example of a book that combines practical as well as theoretical knowledge, look at Numerical Recipes by Press et al). In its current state the book is really just a book on geometry 
 Both the introduction and the translation by Hugh Lawson-Tancred are very much below the standard one expects from Penguin. Most importantly, the English of the translation is frequently incomprehensible. I advise everyone who wants to study this masterpiece of a book to use another edition, e.g. that of George Kennedy, published by Oxford in 1991, or the Loeb edition. That is, if you want to understand why so many people in so many ages found this book brilliant 
 The Berenstain Bears and the Messy Room is about Bother and Sister Bear who never clean their room. One day, Momma bear had enough and made the cubs change their way. After talking, they decide to do something about it.  This book teaches children about responsibility. This book is good for children from 4-11. I thought it was a pretty good book 
 Theres some good music here, but theres also some bad music.  Personally I'm embarressed that some good bands actually degraded themselves by putting their music on this CD.  The people who made it our idiots and for that reason I wouldn't buy it.. 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 This pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls.  But there's no way to attach it securely to the pump! The instructions are completely useless.  Does not deserve the one star 
 This DVD is horrible, wasted my time and money, I didn't enjoy watching it. It was worse than pulling teeth. The movies from this collection is extremely horrible. The dubbing and translation was horrible and Jetli was maybe shown for a total of 10 minutes? I don't know how they can sell this DVD. I would give this 0 stars but amazon's rating won't allow it. Do yourself a favor and buy something else 
 Although this worked well on some of my blackheads, I felt it was very harsh to my skin.  I was worried that using it would create even more scars.  I would not buy this product again.  
 I subscribed to Modern Bride as a gift to my fiance.  Aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription, I only received about 3 issues total.  Months went by without anything being delivered.  While customer service at Modern Bride was very accomodating and helpful, nothing happens immediately.  When planning a wedding, each and every month is precious.  Especially during the initial stages of wedding planning.  To have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting.  Plus, by this time most of the wedding details were finalized, the magazines I received became useless.  If you're under 12 months to your wedding date, you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with Modern Bride 
 I totally agree with Ms. Horkey and the Texas School Teacher.  What a let down!I realize that the screenplay was written by  Emilio Estevez instead of S.E. Hinton (as in The Outsiders).  I will never waste my money on or embarrass my students with anything scripted by him again. Too bad I did not read their reviews before I ordered or preview it before I showed it to my ninth graders (who are learning English as a second language).  Their is no excuse or justification for such a rotten rendition of book used in schools for the past twenty years. It was so bad we had to turn off the video and just finish reading the final three chapters--totally unacceptable, and I am still angry!  If you take EE's favorite F word and the two letter preposition that tends to be used with it, this describes his rendition of a wonderful work 
 This CD is forgettable, except for "Toxic" and "Brave New Girl", but still, a CD with 2 'Ok' songs doesn't make a good CD 
 Two questions seem to be confused in all the debate between creationists and evolutionists: Does nature provide evidence for a creator God ? Does evolution play a role in the living world ?  In regard to the first question, the proponents of creation are, through their amiable but uninstructed zeal, wasting their time and also damaging the case for God by flawed reasoning. Intelligent design arguments are just special cases of arguments for the existence of God from natural form. Such arguments in principle must fail. The existence of God can only be demonstrated by arguments that appeal to the existence of natural beings, not their specific forms. This was shown (seven centuries or so ago) by Thomas Aquinas in his philosophical commentaries. In more recent times, Kant also shows that arguments from form do not suffice. Arguing through existence, Aquinas does prove the existence of God and that He is the ultimate author of all else that exists. For a thorough, and amazingly succint account of the science of being as being, that is, metaphysics, everyone is invited and urged to consult Elementary Christian Metaphysics by Joseph Owens.  There will be an in-class test next Tuesday.  Whether evolution plays a role in the living world must be decided from examination of the details of the material world. The situation is analogous to the question of whether the universe extends backwards infinitely in time; nature must be consulted. Naturally, one who accepts the Bible as divinely inspired will have to take seriously the claims it makes concerning the origin of the world and the origin of life. One attempting to argue on philosophical and scientific grounds in this area is obliged to work through and understand Aristotle and Aquina's writings on nature. The question at hand really comes down to the question of whether natures exist and whether what we call living are natures. Actually, the whole story is pretty much indicated by Aristotle in the Physics, especially and succinctly in book B, 8 and doesn't leave much room for evolution. Let's stop wasting time and instead invest our energies in a better understanding of what biology really does. And for fun how about a few out of the box speculations, such as  taking the Genesis account in its details as a guide to understanding all life ? The text, properly understood, should provide hints to elucidating biology. Go on, I dare you  
 Ive never done a review before because I have never been so disgusted with a product.  Ive had mine a few weeks. Used it twice a week.. which equals roughly 10 uses so far. Well, just now the little knob that gets screwed in to hoold the arm in place to prevent it from swinging BROKE.. cracked right in half as I was turning it with my fingers. I didnt even put any weight into it!!  Last week the nut that holds the eye hook and entire weight of the heavy bag fell off sending my bag crashing to the ground. I dont know why they wouldnt put something more permanent up there instead of a 2 cent nut.  The design is terrible. Rather than have the supports and screw holes run the length of the wall studs they have then run so you  mount two in the studs two in the drywall.. unless of course you do the wood mount like another user suggested ( which is what I did ).  TKO just lost me. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again. Seventy dollars for this CHinese made garbage. Im sure the welds will be the next thing to go.   Buyer bewar 
 I love to people watch.  I adore the human body and appreciate all the different forms and characters it comes in.  I bought the book because of it's promise to help show me How to Understand People And Predict Their Behavior.  I work with parents of young children (this ranges from beauty to the beast in character kingdom).  Parents come to me for help and I know that every person has a story behind him/her that presents itself as raw and unfriendly behavior at times.  I wanted to learn to be more empathetic to them.  Everything I learned about people, I learned on the job just by being attentive to people.  You probably know more than you think about reading people.  For example, a tanned face may reveal that the person's job or hobbies put him outdoors for considerable periods.  And people whose skin is very pale generally have few outdoor hobbies.  See, you probably can predict people already!  But if you want to see it put into lots and lots of words then this book will do that.   It could be fun to use the formulas to your advantage, you can derail the people-reader into thinking that you're happy just by humming! 
 I have read about 10 real estate investment books within the last 6 months, and despite the Amazon.com user reviews, this book probably was the least informative, least well written, and least organized of the lot.  The author refers to his real estate investment experience several times throughout the book, yet he discusses only the single property he has purchased, disqualifying him as a mentor in my mind.  He write without technicality, and fills much of the book quoting other "real estate gurus" and citing summaries of text he has read.  I am really surprised that this book was rates so highly on this site, because it really has been a disappointment and waste of time.  By the way, some of the best books I have read have been written by Dolf De Roos.  Best of luck to you all 
 An admiring though shallow and poorly written account of a unique American genius. Though salted with several good anecdotes, Gordon's book mostly relies on the research and interviews of others and ultimately does little to explain McKinley Morganfield's life and times. For a writer who presumes to account for the life of a musician, Gordon's descriptions of various Waters recordings are especially poor. Far far better is his video documentary of the same name. One suspects the book is the assembled notes of that project 
 THIS IS A GREAT CD IF YOU ARE A MUSIC LOVER AS I AM.BILLY COBHAM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DRUMMERS EVER!!! 
 Describing the Democratic Party as the "party of death" is classic phony-con propaganda designed to attract attention without engaging in intelligent debate.  The notion that the Republican Party is "pro-life" is one of the greatest scams ever perpetrated on the American public.  Republicans support the death penalty, and the Iraq war which has caused the deaths of thousands of Americans and thousands of non-combatant Iraqi civilians.  As governor of Texas, George W. Bush presided over more state-sponsored executions than any governor in the history of the United States.  This included people who were determined by medical experts, unanimously, to be mentally retarded and incapable of understanding their actions or the punishment that awaited them.  So much for respecting life.  It is also a blatant lie to claim that abortion is the central theme of the Democratic Party.  Democrats stand for freedom of choice in all aspects of life.  They stand for the rights of individuals to live their lives without interference from an unchecked government and religious zealots.  That is the fundamental premise on which the United States was founded.  Anyone who wants to understand the true impact of legalized abortion, without a lot of hateful name-calling, should read Freakonomics by Levitt & Dubner.  Let thinking, feeling, Americans consign Ponnuru to the garbage-can where he belongs 
 I only paid 60 cents in a used bookstore for this piece of tripe, but figured I used to live in Texas and like political stories, so .....  Then, I found the book so bad, so ridiculous I had to  keep going to make sure it would be on my list of real stinkers.  It is.  Just because you write for films, doesn't make you an author.  The writing was not bad, but I would suggest Mr. Richardson pay someone to give him a decent plot.  Additionally, the stereotype description of Texas and its citizens is quite insulting - very Hollywood.  So it's been sold and will be made into yet another bad movie.  It is really a shame and I did not find it "fun" or "enjoyable" because it was not good satire, it was just plain awful.  You can be sure if this guy keeps writing (I see it did write another which sounds even worse), I won't be reading and anyone who has good taste should avoid his books as well 
 I bought this when it first came out,knowing nothing about the chicago mob except the name Al Capone.Even not knowing about Giancana going in I felt there was plenty of nonsense in this book.St.Valentine's Day Massacre?JFK?RFK?Marylin Monroe?Fidel Castro?CIA?You guessed it,Giancana had a hand in all the deaths and controlled the world from his home in Oak Park,Illinois(where he was murdered,by the way).This book is a sham,written by a brother and nephew of Giancana who never let the truth get in the way of the story they tell.If you want a true picture of Giancana's role in the Castro matter,or anything else about him(he was approached by the CIA but never actually did anything except tell Johnny Roselli to string them along),read William Brashler's excellent The Don or William Roemer's Man Against The Mob,two books that have facts,not drivel.Tony Accardo not powerful enough to override a Giancana decision?Guess who had Giancana murdered by Sam's best friend?Accardo,the real boss of Chicago,that's who(not the shadowy govt killer the authors would have you believe) 
 This model was much more expensive than other brands because it was made from "Sony". I believed the product will meet my expectations since it was more expensive than Samsung or LG.  Anyways after using it for a month I already have two dead pixels(both RED). And very frequently I get these white pixels which I need to press with a cotton swab so it turns back to normal.   Save your money and go for another product! 
 "Cloud 9" presents problems and situations that are often not discussed.  Such situations are gays, incest, and women's rights.  Churchill does a wonderful job at presenting the situations in a non-bias  manner.  However, many readers do not care about these issues, reguardless  of how they are presented 
 The problem with this movie is the same problem I see in 90% of movies released by Disney. Although I seem to be the only person to notice this, most Disney movies are a beginning and an end with little to no substance in the middle. In this film for instance, Simba is your normal curious, happy and mischevious child just of course, he's a lion who is next in line to become the next king. His father is thrown off the side of a mountain killing him which causes Simba's problem. Led to believe he is the cause he runs into exile. Good way to start an animated Children's movie I think. About 7-10 minutes later he's grown and on his way to reclaim his place. Where the depth of the story should be is put into a short montage instead of showing his feelings and growing up and when he accepts his reponsability you never fully get a feeling of how hard it is for him. And how easily convinced he is to come back is lame in it self. Timone and Pumba are good characters to have an mixed with The Hiena's(however you spell that) make for really funny characters. But the story as most Disney movies sucks and is really just recycled from every other Disney movie. With exception of the Pirates Of The Carribean movies the company really has done nothing I see should give it half the hype it gets. And on a quick side note. Am I the only one who feels like Disney only spits out these movies to create the endless stream of merchindise that makes the weakest of characers a god in the Disney world. I mean, you can buy an action figure of the midget in the Pirate movies and making Snot Rod who appears in Cars for like 1.5 minutes in like 5 diffent toy car forms that I've seen. Disney Movies in General are nothing more than 85 minute long comercials for a slew of cloths, toys and other worthless collectables. The whole reason the Pirates of The Carribean was ever conceived was to advertise a a ride within Disney World. You can say movies like Dogma, Scarface and The Exorcist are evil. But none try to draw your worship and aww harder than Disney. In other words Disney is the real Devil and Watching Disney movies will damn you to HELL!!!-haha. (for real. watch if you want. but if people gonna dog my taste for being more racey I'm gonna spend that judgemental pendelum around and let you think about what could truly be a sin against God. Remember the 1st Commandment and see if Disney isn't trying to go against it with the way it attempts to pound these characters into your and your kid's head so much that it;s as if these movies, merchindise and mouse ears are the worlds greatest gifts to mankind as if Mickey Mouse is Jesus Christ himself reincarnated as a dirty f**kin' rat 
 The comforter has great colors and the lightsaber duel looks excellent.  However, as many of the other reviewers noted, the materials used are lousy.  As parents, we want things our children love, but we want them to be comfortable.  These sheets are definitely not warm, cozy, and comfortable.  I would prefer to pay a little extra for quality and comfort for my kids 
 Pages 1003 thru 1050 were missing in my copy. Pages 1051 thru 1098 were repeted.  Check your copy carefully. The book would have been more helpful if all the pages indicated in the index existed.  
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Its been over two weeks and I still haven't received this order or an email saying why 
 Ted Dekker is a total "hit or miss" with me. I began my foray into his work with Thr3e and literally could not finish the book. But, assured by a friend I trusted, I gave him another shot and picked up Black. I was not disappointed. The day I finished Black, I got Red and the day I finished Red, I began White. I absolutely loved The Circle Trilogy, so you can imagine my eagerness when I discovered Showdown, which is roughly a continuation of the Trilogy, centering around the mysterious Books of History which bring written words into real life.  Showdown begins with promise, builds weakly, and putters to a pathetic end. Is there any action in Showdown? Plenty, I suppose. Actually, Showdown is a fairly gory and violent story. I would not recommend it to anyone under the age of maybe 15. If it were to be made into a movie as written, it would be rated "R", "PG-13" at the least.  The story is about a tiny, isolated town in Colorado. It literally has one grocery store, one church, one beauty shop, and once had a movie theater. The town of Paradise (such an awfully cliche' name, all things considered) has a population of about 400, but we only really get the feeling that it's populated by about twenty. The remaining population are only briefly referenced a few times, which skews the feel of the story, in my opinion.  The opening scene is pretty good, actually. Johnny Drake, a boy of about fourteen, is sitting with his old (very old) friend Cecil as a stranger decked out in what can only be described as a gunslinger's getup from a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western, strides into town on foot. Marsuvees Black is an outlaw prophet come to Paradise to bring the sleeping residents a message of "grace and hope" and to shake things up a little.  In the first few pages, Black murders 80 year old Cecil by scaring him into a heart attack and Johnny Drake is the only witness. From this point forward, young Johnny is the only person in Paradise who is able to resist the charms and deceptions Black brings to the town.  Beginning at the Episcopal church that night, Black calls a town meeting where he wows the people with a sleight-of-hand show that really gets everyone's attention. Who doesn't like to be entertained at church, after all? He openly challenges the pastor, Father Stanley Yordon, who leaves almost immediately the following day for a conference with the Bishop in Denver and does not return for several days. I was fully expecting Stanley to return and do something of consequence, but in all fairness to the story, he was absolutely useless as a character except that Dekker needed a church and a church needs a pastor. Well, and there's the affair with Johnny's mother, Sally. And their child. I won't spoil that should anyone reading this actually decide to read Showdown. Still, it really didn't add to the story.  After getting to very briefly (and shallowly) know the characters in Paradise, we move to a mysterious monastery where a group of orphans are attending a special school. In reality, they are the unknowing participants in a spiritual experiment organized by the headmaster, David Abraham (yes, just like Abraham in the Bible). It turns out that Marsuvees Black is one of the monks "teaching" the 37 or so students at the school. The students are taught primarily through writing. Everything centers around writing and for good reason: the mysterious blank Books of History we first hear about in The Circle Trilogy have appeared here. If you were perplexed by Dekker's ending in White, you will now solve the mystery of who Billy is. Billy is a thirteen or fourteen year old "orphaned" student at the seminary who is an exceptional thinker and writer.  In fact, his only real challenger is Samuel Abraham, the son of the headmaster.  We learn that there are forbidden tunnels under the monastery and that Billy has been tempted by Black to enter them where he discovers the blank Books of History. (The Books of History have he ability to create history based on whatever is written in them, so long as the writer has "the faith of a child", which, given the age of the children, was a bit unconvincing to me.  Whoever has seen a preteen who was filled with nothing more than angst and sarcasm?) Billy also discovers the giant worms (which are never really explained) that live in the tunnels and excrete a hallucinogenic sludge that seems to help blind him to the evil lurking about. In time, Billy begins to coerce his friends to visit the forbidden tunnels, which finally leads to a "debate" (one of the many "showdowns" of the book and just about the weakest "debate" I've ever read), resulting in a drastic change in the way the monastery operates. A majority of the students follow Billy down into the dungeons and are conscripted into helping him write his story. A story about an evil prophet who visits a sleepy little town called Paradise, Colorado...  I won't belabor on with more details, except to point out that the story is just incredibly weak. The characters are extremely shallow and the circumstances are just too unbelievable, even as a supernatural fantasy/thriller. Dekker does a poor job creating characters you care about, which is surprising because he did such a good job of that very thing in The Circle Trilogy. Several characters are brutalized, some are murdered, and I found I just didn't care. I felt I was just reading words on a page (actually at the half way point of the book, I was seriously wondering whether I would even bother finishing it. It did get better after that point, but only just.)  One big problem I had was how unusually remote the town was.  It just didn't make sense when the phones went out and the power failed that SOMEBODY didn't notice.  Don't these folks have families?  If you live in a remote area, aren't there like REGULAR deliveries or some sort of near DAILY contact made?  What about law enforcement?  Heck, what about the MAIL?!  The central message of Showdown is actually very good and full of meaning to Christians. "Grace and Hope without Love is powerless." In the end, sacrificial love is what saves the day. But his way of telling the story--of illustrating the power of love--had no power. Young Samuel's selfless act in the end meant absolutely nothing because he had nothing invested and therefore, nothing risked; no real reason to give his life to save the people of Paradise (or his "dear friend" Johnny), and without that very important connection, it had virtually no meaning for me and therefore no power. Words on a page.  I felt I had been beat over the head with allegory instead of told a fascinating tale about characters I cared about and those wonderful blank books. I didn't even hate the villains! How can you not at least hate the villains?! Lack of good character development really hampered the story. Dekker does a passable job with dialog, although he has the fourteen year olds sounding like eight year olds at times, and like proper Victorian ladies at other times. Who winks anymore? If I see a fourteen year old kid winking at another kid, I'm calling the cops.  I also found his use of everyday language in the narration to be annoying.  It almost read like a fourteen year old had written it. Hmmm...  The biggest problem I had with the story is the way the extreme conflicts were resolved.  Far too trite and fatalistic, in my opinion.  There's just no tension without risk, and NO risk where fate is concerned.  Well, they were "fantastic" in a sense and would look cool on a movie screen (anybody see a pattern here?), but they just didn't make much sense. Dekker seems to draw out the story with a few "key" revelations that don't make sense, either.  Yes, the revelations themselves made sense, I guess, but why his characters kept them hidden until "everyone was ready" did not. It became clear that he needed to push the plot and stretch the story.  Big mistake, in my opinion.  It subtracted credibility from his characters and from him as an author.  As I said, I absolutely LOVED The Circle Trilogy (Black, Red, and White), but I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time reading Showdown. On a scale of one to five, I rate it a solid two. (Hey, at least I finished it! I couldn't finish Thr3e!)  It's obvious Ted Dekker is a good writer from The Circle Trilogy.  Why he didn't put those same skills to use in Showdown is the biggest mystery of all 
 Goldstein's Classical Mechanics is one of the worst books I have ever read on the subject. It is disturbing that it could have been published on the first place since it is full of very serious omissions and mistakes.  The classical mechanics is based on two basic experimental facts, which lie at its foundations: The Newton-Laplace principle of determinacy and Galileo's principle of relativity.  These fundamental principles are never stated in the book. More over the authors are confused about such elementary notions as phase space and configuration space probably due to the fact that phase space could be identified with a tangent bundle or cotangent bundle of the configuration space depending weather we use Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formalism.  After the reading of this book novice reader might be under the false impression that the most of mechanical systems are integrable since all examples and problems stated in this book are of that type. There is no place in this book for Arnold-Liouville's theorem on integrability.   Even such elementary topics like the chapter on Rigid Body are full of  serious mistakes as mixing of the body and space coordinates. The authors prefer lengthy "intuitive" explanations to the few simple lemmas from the operator theory.  A short excursion to non-holonomic mechanics is disastrous and should be considered as totally wrong. The same goes for the chapters on canonical transformations, Hamilton-Jacobi theory and action-angle variables.   This list goes on and on.    The book in its present form is beyond repair and should not be used 
 How can you write a new biography about the Virgin Mary when you have only the gospels? Lesley Hazelton's solution is to use anthropological and historical information to fill the background. Starting off with the basic facts about being a first century Jewish peasant, she uses information about Galilee, being a healer, pregnancy and childbirth, first century polytheism, and nasty details about crucifixion. In her view Mary, or Maryam, was pregnant at thirteen. She was probably a healer who taught her son. She certainly would have assisted the rebellion that broke out on the death of Herod the Great in 4 BCE. She may have been raped, possibly by a solider, possibly by priests. Notwithstanding that traumatic event, she was "a strong woman of ability and wisdom who actively chose her role in history, and lived it to the fullest." Now a reader might look at Hazleton's rather sparse notes, and note some scholarship, but a closer look would reveal that never gives page numbers. In fact this is simply a reverse of the old devotional lives. Where they portrayed Mary as an exemplar of Christian dogma, she portrays her as a New Age hero. Both do violence to the real Jewish Mary.    One of Hazleton's flaws is anachronism of evidence. She relies on a mid-century history of Palestinian peasant life, and then assumes that there were no changes in the intervening nineteen centuries. She uses Barbara Ehrenreich's deeply flawed book on medieval midwives to argue that Mary would have been a healer. Even if women were healers at that time, it does not follow that Mary would be one of them. She uses information from the Intafada to argue that Mary would have supported the rebellion on Herod's death. (Later still she argues, against the evidence of both Matthew and Luke, that Jesus was actually born ten years after Herod's death, which means that Mary would have been 2 at the time of the rebellion.) There are other examples of Hazleton's shallow grasp of Palestinian history. Contrary to what she says, there is some evidence of synagogues at the time in Galilee. Herod the Great would not have thought about declaring himself a divinity, since he was actually Jewish. Palestine was not of strategic value because it was part of the Grain land route from Egypt to Rome; grain would have been shipped entirely by sea. Contrary to what Hazleton says, Galileans in the Roman era were not descended from the old Israeli monarchy. They were fervently Jewish who probably descended from settlers in the second century.     These errors allow Hazleton to make the preposterous claim that Mary was a Goddess worshipper, and even said prayers to Isis! There is no evidence to support such a suggestion. Josephus refers to the Galilean's devotion, and the archaeological evidence clearly shows that there was no major Gentile presence at this time. Exclusive monotheism is one of the clearest and best attested ideas of first century Judaism. There is certainly no evidence that Mary would have been aware of the esoteric, much later, gnostic speculation that Hazleton (of course) links her to. But then Hazleton's ideas about religion are pretty sentimental. She has John the Baptist believe "that God was inside you, not in a temple," an idea that was "an early manifestation of the democratic spirit." In point of fact John clearly argued that the world faced imminent judgement for its sins. Hazleton may prefer the cosmopolitan and tolerant virtues of paganism, but they have nothing to do with Mary. One should add that the book in infected with purple prose about fertility and Mary's grief over the crucifixion. One should note that Hazleton talks about things that she has no way of knowing, such as saying there was no "romance" in first century Palestine, or what age girls were married at, or how many children they were likely to have, or what Mary's grandmother was like. There are also several pages where Hazleton tries to have it both ways on Mary's sexuality. Obviously Mary isn't drearily celibate, but on the other hand it would be crudely rationalist to deny her virginity.     The simplest explanation is also the most reasonable. There is no evidence that Mary was a Christian, only that she survived the death of her son. Both Paul and the Gospels clearly state that Jesus had siblings. To say that they were merely cousins or kinsmen is simply gratuitous assertion, which can be gratuitously denied. Christian dogma denied Mary her family and her religion because it undercut the doctrine of perpetual virginity and, more important, the Incarnation. Hazleton does the same thing, but claims that this is an act of empowerment. Readers should not be similarly deluded 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!    I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself.  
 I purchased this book because after searching the entire internet, it was the only item that I could find that showed a curtain for an arched window.  The book was helpful in making a pattern but was very vague in its instructions.  Since I have been sewing for 36 years I was able to overcome that obstacle, but beginning sewers will have difficulty following the instructions.  So, if you're an experienced seamstress and want to make a curtain for an arched (or half moon) window, buy this book, if not, think twice 
 This is the weakest book Mr. Marquez ever wrote-a living proof that autobiographies written by the writers are sentimental drag. His usual style of fantastic truth and romatic albeit very sad fantasy is nowhere to be found. If you love Marquez, do not read this book 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 abandon this book and get eckehard shultz's a students grammar of MSA. It is far superior to this book in every way: it is more concise, the examples are much more pertinent and plentiful, the printing and paper is better so the type (both english and arabic) is much easier on the eyes, and the concepts are explained in straightforward, easy to understand english, punctuated with excellent examples for all grammatical situations, none of which are archaic and outdated. This book sucks. It will waste your time and have you re-reading passages. Shultz's is the way to go, no question 
 This is not a review of the books, but of the Amazon entry for this item.  It's a slipboxed collection of six books out of the series.  Fine, but which six?  There are forty books in the series, after all.  Nowhere on the page can I find this information.  You'd think the actual titles of the books are kind of important....  Also, while I'm about it, who the !@#$%^ is "W. Rev Awdry"?  Rev is not a name, or at least it wasn't the author's name.  The first 26 books were written by The Reverend Wilbert Vere Awdry, OBE, and the next 14 by Christopher Awdry.  Another thing: The illustrator is said in the heading to be C. Reginald Dalby, but from the picture it appears that one of the books in the set is Thomas the Tank Engine (#2 in the series), which was illustrated by Reginald Payne.  Dalby illustrated books #3 (James) through #11 (Percy) 
 Embraced By The Light by Betty J. Eadie is actually a pretty good book, well written, and probably well-researched from other people's NDE's.  This book is filled with some great stuff, but also some not so great stuff.  Eventually, no matter how open your mind is, it becomes clearer and clearer that some of these things are either made up or a rip-off from other NDE accounts.  The author seems sincere and it is a heartfelt account.  I could actually feel myself in her shoes in each page of the book, and empathize with her.  The book is heart-wrenching at times and I actually sobbed.  Not so much in sorrow, but a sadness mixed with joy.  The book is very bittersweet but filled with hope, and it provides an invaluable message...  That the most important thing in life is to enjoy life and to love each other.  Now what I just wrote would make the book worth 5 stars.  However, this is where the scale tips backwards.  The book is biased.  She goes on to say that while she was in "heaven" in her NDE, she realized that the creator of the Universe and all else is Jesus Christ himself.  Of course the description of Jesus is the typical white man with a beard with a light glowing from within his beard.  That's all fine and good.  BUT, Mrs. Eadie forgets to say that the creator of the Universe presented itself to HER as Jesus Christ.  This is not a Universal Truth, it is the author's truth.   Eadie makes a good point that while in "heaven," she learned that it is foolish to criticize other people's religious beliefs, or lack of...  Then she ruins this promising statement by indicating that Christianity is at the top rung and that all other religions don't hold the same love and promises as the gospel.  To a Christian or Mormon, this would make sense, but the TRUTH is that all religions or lack of them are EQUAL.  Christianity is no better than Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Wicca, Paganism, Tao, or any others.  To think that one is better, more true, or superior to another (even if the bible says so), is just plain ignorance.  The bias on the importance of men is another downfall for the book, going back to women being weaker in nature than men and that it was "Eve's impatience" or whatever in the "garden of eden" (a biblical fable no more true than the myth of Pandora's Box) that brought death into the world.   Men and women are EQUAL, period.  This book also slams the concept of reincarnation.  Reincarnation can't quite be scientifically proven, but it is on the brink.  Shame on you Mrs. Eadie.  But if that's her perspective and what she thought she learned in "heaven," than she is entitled to her "conclusion."  Remember folks...  There can be as many similarities in many individual's Near-Death Experiences as there are differences.  Something that is important to know is that Jesus or Jehovah or Angels are not any more true, real, living, or righteous than Pan, Dionysus, Horus, Osiris, Isis, Demeter, Diana, Hecate, Buddha, Shiva, Krishna, etc, for representations of the Creator.  People need to decide for themselves which form of God or Goddess (YES, GOD COULD BE FEMALE, it's not impossible, no matter what the bible, the kuran, or the book or mormon says) to believe in and/or worship.  Overall, this is a decent book, despite its faults and biases.  To a Christian, Mormon, and/or a New Ager, who is dealing with death and dying, or has someone close to you who is, I highly recommend this book to you.  Even to non-Christians, this isn't an entirely bad read, but there are much better accounts for non-Christians and all are just as valid as Mrs. Eadie's.  Remember, the most important thing in life is to enjoy it and to love one another.  
      It starts out with this Mexican family illegally coming across the border into the United States. When they get to the U.S., they go to a labor camp in California. This first labor camp is probably the best one that they go to. The whole book is about this family moving around to different labor camps during different crop seasons. Every now and then, Francisco and his brother Roberto go to school. Along the way there are more people added to the family. The book doesn't really come to a good ending. It is also kind of hard to understand because it jumps three years into the future at times and then you don't know what's going on. 	This was a very good book at some times but most of the time the author put in way too many unnecessary details that make the book kind of boring. This book is exactly like it's sequel, Breaking Through. I would rate this book pretty low if like a lot of action.  
 First of all this book is way overpriced here (or maybe in general in English). I own a translated copy which was like 10-15$.  As for the content, at one hand it is the best general overview with many fun examples from literature. It is much better than Rachels's book for example.  On the other hand Pojmans discussions about objectivism (ch. 3) and his chapters on relativism (2), value (4) and meta-ethics (11-12)are deeply confused. The biggest confusion seems to stem from the fact that he does not adequately distinguish between the meta-level and the normative level.  His arguments for normative objectivism seem to get their strength from some realist or meta-ethical objectivist assumptions that aren't given any arguments for. His arguments against Mackie and Harman on meta-level depend on his own assumptions on normative level - he just mixes the meta-level stuff with normative level stuff. His discussion of value is again strange - he says in one footnote that he didn't really need to make a difference between intrinsic value in the sense of end-value (something that is valued as an end in itself) and realist intrinsic value (value that is part of the fabric of the universe, sometimes called inherent value). But that is a very very important distinction since there might be values that are of the first kind while I would deny that there are any of the second kind. He simply dismisses it and then goes on to talk about both interrelatedly and not making clear which he has in mind at the time.   All in all read it if you have to, but if you want to get a good overview on contemporary ethics (especially meta-ethics, which is the foundation to all) start somewhere else. Having some prior understanding of the issues at hand would be good if you intend to read it - this would enable you to see where Pojman commits mistakes 
 The chapter on General Sherman was great - but then he was one of my ancestors and I could be biased. The chapters are acollection of essays and do vary considerably.  The other chapters were almost all were flawed because Hanson's polemic is based on much better understanding of the Classics and, to some degree, the West than the contemporary world or Islam. Sometimes this is clear because either the reasoning or overly broad conclusions are visible to a careful reader. Other times the neo Con bias informs the selection and presentation more subtly.  Overall more pompous than profound 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 I loved this magazine in 1995, until a few years ago.  They have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads.  No new information.  Glossy pics of models with bright red lips.  What is about health here?  Get Life Extension magazine and Alternative Medicine Magazine.  They've changed too over the last few years, but still a far sight better than this one 
 This book is quite bad with the analysis, and if you want to read a book about Patton's life, D'Este's work is the one to go to.  Some of the conclusions are simply lunacy, unfounded in anything but the writers opinion, as mentioned before of Patton's fiery speeches.  Did these cause atrocities?  Do not even kid me with this.  I've read too much to be suckered in by this book 
 This book is a long winded explanation of the features of SharePoint 2003.  It provides redundent how tos with little explanation of how to do anything that is not vanilla out of the box.  I suggest simply becoming familar with the Administrative Guide that Microsoft produced.  You'll be you degree closer to the source and 33 dollars richer in the pocket. 
 In the years since September 11th, 2001 many authors have tried their hands at the 9/11 novel, with all of its delicate subject matter, and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success: Jonathan Safran Foer, Julia Glass, Wendy Wasserstein, and others have centered novels on the pre- and post-9/11 era, and now Claire Messud takes her turn with "The Emperor's Children," a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day. The titular 'emperor' is Murray Thwaite, a prestigious journalist living the quintessential Manhattan lifestyle: fame, money, parties, and the adoration of literati and socialites alike. He has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity, although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person. His 'children' are the people immediately surrounding him, captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness. At the novel's onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life's direction. First and foremost is Marina, Murray's daughter, who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence -- afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father's reputation (the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her). It is easy to forget that Marina is 30 years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite. Then there is Murray's nephew, Frederick "Bootie" Tubb,  who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to Manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor. Bootie, an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man, quickly becomes disillusioned with Murray (for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces?), and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be. Complicating things further is Ludovic Seeley, a smarmy Australian businessman who has come to Manhattan to start his own magazine -- and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king. Ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon. Lastly, there are Marina's best friends: Julius, a gay hanger-on from chilly Michigan eager to make an impression on the New York social scene, and Danielle, who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on, but suffers from such ludicrous Ally McBeal-esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages. The characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying, but Messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because, as shallow as they are, they are all multi-layered, complex, believable people. The many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies (even if you wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them). But that willingness to stick with their stories is, at least for me, predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel's end. They aren't. And while the narrative is expertly crafted, Messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes, increasingly, irritating, as she uses them to stretch out her sentences, and to add separate thoughts, or descriptive elements, and even, occasionally, dialogue, so that they feel like run-ons, like this one right here, this example I've devised for you, but are, for the most part, technically, grammatically sound, even though you may have to re-read the most trying sentences a second time, just to figure out what she is saying, without letting all of her distractions get in the way.   Messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and September 11th draws near. There is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found, some directly indicating that September will be a month of great change, what with Ludovic's magazine set to launch on the 13th and a wedding to take place, but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be. The sense of impending disaster looms large in "The Emperor's Children," and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes. Indeed, 9/11 is almost anticlimactic when it occurs, serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone's story lines. It was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed. In the late afternoon of that day, after the towers had fallen and Manhattan's skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn't a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters. All they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars (I felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when Ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine's launch had to be cancelled). I live in the tri-state area, about an hour and a half away from Ground Zero, and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life, and what Messud has critically failed to capture is the way that 9/11 actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time, and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand. I remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other, the phone calls I made to -- and received from -- people I hadn't even spoken to in months or even years, just to make sure that they were all right. I remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out, whether the need was great or small. This incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world, but it is conspicuously absent from Messud's telling. One character uses the tragedy for personal gain career-wise, one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity (not for anything to do with 9/11, mind you, but for strictly personal reasons) ... I don't want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much, but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate. I had hoped that tragedy would change the Emperor and his Children for the better, but I was wrong. And it's a shame. Messud is definitely a capable, promising writer -- but this isn't her finest hour

 I have never written a book review before for Amazon, but felt I needed to save other readers from this book.  It started out just fine, but started to get plain silly and ridiciulous by the half way mark. By the time I approached the end I forced myself to finish and I should not have. It was a waste of my time. Please believe the readers who have given this book a poor review before me 
 I've begun reading this book and I was sailing with Thomas Moore real tight.  He was skillfully sailing the ship until I got to his fourth chapter where he got off into a skiff and cut the rope.  He has set me adrift in a wide sea without a moral compass.    He leads his readers into the occult and astrology. A place where a former Monk should fear to tread. While I don't mind learning about insights of the dark night through greek mythology and other lesser known personalities, I feel Mr. Moore could have served his readers better examples by using concepts and personalities from the Judeo-Christian tradition.   Mr. Moore holds too highly the concept of self and self fulfullment.  What I understood from Part Two of the book "Disturbances" is don't take responsibility for your choices.  Follow what you feel you must do in order to develop your inner self and talents even it that means to destroy and hurt your relationship with family and friends.  Jesus' idea was in losing one's self that we find out true self.   I haven't finished the book yet so I guess it's a bit unfair to write a review so soon. However, I thought I would tear through this book because the first 68 pages held so much meaning for me.  I've gotten bogged down in the middle and have picked up another book by James Finley which is an expose of Thomas Merton's thought.  Merton's Palace of Nowhere -A search for God through Awareness for the True Self.  I love this book.  What I am discovering from Merton is that the self we construct is an illusion but we need to find our true self through our search and union with God.  I believe this is the true purpose of the Dark night of the Soul which is to lead us to the realization of our need for grounding in the source of life.  I have two more books by Moore which I plan to read. Care of the Soul and The Re-enchantment of Every Day life.  So stay tune 
 I love cookbooks and own thousands, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen - it seems comprised of everything I loathe in a cookbook. It contains many recipes, but no descriptions of what makes them special (and no descriptions at all).  There are often several recipes for the same dish, but nothing to signify what is different about them, which tastes best, etc.  The index sucks (very, very vague) - and 99% of the recipes are not listed in either the table of contents or the index, so the only way to find them is to scroll through the entire book.  There is a full chapter on kuchen recipes, but the word kuchen isn't anywhere in the index, nor are the recipes.  This book was a total waste!  I don't even know if the author ever tasted, much less prepared, any of the dishes - and most definitely can't understand why she was allowed to give herself five stars.  There are many wonderful breakfast cookbooks, and most (if not all) are available here on Amazon.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE 
 I am so seriously disappointed with this version of Spirograph. The old model had a squire and long Popsicle type disk along with several other drawing disks.  The problem with this model is the prongs do not hold the disks in place very well.  This causes the disk to slide under the drawing stencil.   Oh and you only have three different drawing stencils/outlines unlike the old model. When I was young my sister (who is 9 years older than me) and I loved this "toy" and we would draw for literally hours. It was cool for every age group!  I was so excited to see this in the "deluxe" version. My son was frustrated with this model in about one minute so I tried it out and I gave up after a few tries as well. Honestly, I ( a 40 year old lady) bought it for myself and just pretended it was for my son.  Although, this is not an expensive toy.... It is NOT worth your money ... it truly does not work well.... and I am really sad about that!  
 I have never read a book so boring in my life!  I read Erotique Noir, and  there were good poems here and there.  I was hoping Dark Eros would have  filled the gaps that were left by Erotique Noir, but the poems and writings  just got more and more boring.  There were VERY few writings I would have  even considered to be even remotley called erotica.  I am very dissapointed  in this effort.  Its seems who ever put it together has lost the passion we  feel as a pepole 
           When I recieved the shelf it did not have the poles in the box to attach the top shelf. I emailed the company and did not recieve any response back from them. I had to use just the bottom shelf. I WILL NOT order anything else from these people,because they will not stand behind their products 
 Look, I dig stand up, and I dig fat jokes, but this guy isn't that great.  I got a friend who loves John Pinette, but I can't see it.  He tells jokes about how fat he is, how he likes to eat, how he doesn't like to move.  Its the same over and over and over again.  Its dull and it's too easy.  They're not even jokes, really, just comments on how fat he is.  Also a fair part of his act consists of "asian people talk with accents and thats funny" which I find cheap.  Stereotypes shouldn't be jokes, and even when they are, they shouldn't be THE joke.  John says something with broken english and the audience laughs really hard.  Why?  Why is that funny, here in the 20th century?  Maybe I just don't "get" his humor, but I don't think this guy is any good.  I perfer comedians who tell jokes.  On the plus side, this guy is clean, which is rare these days.  But there are better clean comedians around.   Try getting a Brian Regan album or an Emo Philips album.  Jerry Seinfelds album is good too.  Try those guys because they're clean and legitimately funny 
 Michael Jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters/singers of our time. You can discuss his person, you can discuss his behaviour, and all the other stuff, but you can't really take that away from him. And that's exactly why this album is so unacceptable, coming from someone like him - when you've reached superstardom and gone beyond it, you don't release a record that's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it's bound to be a faliure. At least, you should expect to hear for it. And hear for it he did, cause the critics didn't go lightly on this one. And it's not that bad, actually. I mean, that's what I have my program function in my CD-player for, and my CD-burner.  The album starts on a fair streak - Unbreakable, Heartbreaker and Invincible - are all fair tracks - below average for MJ, sounds like a watered down selection of discarded tracks from Dangerous that were then discarded for HIStory and then discarded for Blood On The Dance Floor, and full of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from that, if you forget who made this music, these are actually good, funky dance tracks. For Michael Jackson they're passable, but nothing more. *SKIP*  On to track 8 - Speechless - arguably the strongest moment on the record. One of only two tracks that Jackson actually penned himself, and it shows. The amount of emotion in his voice will knock you prone, and actually proves very well what the rest of the album lacks: Joy for the music, and personal emotion. The lyrics are like a poem, and one of the most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity. Top grade to Jackson for this one track, and if you are into his music, buy the CD cheeply just to get this track.  Track 9 - 2000 Watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record. This one is simply plain fun, and that's another important lesson Jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns, and stop caring whether it's hip or street or down with the trend - because it isn't - but this is darn good pop music, and nigh irresistable. *SKIP*  On to track 13 - Cry - penned by R. Kelley. The same R. Kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most horrible songs of all times (I Believe I Can Fly, if you had doubts), but it seems that with Jackson, he can do no wrong. He wrote the endearing You Are Not Alone - major hit in Europe - and this track is possibly even better. Oh, forget about the sappy lyrics, and just enjoy the wonderfull music. This is pop writing in top class, and if Jackson sounds like he takes the Marthyr role a bit too seriously, it's still one of the best tracks on the record.  Track 14 - The Lost Children - is the other song penned by Michael alone, and it's not a bad effort - had it not been for the children choir and sleezy intro, you could probably have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune. As it is, it falls somewhat flat, and becomes completely choking in the end - but yes, it's a nice tune. Thumps up, mr. Jackson.  Track 15 - Whatever Happens. Ok, that's one weird track. Michael Jackson featuring Santane. Wtf? Well, kudos for doing this, and it actually works, in a sort of absurd way. Not single potential, and not a classic, but it's not embarassing, and as an album filler, it's completely acceptable as a cureosity.   Well, what about the rest of it then? Lead single You Rock My World was never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing - but the track is not bad. I can accept that on the record. The same is not true for the horrible ballads Break Of Dawn, Heaven Can Wait, Butterflies, You Are My Life and Don't Walk Away. One is worse than the next, and every time I just try to listen to them, I start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal. Yes, it's that bad, no really, it's horrible. I. Can't. Stand. These. Songs. Period. There are simply no redeeming qualities for me.  And then the two monstrosities - Privacy and Threatened - that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself. Tabloid Junkie from HIStory actually worked, because it packed a great punch, and well, had not been heart before. Well it had been, it was pretty much the same as Why You Wanna Trip On Me from Dangerous, but still. It worked. Ghosts was a good track of Blood On The Dance Floor. Forget about the movie that was - well, embarassing. But the music was good. These tracks aren't. They sound dated, repetitive, out of place and utterly boring and uninspired. Get over it Jackson, we don't want to hear more about the media nagging you, it's not going to make them go away.   Well, all in all, what do we have ... To take the album from A to Z:  Unbreakable - 6/10 - A fair dance track. Heartbreaker - 6/10 - same. Invincible - 6/10 - same. Break Of Dawn - 0/10 - Horrible R'n'B overproduced. Vomit. Heaven Can Wait - 0/10 - same. You Rock My World - 5/10 - well, at least it sounds new. Butterflies - 0/10 - more vomit. Speechless - 10/10 - the flower in the dirt. One true MJ song. 2000 Watts - 8/10 - Very enjoyable, and stands out tall compared to the rest. You Are My Life - 0/10 - even more vomit. Privacy - 2/10 - Yawn. Repetitive and dated. Don't Walk Away - 0/10 - end of vomit. Cry - 9/10 - beautiful showmanship, Kelly + Jackson works - again. The Lost Children - 6/10 - well, it has potential. Whatever Happens - 7/10 - interesting, and well, refreshing, if somewhat strange. Threatened - 2/10 - same as Privacy, and exactly as boring.  This yields and average about 3.6/10, or 2/5 stars, which actually matches my fealings for this album fairly well. Yes, I'm harsh, but from a man as gifted as Jackson, you just expect more. Quality control next time, please, mr. Jackson.  On the bottom line: Outtakes The Way You Love Me and We've Had Enough showed up on the 2004 Ultimate collection and outranked 2/3 of this album by far. Go figure 
 I agree with J.Boot's review - it is obvious that another reviewer on this page is completely biased. Maybe it was their way of getting 'brownie points' for a better grade. ;) As for the book, the explainations aren't very good, the illustrations confuse the subject, and overall it is a dry, slow read. I think the same regarding the 'Align in the Sand' book, too. The subject matter seems to jump around with little thought to flow, and the overall theme regarding IT/business alignment is a bit too utopian and unrealistic. 
 All during the 1960s, when authors still appeared on The Tonight Show, The Dick Cavett Show, etc, the two authors who had the most exposure and most  proclaimed their "genius" were Norman Mailer and Truman Capote.   Both fizzled miserably.  Their dwindling fame will be filed under  "Celebrity" rather than "Literature."  Mailer is the  better of the two, but he has not worn well 
  Had for not even a month and when used it broke. Would not recommend 
 I listened to the audio book version of this book. At first, it seemed quite refreshing to know men and women were so different that you could explain in your work environment why people behaved like that. However, it just didn't give any solution and keep saying it over and over again in this book can bore anyone.   This book is more like a psychology paper rather than a practical handbook. The person who performed the book makes it more disturbing.  In one word, from this book, you will understand that people are so different that you can't expect others will think like you. Men are more hierachical and women are nice and think all men are equal. My understanding is that even if it is like this, you can only be yourself 
 This comic is terrible, in fact that's doesn't go far enough. The story is rubbish and puts in details that are not supported by the OVA series. The charaters are bland and boring and in some cases the spelling of their  names has been changed.  Adam Warren cannot, no matter how hard he tries  draw otaku manga, he should give up and try something else. And he can't  write neither 
 i would not reccommend this product.  i would rather do chinese arithmetic than put this together again.  it took a long time and i am good at this type of thing.  the unit is ok but not as good as it looks.  hope this was helpfu

 The facts of Pershing's life are interesting: he participated in the Indian Wars, led soldiers in the Spanish American war in Cuba alongside Teddy Roosevelt, was a central figure in the occupation of the Philippines, served as commanding officer in the manhunt for Pancho Villa, and -- of course -- was the commander in chief of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I.  Apparently, he was an extremely capable military man with an eye for detail and unparalleled military discipline.  He overcame an unspeakable personal tragedy -- the death of his wife and daughters in a fire.  Also impressive: from a modest Missouri upbringing, he was entirely self-made.  But a great biography does more than recite facts about its subject.  It brings the reader inside his mind, and gives historical context to his decisions.  In this regard, this book is a failure.  The reader does not come away with the impression that Pershing was a great military strategist, like Lee or MacArthur.  In fact, it is hard to decipher what was Pershing's military philosophy.  Neither does the reader come away with the impression that Pershing's thinking about the great events of his time had any impact on the era's political decisionmakers.  There is only one exception: it is clear that Pershing saw the United States as a full partner with its European allies in World War I, rather than as a mere source of personnel to replenish the dwindling ranks of French and British infintrymen.  This contribution was significant.  The World War I era is one of the most fascinating and under-appreciated in recent Western history.  The war itself was one of the terrible tragedies of all time, and it set the stage for the worldwide economic expansion of the twenties, depressionof the thirties, and the Second World War.  It's too bad that this book sheds so little light on one of the most important figures of that era. 
      A relatively easy read.  The chronology is rather loose and jumps around more than I cared for.  Certain positive issues and programs sponsored by the Vatican are ignored.  Also, some negative situations addressed seems to be a more grabbing at straws to shore the argument, not much meat to them.  Other determining factors were well covered.  It could have been a little more balanced in my opinion.  Not my favorite read on the issue 
 It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company. I have owned this software for about 80 days.  1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice. 2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes. 3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support' 4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device.  In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them.  Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else 
 Virtually everywhere in this book, the author brags about how readable the book is. For one thing, after half a semester of ECON 211 Principles of Microeconomics, this book has not been helpful at all.  Graphs are placed on a page and the author spends two pages explaining the graph. The theory behind all of the paragraphs was designed to baffle instead of to enlighten. While some real-life case studies (Dell's organizational methods) are interesting reads, what the book needs to do more is to talk about applying theories to strategies in real life.  It may be true that I am taking a Principles of Microeconomics course, but in a course where I am expected to understand how to apply theories to problems in the real-world, this book is a long way from being readable or being helpful in a course in micro 
 This was the first go board I ever had, about ten years ago (looks like it's still the same as it was then).  The game of go itself is wonderful, and everyone should learn and teach all their friends.  This equipment, though, is of poor quality and overpriced in relation to that lack of quality.  The board itself is a cheap wood laminate -- I carried mine around in a backpack a few times, and the corners started coming apart.  It's basically plywood, and won't survive ungentle use like a solid piece of wood will.  The stones are cheap plastic things, whereas a basic set of good ceramic/glass stones are not that expensive.  Lastly and most importantly, this go set is *tiny*!  While that does make it more compact, it's very hard to manipulate.  Fingers constantly bump the (very lightweight) stones by accident, it's hard to avoid messing up the board layout, and the whole "feel" of the game is lost 
 I cannot understand why this book got so many good reviews. I'm not saying that if I didn't like it, no one can or should, but I really don't understand. It's so tedious. Every little thing in these unbelievable characters' lives is described to such great length. Unnecessarily so. Why do we need to know all the details about every piece of art work this guy made? A summary would do. And to take soooooo long before getting to the point. It's like half the book was merely background to the reall thing, but why so long?! And the characters don't come alive despite all those details. They don't feel like people, just mouthpieces for views on hysteria and art. No matter what, I just didn't care about any of the characters. And even as a novel of ideas, I think this one would fail. The ideas are not developed, they're described like self-gratification, something you may take from a friend but not someone you don't care about. So, clearly I didn't like this one. I would just like to understand what I missed that made all those others love the book so much 
 Maybe the worst "thriller" I've read in years. The dialogue, characters and plot are at best soap opera material and that's giving it a positive spin. I hope Mr. Hosp is a good lawyer....and we all know what Wm. Shakespeare said about that profession 
 The book does nothing but make a lie of itself. There's no leftwinger that hates America contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you. You can't keep complaining about Michael Moore and Dan Rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as Rush Limbaugh and Dan Flynn. Folks, you cannot complain about the left hating America when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing China and other facist and communist nations to control America's economy and pretty much everything else of it 
 As much as I love Leon's music, I can't enjoy this due to the atrocious sound quality. I recommend getting the self-titled debut or the "Shelter People" instead 
 I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera 
 First of all, I think that anyone out there who is writing books about anti islam are just out there to make money. I would like to go back to what the author stated about the muslim world dictators. The question is who put them in power to eliminate the true values of Islam? Why today Middle East is the target by the oppressors of the New World Order? Who puts these leaders in throne and try to bring Democracy to a muslim world. What would happen if Islamic constitution would establish in western world. It would be a scary scene for that part of the world. Those who are muslims or studied Islam knows that it is a religion of PEACE. The word JIHAD in Islam corresponds to fighting against the DEVIL who resides within all of us which is 90% of JIHAD and the other 10% of JIHAD is self defence. There is no conflict among any religion branch except those power hungry dictators. Comon people lets not have a religious war, we are all the children of ADAM and beleive in ONE GOD. Let us all join together to fight the DEVIL who is here to destroy each individual of us. We must all wake up before it is too late and see what the soldiers of DEVIL are doing to bring ONE WORLD ORDER and to enslave us under the DEVIL government. Peace to you all 
 Susan Sontag disparaged the idea that dis-eases are caused by mental states, and her resolutely taking this position illustrates the great and willing blindness of this talented but dis-eased anti-white racist. She had such a beautiful basket of blossoms to offer, and between their leaves and stems crawled poisonous snakes she could not free herself of because she wasn't willing to look in her own basket. Unfortunately her work is forever tainted with her hatred.  Sad - 
 Where does one draw the line? Why is it ok to tobacco farm? I guess growing cancer doesnt bother anyone? Is it ok that farming destroys the land in a more genteel way than the growth of cities? What you advocate is the theory of slow death, Wendell 
  "Nothing's okay," Westgate Penitentiary inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) says, "I gotta get out."  That's because the sadistic screws are keeping the otherwise tractable inmates down with BRUTE FORCE.  You treat a man like an animal and he turns into one, right?   At least so sayeth the usually reliable director Jules Dassin in this overripe movie about a prison on the edge of explosion.  You see, the bad guys - the inmates - have a backstory, told in a series of flashbacks, that proves they're good guys under the prison grays.  They just got hooked up with bad women who made them do bad things.  Flashbacks don't lie.  They don't necessarily entertain, or keep a movie chugging onward at a comfortable clip, but they don't lie.  The prison officials, on the other hand... the otherwise decent warden is weak and vacillating.  The avuncular doctor drowns his reprehension in brandy, emerging from his alcoholic stupor  periodically to crack wry about the inhumanity of it all.   The baddest good guy is Capt. Munsey (`Sir' to you), Hume Cronyn, an effete sociopath with a blood taste for dishing it out (he seems particularly fond of whips) and a penchant for the insinuating seduction.     I wanted to like it, but as BRUTE FORCE plodded forward, piling melodramatic excess on melodramatic excess, I found myself fighting it.  Fighting the notion that everyone in effective authority was a heartless goon, the ineffective ones were broken (presumably by the ruthless System), and the inmates were misunderstood choirboys.  Despite its good looks, good performances and exciting final scene I had too many "Aw, c'mon" moments to honestly say I liked this movie.     The transfer print is in good condition, and the disk includes a hands-free Stills Pressbook Gallery with a number of behind-the-scene photographs, publicity stills, lobby cards and posters. 
 Gerry Marsden and his Pacemakers are great.  I just want to point out that the double-CD 'Best of' Import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price.  There is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import 
 ...who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange.  I love beef jerky, especially peppered and hot & spicy varieties. But this jerky lacks the chewy-ness that I expect in a quality beef jerky.  This stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy, grainy consistency.  The flavor isn't bad, but after reluctantly finishing the first bag, I can't bring myself to open the second one.  Perhaps I wasn't paying proper attention, but I was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in Brazil.  I would not have purchased it if I had known this 
 Grabbed this in an airport prior to a flight.  I didn't even read the jacket, figured I couldnt go wrong with a biography of an American hero.  The 'author' shamefully makes linkages between Patton and 'a series of civilian and military massacres in Sicily...'  Trapped on a plane for 5hrs, I gave it an honest chance.  I struggled through about 75 pages and had to lay it down.  I dont know if it was the laborious details of family members, the revisionist BS, or a combonation of both.  
 I can see this book really knocking the socks off of a Photoshop neophyte with little to no understanding of image processing fundamentals or color spaces, but if you've ever done anything more complicated than pasting your co-worker's head on a celebrity's body and typing some hilarious text underneath it, there's really nothing worth spending money on here. Mr. Margulis has taken a tiny handful of incredibly rudimentary and well-known retouching techniques and padded them out with a Herculean dose of narcissism in order to make himself sound like some sort of pioneering genius. His tone is grating to an extreme and as others have said, there's probably about ten pages worth of genuinely good information in the entire book.   Yes, Lab mode is there. Yes, it makes certain calculations simpler. Yes Photoshop uses it as its default profile connection space. But guess what, Lab has a great many flaws as well, and these flaws continue to drive the CIE to create successors such as Luv, LCh and xyY. And of course we can't forget about the good old faithful XYZ space which probably deserves to be touted as "the most powerful colorspace" at least as much as Lab does. Why hasn't Mr. Margulis written a book about that?  Probably because he has little to no idea what he's talking about and is just parroting material he's read on various free websites over the years.  Do a Google search on "Lab Color" and/or get yourself a book on color management if you want to learn something other than cheap parlor tricks. Round-tripping your images to Lab and back unnecessarily is one of the best ways to destroy whatever color fidelity they might have had, especially if you take Mr. Margulis' advice and throw half your capture data away just because you want to rebel against convention by disregarding things like easily demonstrable facts. In Mr. Margulis' world, photographers make such perfect exposures every single time that they have no need of higher bit depths or non-destructive editing features. Of course, if this were actually the case, they'd have no need of a book about fixing imperfect exposures, either. 
 The premise for this book is quite simple: "They hate us because we are so wonderful"...for three hundred pages Timmerman sets out to assert that the modern terrorist phonomenon can't be attributed to anything the US has done, but rather is rooted entirely in Islamic jealousy for the success of the West  After all we are perfect; it only makes sense that the jealousy harbored by these Islamic barbarians boiled over into spectacular forms of violence...never mind the violence we have been perpetrating in the Middle East, indeed throughout the planet, for th last half century  The generalizations made about Arabs and Islam could be applied to any culture since every culture has hate, every culture has violence, every culture proports to be "superior" to the rest.   However Timmerman expects us to believe that Islamic hatred is somehow different, somehow more evil, from Western or Jewish hatred.  That blowing up a bus is different than dropping bombs on apartment buildings. That the killing of an Israeli is inherently more evil, more sinful, than the killing of a Palestinian.   After all our killings are justified, we are fighting a war on the terror! What difference does it make if a few (over 10,000 in Iraq and Afghanistan) Moslems get coaght in the cross fire? Remember, Moslems are bred to hate, why should we feel sorry for them? The Palestinians in particular should wake up every day and thank the Israelis for bulldozing their homes, stealing their resources, pushing them off their land and killing their sons and daughters...these barbaric Palestinians should consider themselves blessed just to be in the prescense of an Israeli...these Palestinians should thank Israel for telling them what to do...after all its for their own good, they are Moslems so they are just to stupid and hateful to think for themselves.  Of course the ethnic cleansing of 3 Million Palestinians from their homes in 1948, or the US support of oppressive Pigs in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Indonesia couldn't have anything to do with this hatred talked about by Zimmerman...no this would be simply to difficult to phathom. Everything can be attributed to jealousy and the purely Islamic phonomenon of anti-Semitism (never mind that Arabs speak a semetic language or that the barbarity of Christian anti-Semitism was the cause of the mass migration of Jews to Palestine).   Timmerman asserts that the US came to power purely because of our inherent greatness, forget slavery, forger the Native Americans, forget the exploitation of nearly every country on earth...NO! America played by the rules, we are the chosen nation, we are moral people and thats why we are on top and thats why these hateful Moslems are so jealous of our greatness.  Conveniently, Zimmerman only chooses to focus on the most fanatical Moslems and uses them to guage the faith itself. He neglects to mention that similar words are spoken today in American churches and especially Israeli synagogues.  In Zimmermans world, "hate" can me measured with graphs, pie charts and statistics...somehow Islamic hatred is different than the hatred preached in other parts of the world.    If you are willing to admit America's own mistakes than this book is going to be difficult to believe. I'd give this book 1 star instead of a flat zero because Zimmerman hesitates in calling for the total racial extermination of all Arabs and all Moslems. 
 Although I "listened" to this book on tape, I too was lulled into thinking this is like Jon Kraukauer's "Into Thin Air" -- hardly. It is interesting and at first I didn't realize it was a true story. Balf's book does give a bit of a behind-the-scenes glance at how a trek like this is set up & the importance of the personalities of the people undergoing the trek....but I agree with previous reviewers that this was no page-turner (or let's put it this way, I wasn't sitting in my garage, after coming home from my commute, to stay listening to the tape). If you are a kayaker, maybe this is for you - having trekked in Nepal, I found some of the countryside info of interest, but can't really recommend this book 
 There is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye.  It is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised.  They are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end.  It is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it is getting old.  Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film.  From the opening credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end.  The pauses could be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before, and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best.  It was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills, nothing that would make it stand out from the rest.  The late director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end.  Where did Eye for an Eye go wrong?  I don't think I need to count all the ways for you, but some of the bigger issues that I had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters.  I have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic.  What was Sally Field's job?  I know that is a small detail, but it better highlights my complaint that our central family (the McCanns) were not as developed as I would have liked to have seen.  I had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death, yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed.  Ed Harris literally walked through his character, proving that Field's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion.  The only character worth watching, and was developed briefly, was Kiefer.  He was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end.  Yet, we didn't even know that much about him either (which upset me).  Schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with Eye for an Eye very well, the actors I believe even knew the story and they probably didn't even need to read the script, and the story played it safe from the beginning, but it wasn't what I wanted to see.  I expected film like this to come out during the 80s, not in 1996.  It was pathetic to see name actors like Ed Harris, Sally Field, Phillip Baker Hall, Keith David, and Kiefer Sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan.  Nothing stood out in this film, nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it, and nothing made me feel excited about these actors.  This was a literal "nothing" film.  It lent nothing to the cinematic world except (and I stress this a bit) another peg in a very tired genre known as the "Revenge Thriller".  After watching this film I said to my wife that I thought Sally Field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it, overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements, which made me think of a High School drama production.  It was amateur at best, but she said that is why directors use Sally, because she is known for being overly dramatic.  This is a pure example of a good thing gone badly.  Sally saw success with it once, but as she continues it only creates bad cinema.  There were times during Sally's bigger speeches that I found myself laughing.  I couldn't help myself, but her focus on certain words and clichï¿½ reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike.  The same could be said for Ed Harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn't have to play the outlaying father any further in films.  He was completely wasted in this film.  Was there any emotion with him?  I didn't see any.  Then there was the pitiful contribution by Hall and David that begin with intrigue, but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes.  Also, did Mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clichï¿½?  Urg, his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers.  Again, the only actor worth watching was Kiefer because he not only spoke with evil, but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile.  It was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end.    If I have to talk about the story I think I am just going to go mad myself.  Field over dramatized the entire film, thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer.  Did Kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because Field wanted to see him as evil?  That could have been a great avenue for this film to travel, but alas, ole safe Schlesinger didn't take us down that darker path.  I needed more to develop what Hall and David were doing at the support groups, but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers.  This was yet another dark avenue that was not explored.  I felt as if I saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast, yet we chose to stay on the lighted path.  That, coupled with the poor acting, just created a film that didn't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world.  Overall, in case it wasn't obvious, this wasn't a good movie at all.  In fact, I could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again.  I thought only horror movies had the stated Scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again, but with Eye for an Eye it became obvious that it the "Revenge Thrill" fell into that same pattern.  The only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure, this film did not.  Sally Field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight, while everyone else was forgettable.  The only fun part was watching Jack Bauer play the epitome of evil.  Watch this film for Kiefer, but nothing else.  Skip it!  Grade: * out of **** 
 1. THE BOOK LATE IN ARRIVE  2. RECEIVED THE BOOK INCORRECT  
 I consider this to be a very shoddy piece of literature. A trivialisation of mental illness couled with what is essentially a very boring story. No insights no vision not even well written 
 Despite the cute sounding description, this is not a family movie. The constant undertone of the movie is the sexual tension between the two characters and the utterly absurd emotional reactions of the heroine. The idea of the movie was a good one but once again Hollywood messed it up. We were very disappointed and threw the video out. 
 I was very disappointed in this item. They stickers did not stay in the book. they would fall off or only part of them would stick . would never buy again. it would have been great if they did.concept is very nic 
 As a gay man, I could not possibly come to Terry Eagleton for help or advice. He is like the university professor who throws his hands up in the air and says: "I can't help you gay people become great critics and theorists; go see Judith Butler or Eve Sedgwick!" Eagleton is a white heterosexual male who has ONLY one thing going from him: class analysis. If he didn't have that, he wouldn't have anything. In fact, all he can talk about is class. Look very carefully in Eagleton's texts: gays, women, and minorities do not hold a very high place . . . if they are ever even mentioned at all. I suppose Eagleton would prefer they simply weren't there, clouding up reality. Eagleton must be a very troubled man: not only is he himself a bourgeois academic, Fredric Jameson is superior to him in every way and has said it all (in terms of Marxism), leaving Eagleton with only re-chewed polemics. 
  The reason I have chosen to write this review is that I want express how depraved and offensive I found this book to be.   Zacharias attempts to blame rationalism for immorality.  So, therefore if one was to follow this train of thought to natural conclusion any Philosopher who attempts comtemplate human existence rationally and logically is encouraging immorality. Excuse me??? Any thinker who after honestly engaging in serious contemplation reaches the profound realization that they cannot ethically and honestly subscribe to a belief in God lacks a moral centre.  Excuse me???  The role of the Philosopher is to search for the truth.  It clear, however, that Zachiarias' purpose is to twist the truth to trick people into subscribing to organized religion, specifically Christianity.  This is extremely obvious through his constant use of the term "anti-theist".  Instead of referring to individuals who have decided that they cannot subscribe to a belief in God as Agnostics, Atheists, or nonbelievers.  This is just one method which  Zacharias uses to go out of his way to demean and harass such indicauls by any means he can.   The claim that all nonbelievers lack a moral centre is absolutely insaine and repugnant.  There are plenty of nonbelievers who live exceptionally moral live i.e. Oskar Schindler.  Therefore this is a completely morally bankrupt and dishonest book.    
 This was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said: It was boring 
 A couple of good stories, but the rest were poorly written and not very sexy. Overall a waste of time & money 
 While there are some amusing, interesting parts I was disappointed about the lack of details. The book is written for a non finance audience. There is nothing wrong with that, the title just promises more than what's really in there. 
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 Do not read any further if you don't want to know the climax of this inferior thriller.  Gwyneth Paltrow quickly recovering (after hours of intense natural childbirth labor!!!!!) to go to the garage and find the evidence that Jessica Lange killed her husband and having the strength to belt Lange in the process and looking downright none the worse for wear to boot was totally unbelievable and implausible.  There is no way in real life that this could have occurred!  It takes days for a woman who has undergone natural childbirth to get back on her feet, yet Paltrow is presented as though it was as easy as getting a good night's rest and getting up feeling refreshed, full of vim and vigor!!  Total nonsense.  The performances of the principals, mostly Lange and Paltrow make up for the implausibilities of the script.  Nina Foch does a dandy turn as the granmother but the scene where Lange turns up the cold water in her steam bath is also unbelievable.  In the next scene Foch is revealed to be fine and happy....no pneumonia, no after effects .....nothing!!  This film was one big disappointment and I give it two stars for the acting because the story is pure fluff.  All the actors deserve better here!!  No wonder this film was a "hush" at the box-office....it came and went quickly and I can understand why.  
 I just finished McCarthy's book, The Road, last night and frankly I have to totally agree with a. reader's (Upstate New York) comments.  Indeed, it must be nice to be a recognized, award winning author and get away with anything you write.  When I read the reviews and the flap of the book I was interested enough to buy and read it.  I'll be off to Half Price Books as soon as possible to at least recover some of the money I lost in buying this book.  I was led to believe the story would provide this "awesome" connection between a father and his son.  The conversations between these two are absurd with one and two word sentences.  One "Five Star" reviewer called this a "poignant story of love between father and son."  PLEASE, give me a break, most siblings have more than two word sentences between themselves and their father.  There is no doubt these two are traveling through horrendous times, but McCarthy's description of the terrain is pathetic and redundant.  By the way, how did these guys survive up to the point of when the book begins, supposedly seven or eight years later?  What happen to the people who owned the storm cellar?  Leaving the storm cellar with all of its provisions was preposterous.  How did the father obtain additional bullets after only having one following the shooting?  The bullets he found were the wrong caliber.  Too many gaps and inconsistencies.    When I finally reached the end of the story, I was completely disappointed.  The son had to be the luckiest person on the planet.  It seemed as if McCarthy had reached a deadline with Knopf Publisher and he had to wrap-up the manuscript instead of ending with some sort of a conclusion.  This was the most unrealistic story of a post "unknown disaster" I believe I have ever read.  This book is a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY unless you happen to be someone who reads McCarthy's writings regardless of what he writes.  Maybe the "Five Star" reviewers are running interference for McCarthy's weak excuse for a story.  If I were the CEO of Knopf Publisher, I would be asking a lot of questions about the publishing of this book.   Bottomline, if you are a devoted fan of McCarthy's buy the book and fall in line with all the "Five Star" reviewers; otherwise, don't waste your time or money.  PS:  When did we start spelling couldn't as couldnt 
 I have a theory: Steven Saylor has an identical, yet evil, twin brother named "Spike." I've come to this conclusion after reading the first four chapters of his most recent novel (actually, it's more a collection of inter-related short stories than a novel).  You see the Steven Saylor that we've all come to love wrote the excellent Roma Sub Rosa series. I've purchased and read every book in the series (in fact, I've read them all twice). But after reading the first four chapters of Roma I'm absolutely convinced that Spike Saylor, masquerading as Steven, approached St. Martin's Press and was able to publish this dreck under his brother's name.  I'm astounded at how truly awful this book is: the characters are two-dimensional; they have height and width but no depth whatsoever. The dialogue is embarrassingly bad. While reading this on the subway (in NYC) I found myself physically flinching and had to put the book away in my backpack. I preferred to read the subway adverts instead -- they were more engaging.  If I had Steven's phone number or e-mail address I'd inform him that Spike  has escaped from the asylum and that the police should be notified immediately to stop him from sullying his reputation any further.  MY RECOMMENDATION: skip this turkey 
 This may not be the worst book of Shakespearean criticism ever written, but it ranks way up there among the most pretentious. Frequently spurning coherence, Gross regales the reader with endless, often forced parallels to Shakespeare and Shylock that apparently just pop into his mind from his own readings of other writers, ancient and modern. What this lack of intellectual discipline amounts to is less light shed on the author or central character of "The Merchant of Venice," and more on the reading habits of self-absorbed critic Kenneth Gross. 
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 I have an older Dell computer w/ USB 1.1 so I wanted to upgrade to the faster USB. Despite some of the bad reviews, I thought I'll try my luck and bought this card hoping everything will work fine. Argh... every time I hook up my USB HD, the whole computer crashes. Half of my devices don't work. I am sending this back and will try to use a better brand product 
 This book is neither good contents nor sharp predicts. What is this book?  I think it is just garbage. If you want get more information for your future life and your future business, it is better that you need to read Toefler's work, The Revolutionary Wealth. Naisbitt is not present man any more. He is the past man!!!   
 "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime" didn't just make it on my list of best books of 2005; it made it on my top-ten list of all time. That's why I was so excited to get my hands on "A Spot of Bother" by the same author. Unfortunately, this book didn't come near the interest level or originality of its predecessor.  This book reminded me of a blend of Jonathan Franzen ("The Corrections") and Nick Hornsby ("How to Be Good"), neither of which I enjoyed much. I found "Bother" to be deathly slow and the characters to be frankly uninteresting. I kept hoping one of them would die, just to liven things up, paradoxically speaking.  Though I hate to admit it, I quit reading after 150 pages. 
 this movie sucks.  don't buy it.  the gore looks like spaghetti and it is boring as all hell.  if you like the camera-work of 10 year-olds and people who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag...this movie is for you.   p.s. the infamous "eye gouging" scene can't get much worse...i'm no medical professional...but if a sharp piece of wood penetrates a person's eyeball, shouldn't it bleed...a lot?  oh, i guess not when the shot suddenly switches from a real person into a fake eye closeup that couldn't fool any re-re on the planet.   
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 There ARE some good ideas in here. Unfortunately I just couldn't get past the fact that it is such a thin book with a lot of rehashed stuff. 14.95 is a lot to pay for a magazine, even if some of the ideas are OK. Also, Ms. Stewart doesn't seem to feel the need to test her recipes out first. When following ANY of her recipes, allow a little extra time for recipe adjustment. 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 I probably wouldn't have seen this movie if it hadn't been for Michael Richards (Seinfeld's Kramer). And I would have been right not to do so, because the only thing that makes this film even remotely funny is Richards enormeous talent for physical comedy. He can do the most amazing things with his face and body, and during the first third of the film you get to laugh a lot. But then it gets boring. After that the film tries to tell a story that no one want's to hear. Had it instead concentrated on Richards efforts as the world's worst lawyer, and how he tries to defend the world's dumbest criminal, this film might have been really good. As it is it's hardly worth seeing 
 one of the most important features that should be told is how far down the ground a metal detector can detect both coin size and large items. i'm annoyed with this and many other metal detector's descriptions which refuses to mention this more than important point. i'm shopping for my boyfriend and just because of all the annoyance i may just give up and get him a $10 tie for his birthday. 
 Nevermind patron demons of Law and Chaos, this book clearly proves that Michael Moorcock's muse has abandoned him completely, transmuting our yarn spinner into a sermonizer. How many more Elric stories must we endure in which he's whisked away to another dimension? (At least this time we haven't been slapped with the usual automatic amnesia for the albino at the finish.) All in all, this book is the Wizard of Oz hung with multiverse musings. And war is bad musings. If Elric is Moorcock's best character, vonBek has become his worst. A navel-gazer of the first division with a propensity for inaction, vonBek narrates most of the story to the reader's detriment. Boring, boring, boring.  If you want to maintain your respect and affection for Moorcock, just pretend this one was never written 
 Of course I purchased this without previewing any of the songs because it's "Brad Paisley."  What a mistake!  Really bad song writing! Bad Song Selection for an album! Horrible attempt at humor and I'm wondering if Little Jimmy Dickens will continue to get speech therapy on all of Brad's albums.  I'll be selling my copy of this new CD.....it's junk 
 Actually, I listened to an unabridged audio book, and I thought it was the most painfully slow book I have ever read in my life. It was fairly well-written, but I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. Finally, it did, and the book was still crawling along. I really wasted my money on this one, and the only reason it got two stars rather than one is that it was well-written - but it surely could have used some pacing and plot 
 I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
 I teach an inclusion third grade with about half of my class being special education students.  They are having a hard time understanding multiplication and how it works, so I thought this book would be a great visual!  I was very, very wrong.  I should have listened to the other review on this book.  I agree that the art terminology gets confusing with the math explanations.  I feel the author could have explained the math in more detail and left out the art all together.  I will not even read this book to my class because I know that it will only further confuse them, rather then help them.  So this purchase was a waste of my hard earned money that I thought I was putting towards helping my students.  Don't make the same mistake!   
 Mr. Desmond's book displays near complete inexperience with hroses.  I wonder if he's even ridden a horse before.  Furthermore, I thought the book was actually geared more towards children rather than adults.  He has interesting facts here and there, but that's all I can say about it 
 Personally, I found this workout extremely difficult to follow; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood. After pushing myself to go back to every part I didn't understand, I grew frustrated. Other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition,  as I have obviously tried, but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill, both of which I believe are integral to any workout. And in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output; one shouldn't have to teach themselves the moves.   To a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the "cheesiness" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way.   I don't mean to sound so aggressively negative--I just wish I had been able to learn the moves, because they did look like fun 
 Ann Rule wrote the story of a young couple on a camping trip from Hell! The hero is murdered and the murderer is sexually obsessed with his sexy young wife, Joanne Lindstrom. He captures her, strips and rapes her several times over, and the poor victim is helpless in the woods and grows dependent on the evil "Red Man" She even falls in love with him, and he succeeds in planting his seed in her belly. This sounds like some wild male rape fantasy, but Ms. Rule wrote it, not I. Strange crime story, with highly explicit rape scenes. Highly recommended 
 Being asian myself I am highly insulted by this book! To think there is some mystical book that tells people how they date asians is totaly foolish. Guys, asians are girls just like any other girls and they like the same things. Instead of throwing away your money on this cowpie of a book, buy the girl some flowers. They will go a lot further at winning her heart than anything you will learn from this book 
 Worked OK for about a day and a half, then it would go off every few minutes for no reason. Changed batteries several times, to no avail. Changed position in case squirrels or cats triggered it. Moved it from place to place, even watched the scene, and still sounded the alarm for no reason. This is a piece of junk that will drive your dog crazy. !!! AVOID !! 
 This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book!  They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book...  What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be 
 and that's what we got....the bird again.  Slowly paced, this story is mildly entertaining. I expected a bigger bang than what was given at the end...instead we see a blurred mythical big bird through water... It will keep your interest...but you will feel cheated by the end for wasting your time.   Rent, don't buy 
 I bought the 688 for its price and Logitech name. Customer service was good. I bought it in April 2006 so I have 9 months of marginal satisfactory experience with the device. Took me 4 hours to program, and I needed their help. Same problem with CD as others have reported. Remote does not hold programming, and it is too much trouble to reprogram. Worked well for a while now works spasmodically. Some times I have to resort to the cable remote or the remotes for devices to get desired operation. Battery life is poor. I have had very good results with Logitech support. They would send me a updated file for me to install.  However, I wish I had spent more and gotten one with rechargable batteries and easier to read and operate controls 
 This album was not as i expected it to be... i read all the great reviews and sort of anticipated a better quality album... or rather, something more intricate, more creative. It just sounds so repetitive. I am a huge fan of instrumental rock, godspeed! you black emperor is a great orchestral rock group for example, and mum, sigur ros, and the album leaf are all great examples. Tristeza is not for me, i just dont believe that the instruments used in the music are perfect for instrumental rock... because theres no variety, and you expect the same thing over and over again. Its slow and pretty boring.   Doesn't fit my taste 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 As much as I like Paul Newman, this movie is very disappointing once you've seen the far-superior film "Day One".  The portrayal of Oppenheimer and Groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people.  The movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the Manhatten project.  Be sure to see "Day One" if you are interested in this, and give this film a miss 
 Written by two exceptional C++ gurus, I had expected more from this book, but came out disappointed because this book merely points out proper C++ programming as recommended from other books. This book is severly lacking in details and examples. So if you have read Sutter's other books (Exceptional C++, More Exceptional C++, and Exceptional C++ Style) and Meyers' books (Effective C++ and More Effective C++), then you will find hardly any new information here. But if you haven't read those books or if you are a new C++ programmer, then this book might still disappoint you because, as I mentioned earlier, this book often only points out good coding pratices but is short of details. Save your money, really. Borrow this book from a friend or library and photocopy the pages on "Summary of summaries" as a sort of pocket guide. Major disappointment.  Updated (Aug 8, 05): Whenever you have an author writing apologetics for his book, you know the book is in trouble. The main problem is that this book's two authors lack a strong justification to write a completely new book. Information found in this book is re-hash from elsewhere. It would have been better if the so-called "standards" found in this book be merely summarised into a concise list on the web, with references. Sorry, I am still unconvinced about this book. 
 This book is summarized in a single sentence "be a good teacher".  All the supporting comments should only take up a paragraph - not a  book.  And even then, every thing in the book is self evident and not really needed to be written down. The only people that should be interested in this are those in administration - for some obscure reason they seem to like rhetoric - then again - they are also usually diametrically opposed to the best interests of students and teachers 
 Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters.   The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
 This is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic.  I hadn't read the book before seeing the movie.  The film stunk.  A few years later, I read the book and was enchanted.  I did not make the connection that this was the same story until I saw the film again on late night tv.  I was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen.  Then, I realized what movie it was.  I tried to sit through it.  I just couldn't.  The monster should have eaten the film 
 DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!! I HAVENT EVEN DROPPED MY PHONE OR HIT IT AGAINST ANYTHING AND ITS CRACKING ON ALL CORNERS....... 
 Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
 Marcus Borg may be the most reasonable member of the Jesus Seminar. His books on the "historical Jesus," while I think deeply mistaken (as I explain in my book, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could), do demonstrate intelligence, learning, and often worthwhile insight into one of the traditions he compares in this book. Since he does not claim to be a Buddha scholar, it might seem reasonable to cut him some slack. After all, many of the quotes he gives from Jesus and Buddha do sound similiar. And there is no denying either the charm of Borg's gentle approach, or of many of the quotes themselves.   However, Borg's approach is amateurish and naive, making his conclusions deeply misleading.   To begin with, Borg stacks the deck. He does not compare Buddha's teachings on the evils of making love to one's wife (in the sutra called "Defeat") with similar passages from Jesus, or Jesus' confrontations with political critics with similar problems encountered by Buddha, because such parallels do not exist. Borg only selects points that enhance his argument. But Borg admits that, so perhaps we can let it slide.   More seriously, really Borg does not compare Jesus and Buddha at all. He compares a whittled-down selection of Jesus sayings, written within a few short years of the Master's life, with a vast library of Buddha material written by all kinds of people over several hundred years. At one point he says, "One might even say that becoming a bodhisattva is the goal of the fully developed Christian life." Never mind that this Mahayana concept only appeared half a millennia after Buddha! Such comparisons are worse than meaningless. If I sifted 150 years of Marxist tradition, I could easily find sayings that parallel passages in the Gospels -- but setting them side by side would not mean that the real Marx taught his disciples to turn the other cheek.   Why does Borg not compare the historical Jesus to the historical Buddha? The real reason, aside from the fact that he is admittedly an "amateur" on Buddha, may be that our earliest sources are too remote from Siddhartha to be sure what he was like. In the Dharmapadda, Buddha appears as a kind, gentle thinker like the present Dalai Lama. In other sutras, he is a hippy who leaves home in search of a better commune. Elsewhere he brags like the vain Bagwan Rajneesh: "I am the Tathagata, the teacher of gods and men, omniscient and endowed with all powers." The various Buddha materials do not come from the same century, let alone the same man. Borg is trying to clap pretty solid historical materials (Jesus in the Gospels) against empty air (sutras that do not in fact come from Buddha at all).   The critic who replies that the ministry of Buddha was longer, so more materials would be available for his life, is just missing the point. After a few centuries of oral tradition and free creation of new sutras, in a culture that did not (like the Jews or Chinese) emphasize historicity, it is hard to figure out from the resulting libaries of material what Buddha actually said, or even was. The same is simply not the case with 1st Century writings by Jewish followers of Jesus, written within the natural life-spans of his first disciples, that show strong internal and external markings of basic historical accuracy. (As even the JS often admits.)   Thirdly, some of the parallels here seem to owe more to similarity of wording than intent. While the Gospel may call a Christian to "hate" his family in the sense of putting God first, Jesus' early disciples do not seem to have left spouse or offspring, as Buddha taught his disciples to do. By "salvation" Buddha means freedom from rebirth, while Jesus means a new birth from Heaven.   What is left of these parallels? Probably "compassion" was important both to Jesus and to Buddha. But from the 1st Century, Christians have not only admitted, but insisted, that moral truth, what C. S. Lewis called the "tao" (following Confucius), is universal. Of course Buddha taught kindness; what else would anyone with a conscience teach? But such a beautiful source of Buddhist compassion as the Dharmapadda contains no hint that Buddha did any miracles. There is little historical evidence that he was a "person of the spirit" in that sense.  Several reviewers say this book is not for scholars. Actually, some of the quotes in it may intrigue anyone. But no one with integrity, scholar or layman, should read too much into such forced parallels.   Marcus Borg ought to know better. His arguments about  "people of the spirit" should rest on serious scholarship. In a sense, though, Borg does truth a service, by showing how far afield one needs to go to find parallels to the Gospel story, and how weak those parallels prove, when tested critically. 
 I have heard that this story condones killing anyone that does not want to be converted to Christianity, or at least the video game 'Left Behind' does. This kind of stuff is not Christianity. This is not what Jesus did to those that were not interested in him 'converting' them- he forgave everyone and loved everyone unconditionally 
 Galbraith's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure.  His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery.  In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience.  The book really needs to go back to an editor 
 Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.  This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.    Brian DeDentro (Rhode Island College 
 The fan is so weak, it makes the product useless. It may be able to cool a small flea. Perhaps an ant. Maybe a centimenter of human skin. Don't waste your money 
 A beautiful song. But, the remix was a disappointment. I thought I was getting the original version. I should have read the fine print. This is the first time I ordered anything from Amazon, so I suppose I learned a lesson 
 If you think H.I.M. are a bunch of MTV goth posers and real goth music is Christian Death, Paradise Lost, Type O Negative, My Dying Bride, or Candlemass click "yes".  If you think that H.I.M. are "da freekin bestest gawth band eva!!!!!" along with Evanescence and My Chemical Romance and those awesome bands are posers click "no" 
 Sorry for the length of the review, but don't make the same mistake I did by buying this book.  When I buy a book, I buy it for its content, which I assume is accurate, complete, timely and written by authors I trust and respect. The content of this book is neither accurate nor complete, doesn't cover the major additions to Excel 2003 and appears to have been updated solely by a new author unknown in the Excel developer community.  If I want support, I'll ask my questions in the Excel newsgroups, where I'm confident they'll be answered by someone who actually knows Excel and uses it daily.  I've had the 2002 version of this book sitting on my desk for a year or so and I find myself regularly refering to it. For me, the first half of the book containing the narrative about VBA is the best bit and much more useful than the object model listing in the appendices. When I read (on Amazon.co.uk) that the appendices were now downloadable and had been replaced by more than 400 pages of new material, I immediately ordered this update. I was expecting lots more of the same information-packed writing I'd enjoyed in the 2002 version, covering the topics mentioned above, such as "Object-oreinted theory and VBA", "How to use VB6 and VB.NET" and "Advanced error handling and debugging methods". All great stuff!  Unfortunately, NONE of that is actually in the book! The object model appendices have NOT been removed, are NOT downloadable or searchable and have NOT been replaced by new material! I can only think that the 'Editorial Reviews' on this page were written from an initial outline that the authors didn't deliver.  Already disappointed by it not matching the sales patter, I began to read the book, only to find that the four authors of the 2002 version (Bovey, Bullen, Green and Rosenberg) didn't actually contribute to this update! The new author, Kimmel, seems to have done the update by himself - and it shows!  As far as I can see, there are three new chapters. The first is a totally impenetrable and theoretical one about Objects, interfaces, polymorphism, inheritance and lots of other jibberish - with nothing relating that to VBA or how we might use it. The second is a basic chapter about debugging and testing (certainly not the "Advanced debugging and error handling techniques" promised). The other new chapter is about XML, which mostly repeats the old material in the "Excel and the Internet" chapter, says that Excel 2003 and can now open and save xml files (with File > Open), but completely omits anything about mapping XML elements to cells using the new 'XML Source' task pane! Those three chapters have been added without increasing the page count much, so the rest of the chapters have been 'edited' to make room - often by deleting those little bits of information essential to applying the concepts to our own code. His edits also included removing all the variable naming conventions from the example code!  Kimmel has also restructured the book, so instead of the 'gradual increase in complexity' approach of the 2002 version, he's put all the 'theoretical' chapters up front - so we learn about writing userforms, database access, the windows API etc before we learn how to open a workbook or select a range! I can only think that C. Walker's review was about the 2002 version, because his comment of "with every chapter the level of learning increases" certainly doesn't apply in my opinion.  The biggest problem with this edition, though, is that Kimmel obviously knows nothing about Excel. There are so many errors, inaccuracies and incompleteness that I'm amazed it passed the editing stage.  Surely anyone can spot the error in his tip of closing addins from the Immediate window using the command:   AddinWorkbooks("TheAddin.xls").Close  I guess he didn't know whether to use the Addins or Workbooks collections, so used both! And wouldn't that be an 'xla' extension?  Bottom line: Do NOT buy this book. If you have the 2002 version, there's nothing extra worth having, and lots of new errors to stumble over. If you don't have the 2002 version, buy that version instead of this. Everything in it applies equally to Excel 2003, and the biggest new additions in Excel 2003 (XML Mapping and the VB.NET integration) aren't mentioned in this version anyway.    And if you're like me and want to read more from the original four authors, a new book by them has just appeared on Amazon.com - Professional Excel Development - due out in February. I can't wait 
 Although I was thrilled to see the entire Oz collection together at last, I was terribly disappointed with this edition.The print is too small and the book seems to be "all work and no play." I mean that it is so intent on getting the stories together that there is no time for little things that make children's books good, i.e. pictures. The binding is rather cheap looking and the page quality is see through.Save your money and buy a good hardcover collection 
 What you think from the summary the plot is makes only about 15% of the book. The rest is enornous number of parallel plots (overloaded with useless details) very loosely related to the main plot. Also this book doesn't belong to Sci-Fi, SCIENCE is not present here. The closer to the end the more implausible it gets 
 I watched this movie all the way through only because I paid $22.00 plus shipping and felt I should give it every chance to redeem itself. It is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings I would give it -10!! Rated "R" for what? Language? Adult content? I have seen Disney films more deserving of the "R" rating. This movie was silly, definitely not entertaining in any way and I threw it in the same bucket I put my dog's crap in when I clean up the yard. I am a Chris Isaak fan, have all his CDs and went to his concert on December 9. The fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately, even his music. I did not find the film offensive, I enjoy hard core porn. I feel this is a rip off, poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone!!! 
 Whether you view Cons as "conservatives" or as "con artists", this book offers the same tired platitudes for fixing their America - push more and more market risk onto the poor and give corporations greater privileges and more tax dollars.  It's just not worth the time 
 Having read several novels by this author, and having been delighted with his characteristic use of language, I picked up this novel from the library.  To say I was disappointed doesn't begin to describe the boredom I suffered while forcing myself to finish this book. Far too many pages are taken up with philosophical dialogue between characters whose voices are nigh indistinguishable.  While I enjoy improbable stories, deus ex machina plot twists remain distasteful to me.   If you're still interested in this book, get it from the library before you invest.  
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 This book has interesting views of Scott Peterson. I think that it was kind of cheesy to write a book about him though. I think it was important for someone on his side to tell the story though. I just wonder about some of the things that supposedly happened. Scott Peterson is a freak 
 If you are reading these in order, this one is anticlimatic! you know that they are going to be together and the back story is horrible.  I really enjoyed the first 3, but the stories are becoming so much the same that I am giving up on this series!  I enjoyed sherrilyn kenyon's series so much more (which is also a little repetitve), but better written.  Christine really needed an editor to get rid of the same old statements over and over again AND to speed up the boo 
 I couldn't finish this book and I'm not sure if the problem is in the writing or in the editing.  At times the author seems to take these great leaps based on one or two anecdotes from his life and it is just not convincing.  There are some interesting details here and there but for me, it was just too rambling and all over the map.  
 I received my order and was very dissapointed.  The skin tones online are deceiving.  I ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy.  Doesn't blend well with skin.  Suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone 
 This repeats the same exact information througout the book.  Never really saying anyting new.  The information is very basic.  Only of use to you if you have no concept of music and sound.  I would not recommend this book to  anyone 
 Poor singers, annoying sound effects in what some people call songs. Their voices are just auful at times, like a sqeaky old granma. God I hate this album 
  As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 I read this book as it was a suggestion from my book group. I adore vanilla. Most likely more than the average person. However, the author of this book REALLY REALLY REALLY loves vanilla. More than I think it humanly possible. Patricia Rain's pacing is terrible, she opens the book with a list of incorrect facts in an effort to "trick" the reader and then show off her smarts. I think the person who would buy this book already knows such basics as "vanilla beans are green, not brown when they are growing" so her trickery just comes off odd. If you really want a book that is badly written, but tells you everything you could possibly ever need or want to know about vanilla, then this is the book for you! If you're looking for an interesting read about the cultural history of a spice, I'd skip this one 
 I'm sick of this song!! It's overplayed...Can you people stop loving Green Day so much. They suck. 
 I bought this book hoping to find some new exercises that would help me expand my skills.  But I found most of them too basic for my tastes.  This book might be good for people who are just learning to flex their writing muscle.  But for anyone who has been writing for a few years, don't bother 
 I have heard this CD (25 Romantic Classics). The main problem in the 25 tracks is that most of them are not pure romantic music. The Air on G string could not be classified as "Romantic" because the general theme is closer  to  tragic than romantic. The same thing goes for Vivaldi's allegro. The  Performance of Mozart's Piano concerto in A made by the poor "Israel Chamber Orchestra"  is weak, and i am still wondering of putting this performance in the CD Although  There are  dozens of great performances for Mozrat's piano concertos. The performance of Beethoven's Fur Elise is quite poor. it went faster than the usual, in addition to extreme use of the sustaining pedal. I Believe that any amateur could perform it better than the soloist here. I wonder why t Chopin's prelude no.7 is in such a CD, its quite out of any conceivable thematic context in addition to being to short. preludes such  No.6 (the Tolling Bells) and No.15 (Raindrops) could have been much better for such a CD of romantic music. Add to that, the  pianist didn't use the tempo rubato in playing this piece. So the semi-romantic piece was totally destroyed. The rest of the tracks too humble for the serious critic. I don't believe that this CD makes any addition to any classical collection 
 This book glorifies a toddler who squishes strawberries in the supermarket, throws groceries out which causes patrons to slip, opens boxes of cereal and dumps them on the floor..... Not a wise choice 
 I bought this book on a whim since my cousins & I are at the age where we are getting married.  This book may be useful if your family has been in this country for several generations or if you are not of Chinese ancestry.   As a 1st generation American Born Chinese, I was hoping to ready more  about the do's & don'ts - (i.e. the tea set used to serve tea for the  new in-laws must be purchased by the bride, her family, or a friend.)   Also, in the section about Chinese wedding banquets, she states that 'in  China, 4 is a lucky number'.  BAD MISTAKE.  In some dialects, the  pronunciation of the word four sounds like the Chinese pronunciation of  DEATH.  Eight is the luckiest number.  I do Not recommend this book because  of some mistakes and lack of interesting information 
 I can't believe how wild, petty, and such a brood Marcus is.  The new earl is such a child in character that I got bored after a hundred pages and threw the book away.  This obviously was not thought out by the author.  This is not a romance,  but a calamity. Boo! Boo! on the author.  This is terrible writing.  I do not recommend this book 
 The "Two New Sciences" are required study at Thomas Aquinas College in California. I and a number of students have this paperback edition. The pages come loose and just keep coming loose as you study the propositions.  Even being very careful with the book, the pages still keep coming out.  I have heard a number of other people complain of this same problem.    Pretty much everyone here knows that the paperback edition falls apart and they only buy it since it is cheaper than the hardback.  I have no idea how the pages hold up on the hardback edition, but I hear that it is better than with the paperback.  So unless you intend to put it in a display case and read it from there, I urge you to skip the paperback version and get the hardback or get another publishing entirely (if such exists) until Wall & Emerson gets their act together and republishes this book, fixing the problem.  I rate two stars only because of the greatness of the text itself, subtracting three for the horrible binding.  
 I love "SPY vs SPY", and so do my kids. I bought this version of The Metamorphosis as I saw it advertised and thought it could be an entertaining illumination of Kafka's novel. I had read Kafka's Metamorphosis in the distant past in Spanish, translated from the German by Borges (I gave it away years ago and wish now I could retrieve a copy). At that time I realized it was very funny and thought it strange people currently consider it a nightmarish tale. A recent review of a biography of Kafka confirmed to me, two decades later, that in fact it WAS comedy and meant to be so by Kafka an his clique of writer buddies. I had started reading the English translation to my twin 8-yr-olds with the comic zest it deserves. I switched to this comicbook version halfway but found it impossible to overcome the gloomy, darkened tragic flavor of the obviously tragic comicbook version. I have tried now to encourage my boys to make a truly comic version of The Metamorphosis in comicbook form with bright colors, especially metallic for the salesman-turned-bug. Such a version would do justice to The Metamorphosis 
 **Disclaimer**  My review is of the abridged audio version.  Most of the time I can find something redeeming about a book.  But there are exceptions . . .  This book really re-defined "bad" in a whole new way.  Histrionic women that give us girls a bad name, completely unbelieveable actions by the characters, phony affairs, odd revenge motives . . . the list is unending.  And let's not forget the dead bat on the bed as an aphrodisiac?????  Suspense is great, but it needs to be based on some plane of reality.  (Anyone believe that the Senator wouldn't have requested at least one photo of the supposed "affair" before buying the whole thing, hook, line and sinker?)  Romance is great, but it needs to be believable between the characters. (Barbara and the villain?  Even the lead couple - what is the basis?)  Women are emotional (hey, we could even be described as mercurial at times), but most of the time we need some provocation before going stark raving crazy and falling into the arms of the nearest available good-or-evil stud muffin.  (Apparently none of the women in this book ever matured past Madison, the 15 year old.)  So, fellow readers . . . pretend this book is a waterfall, pretend it's a psychotic good-guy-gone-bad, pretend it's a dead bat on your bed . . . STAY AWAY 
 I love a good, fun, guilty pleasure type read as good as the next woman but this book had no point.  It was just silly.  It is fun to read books with these funny and extravagant characters when something actually happens.  This was more of a childish running commentary.  I got to the end and just wondered why even waste time writing something like this?  
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

   This has to be THE WORST western movie ever. I do believe the actors that appeared in this movie did it just to have the chance to work together, because honestly I can't find a logical reason why someone like Gene Hackman would actually appear in such a ridiculous flick. Follow my advice on this one DO NOT BUY 
 I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans 
 Good book on deal structure, but if you want a valuation number, check out "Unlocking the Value of Your Business" 
 After much window shopping (research) I bought this chair two weeks ago and yesterday the thing fell apart while I was leaning back and watching a movie on my comp.  Here is the problem, the back support is connected to the seat only by the two handle bars which are made of plastic. While I was leaning back, one of the handles literally cracked open at the junctions where the bottom (right side) two screws are. I fell back wards head first but luckily, my floor is carpetted and I did not hurt myself that much.   The manufacturer rates this chair as big and tall (upto 250 pounds) and for 5 hours of daily usage. I weigh around 210 and I had been sitting on it for less than an hour when the incident happened.  I am surely hoping to get my money back but the rest of you big and tall people beware 
 I was excited to find this book and enjoyed it as much as the other reviewers seemed to--until several chapters into it the author began making gratuitous, snide political remarks. I ignored the first of them, but they soon became so distracting I put the book aside in disgust. If I had wanted to read political commentary, that's what I would have bought. I would have accepted her broad interpretation of what comprises a "Quirky History" had she not used it as a platform for hurling insults. Her editor, if she had one, should have striken them out. 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 What in the world are these other reviewers talking about. Must be the author reviewing her own work or her friends. This book just talked about basic training. it gave no special survival tactics or any way of succeeding more than the other recruits. I found nothing at all special about this book 
 I read this book not too long ago and found that the common theme of it was to never actually use science to prove anything. It would use some laws while ignoring others that are needed to complete a formula in order to say why some things couldn't be. It's not hard to "disprove" something when you don't take into account all information needed. The author would also use vague descriptions of certain concepts in order to promote an idea, problem being that the author either failed to understand what they were saying or did this on purpose to mislead. And when the author couldn't "disprove" something even with false interpretations of science the author would simply say that it didn't exist. The book uses science loosely, but never correctly and relies more on using analogies that don't really apply to the topics covered in this book. Avoid this book if you are looking for a scientific explanation for creationism or even a young earth, any science it uses is warped and relies on the reader not understanding true science. Read a science text book on biology, geology, etc if you truly want to understand Gods creations. Once you understand the science you will realize how amazing Gods creations truly are. They are not simple, they are remarkably complex and adaptable 
 Aren't people getting bored and burned out with this stuff? Its the same old mythology being re-hashed in another "magickal" book! It gets very old very fast 
    This book was disappointing. I had anticipated that the author would have explained what made her leave her live-in boyfriend, sell her apartment, 2 cars and shop in Switzerland to move to Kenya in pursuit of a relationship with a Masai warrior she'd barely met and with whom she did not share a common language. Her only explanation was that she was in love with "her Masai." At 27 she should have recognized the difference between animal lust and true love. (She admitted that she liked him better in only a loincloth with his hair, face and chest dyed red than she did when he was in shirt, jeans and sneakers.)    She gives few details other than an itenerary of their trips into towns to take care of business. Her most-detailed descriptions are of her episodes of vomiting and diarrhea during bouts of malaria and hepatitis. Her only mention of  the cutting rituals to inflict decorative scarring is when she's on vacation in Switzerland and the cuts become infected with scabies.    She complains of being used by others while she contantly relies on the missionary priest to fix her broken-down car.    Her complaints are those of all young women who followed a school-girl-like crush to a marriage and parenthood for which they were ill prepared. She does not adequately describe the uniqueness of her situation. I'm sure her time in Africa must have been interesting, but that's not conveyed in the book. At first I thought this was the fault of the translation, but the book only received mediocre reviews at the German Amazon site 
 I have never felt that I could participate well in guided visualizations.  That is exactly what this CD is.  If you visualize well and can imgaine well and summon raw emotions at someone else's mere suggestion, this may work well for you.  But it doesn't for me.  It just feels silly and like a waste of my time and money.  This is not my modality.  
 Do you have expensive tastes?  Are you rich?  Childless?  If so, then this cookbook is for you!  I've never even heard of some of these ingredients and the ones that weren't too expensive are nothing that my kids would eat.  In fact, I couldn't find a single thing that my kids would eat, and I don't think the average kid would either.  I think most of these recipes are something only an adult would appreciate.  Well, I guess I can't say that my kids wouldn't like ANYTHING out of this book.  They'd probably like a couple of the dessert recipes.  Check this out from your local library first.  I'm glad I did 
 I find the book lacking in detail for such a large book. He starts on a topic but there is no depth to it. For instance, I wanted to download and store images on the computer. The explaination was very shallow and basic with no real examples and recommendations. It seems to be a volume of very basic stuff on all the digital topics. I take exception with it being called a "Complete Guide". It was recommended in a review and my fault for not previewing it at a bookstore myself before purchase. 
 Your Love by Laura Branigan is the reason that I bought this CD.  It is the only reason that I've kept it all of these years.  Her immense vocals can knock down walls at one second and caress your heart the next.  One of the, if not the most overlooked vocalists ever.  Spanish Harlem by Ben E. King, of course, is another great song but you don't need to by this soundtrack for it.  The rest of the CD is throw away.  But for the Laura Branigan song alone it's worth the money.  It's the only reason I gave this album two stars!  If Atlantic Records ever releases a box set for her, or remasters her albums with this song on either, this CD will be turned in to a used CD store "Pronto!" 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 I read Diana Palmer for a easy no brains love story this was not it. To many plots and relationships going on and not enough on the main couple. I give it 2 stars because its Diana Palmer 
 Who knows why Ruelle felt compelled to write this book?  He makes a lot of sweeping statements about fields he doesn't have a mastery over.  Only  tangentially does he bring in chaos, and he doesn't bother staying on any  point long enough to add any insight on any of the issues presented.  It's  such a weak book that it doesn't even have "brainstorming value"  -- the collection of ideas is limited in breadth and depth.  Perhaps in  1991 it was fashionable to come up with books like this; having read it in  1999, I found little of value 
 I rented this movie at Blockbuster, too. The cover does not even remotely depict anything in the movie. Think very very bad soft porn with a lead actress always hiding her (overweight?) midsection. I cannot say how lame this was. For something much better acted and sweeter, try "Imagine Me and You" or "Saving Face". If you like spoof comedy, try "D.E.B.S." 
 If you feel a burning desire to read this, then I would recommend borrowing it from the library or a friend, but certainly not buying it. I had read another book by this author that I was also unimpressed by, but the title of this novel caught my eye. However, don't be fooled - the references to Nancy Drew are to the book titles or minuscule details. For lack of a better word, this book is lame. The plot is practically nonexistent, and the main character is not sympathetic. The ending is absolutely ridiculous and comes out of nowhere - which should not have come as a surprise seeing as the whole book was strung together by seemingly irrelevant events that ended in quite possibly the dumbest and most unbelievable finish ever. Don't waste your money or time.  
 I liked this book because it makes a good showing on my shelf. People at my house say "Akmed, you are a coffee chemist?" I say, "yes, everything coffee does for me this book can undo. Ever drank too much  coffee and can't sleep? This book solves that problem! Sleep for days after  reading this book! I did. And you can too." One of my friends borrowed  the book just before she quit coffee and died of severe depression. I'm not  saying she read the book, but carrying it around seem to have the same  effect. I hope everyone with too much time and energy will read this book,  as they too will suffer a lingering malaise 
 Received this book and found the inside to contain a book on diet and nutrition. Based on my understanding of the description, the contents would have covered Assertiveness training for women.   Stange 
 I completely agree with the reviewer who deemed this novel "overkill" with regards to the puppy mill preaching.  Those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this book and read it are already well aware of the puppy mill industry.  This choir member did not appreciate being preached at for 45 pages of a novel that would have been better spent with more plot development.  Also, I got a little weary of all the explanations of dog training and AKC show terms and slang.  Again, those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this novel already know what UDX, CDX and OFA stand for.  Readers interested enough in dogs to pick up this book but do not know what BOB stands for, what "finishing" a dog means, or what an Open class is would probably take the time to find out.  I would have preferred a Patrick O'Brian appraoch in regards to the terms and slang.  Just throw 'em out there for those of us who know, and pique the interest of those that don't.  The way it turned out, however, is that one hundred and fifty pages of a 256 page novel were all either dog show terms explained, or extolling the evils of the puppy mill industry.  I am a bit amazed that Ms. Conant does not say anything at all about the average "backyard breeder" who knows nothing of breeding dogs and wants to do it simply because his dog has papers, who do just as much damage to a breed as puppy mills, if not more.  Go figure.  I have two other Susan Conant Dog Lover's Mysteries to read, and after this first, I am a little leery of even opening the covers 
 This book appeared to be fashionable because it was authored by the name, Gary Hart. Having read just about everything on Thomas Jefferson, I rushed out to get this one. After reading it, I was disappointed. It was long on explaining Mr.Hart's personal opinions and short on explaining Thomas Jefferson's philosophy behind his idea of "ward republics". I have to tell you, I got more information and enjoyment out of another book about Jefferson's philosophy, including a section on ward republics, that pre-dates this book that I read a couple of years ago called "West Point: Character Leadership...Thomas Jefferson" by Norman Thomas Remick 
 IT sucked because I couldnt figure out the screen it is really big so you cant relly hide it any where and you cant drop it because it will break really easily Trust ME I KNO 
 I like the majority of William C. Davis works but this work is not a good effort. It does not even begin to focus on the Natchez trace, does not adequately describe the impact of the city of Natchez on the early Southern frontier, ignores the separateness that characterized early southwestern America and barely touches on the existence of another road, the Military Road from Charleston to Mobile to New Orleans that had just as much impact on the settlement and development of this portion of the early southwestern United States. Whew, that was a mouthful!  Unfortunately, these are the high points of this book. The book is poorly written, disorganized and follows no chronological sequence. If you are interested in the fascinating history of early Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, consider The Old Southwest, 1795-1830 by Thomas D. Clark and John D. W. Guice. It appears that many passages of Davis' book are lifted directly from it. 
 The last chapter of this book is informative and interesting on why people prefer certain colors. This information is helpful to know how to choose colors for interior/exterior decorating, art work, and understanding  people. The rest of the book deals with metaphysics and psycho-babble 
 I used to geocache and so I read this book with interest. The information is misleading ("GPSr: Slang of a GPS receiver." An initialism is hardly "slang") to slightly dangerous (the author recommends turning off the GPS for most of your trek to "save batteries." Instead of losing your breadcrumb trail back to your camp or car, why not just carry spare batteries?).  It appeared to me that the author had never really spent much time geocaching. Take his advice with a grain of salt 
 Arthur Rowe is a graying middle-aged man who visits a parish carnival. He tries the fortune teller and unknowingly mentions a coded question. He is told to guess the weight of the cake raffle as "four pounds eight and a half ounces"! Rowe won this prize, but there was some question about it. Back at his apartment he has a piece of cake. Then a bomb falls and destroys his apartment (war time London). The new tenant went to the hospital. Rowe goes to a Private Inquirer to find out about this new tenant, and why he put a drug in Rowe's tea. Next Rowe goes to track down the fortune teller, and visits the lobbying group called the "Free Mothers". Hilfe takes him to a seance where somebody is stabbed. Rowe makes his escape before the police arrive. [This is followed by pages of reminiscing about Rowe's boyhood. It pads the story, and displays Greene's literary prowess. A film would cut it all out to simplify the story.] Pages tell of life in wartime London under the bombs.  The story continues with an undercover operative fooling Rowe into taking a suitcase to a hotel room. ["No good deed ever goes unpunished."] Johns explains the "Ministry of Fear" as the method of gathering dirt on important people then threatening them with exposure if they don't cooperate. [SOP for the Secret Services.] Could a witness disappear into a private asylum (Book Two)? Rowe manages to escape from the asylum, and goes to the police. His information matches what is known. The police raid the private asylum and find 3 dead men. They cannot find the spool of microfilm with the secret papers. They find the buttons and shoes from Jones, the private inquirer, but nothing else. Its easy to get rid of a body in war time. It all ends well: the secret microfilm is recovered, and Arthur is happy.  What could Green have been thinking? The drama about a secret spy ring is masked by the psychological musings of Arthur. The much better "The Third Man" is an improved version of this story, all the dull parts were omitted. Was this written for domestic propaganda? Greene worked for British Intelligence during the war, he could have written a better story. 
 Blessed are the peacemakers Love thy enemies The meek will inherit the earth. It will be easier for a camel to walk thorough the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into heaven. These arent direct quotes but are some ideas expressed by Jesus Christ, the same man this hypocrite claims to follow. To say that George Bush is a faithful man is so blatantly stupid. Its sad that people in this country can be subdued into believing that this man is a Christian. It seems to me that people who claim themselves to be religious have chosen nationalism over religion. If it makes you feel better to vote for someone who has murdered thousands and thousands of people by saying he is a christian, fine, answer to it when you die 
 Two of the greatest funny men in history with some of the most memorable comedy skits ruined by the laugh track!! 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 "THEY CAME TO EARTH MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO TO SPREAD THE POISON OF HATRED, WAR AND CATASTOPHE...  Do you REALLY want to know who "they" are?  May I recommend:  http://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/CDA14.htm 
 This book sucks so bad.  All of the redundant crap that everyone makes  kids read about the Holocaust is so depressing.  We all understand that  WWII was a terrible thing and that the Axis forces did hideous things to  Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, etc.  Do we have to keep reading about  it?  I feel like my brain has been drained!  It's all so depressing, so  negative.  Move on, people.  I might sound insensitive...sure, this was an  atrocious thing and deeply affected those involved, but move on.  My priest  says that we bear our own crosses.  The Holocaust is NOT going on now.  We  need to learn from what happened (I have!) and MOVE ON 
 I find it difficult to feel strongly about this film one way or the other because there just isn't much there. Newcomer and rich kid James Spader moves to a new town, pretends he's a rebel and quickly makes enemies with the local high school hoodlums. Being too darn smart for his own good, he falls for Lead Hoodlum's best girl. Lo and behold, she dreams of a better life and likes him right back, but is too afraid of Lead Hoodlum to trade up. Yawn. Spader's faux bad boy act wears thin very quickly and the cheese oozes rather heavily, though Kim Richards (aka Paris Hilton's aunt) is awfully cute and offers the film's only redeeming value. Whether or not one watches depends on one's desire to see Kim. 
 This toy looked cool in the package so I bought it for my 10 y/o son. He played with it for less than 10 minutes and it was trashed! The nose was caved in, the wings were broken, it was in like 5 pieces. If I hadn't been sitting there watching him play with it I would have swore that he tore it apart. All I can say is save the time and throw your $30 ( I got it on sale) directly into the trash! 
 It is very disappointing to have 40 pages of paper and only be able to print a little over half that number with the cartridge that comes with it. I now have three unopened packages of paper that I have no cartridge for. I think we should be able to buy just the cartridge when we need to. It sure would be nice. That is why I am only rating one star. Otherwise, it would have been a five....  Thanks, Marsh 
 Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry 
 Not really up to my expectation and I'm not impressed, there was no historical background on the Bloody Sunday, mainaction in the movie were streetfightings, killings etc. Would not recommend. 
 Let me first say that I am a fan of the books. They captured a biblical Christian world view, in combination with presenting a possible view towards the events following the rapture. The movies however lose the biblical world view, and come off especially as unevangelical.  For example, conviction of sin, and the depravity of man have been completely removed from the first two movies. When the characters witness to people, it is usually along the lines of "you didn't go to heaven in the rapture, that's where all the vanished people are, so you need to accept Christ into your heart...". It has removed the cross entirely from the picture. The atonement isn't necessary, since they never address the fact that every man has a problem: that they are sinners, who can not approach an infinitely Holy, and righteous God. The true gospel isn't preached in either of the first two movies. This does however change to an extent in the third movie, as I think Ray Comfort, and Kirk Cameron had more influence.  Another biblical quality that was present in the books, but has been removed from the movies is the Lordship of Christ, and living a transformed life. Although the characters in the movie do change what they're saying with regard to Christ, they do not really show a transformed life. It's much more of a, "well, now I'm a Christian, and I'm going to heaven. Hurray for me!" The characters say that they can't get enough of reading the Bible, but it doesn't really affect the way they talk, or even really behave. The presence and influence of God in their lives is generally limited to the eschatological setting that they are in, and rarely on a personal level.    Overall, the movies are still enjoyable to watch, and do capture the basic layout of the events in the books. To see the some of the scenes from the books played out on the big screen was exciting, and enjoyable. Just the theology that was present in the books has now been limited to eschatology. Perhaps they wanted the movies to be more ecumenical, but they really killed the biblical world view. 
 I enjoyed Ferling's Leap In The Dark immensely.  It was a well-written, far-reaching, grand book that formed a great cohesive work.  As such, i figured this book (about a very under-reported time-period in US history) would be a slam-dunk.  Not so.  It's almost as if Ferling expended so much energy with Leap that he decided to phone this one in.  It's incohesive, jumping around with little regard to logical continuity.  Yet, even at this, it comes off as a shallow non-scholarly work that is better suited to a magazine article than a book.  I was about ready to have Ferling join McCullough & Ellis as authors i would count on to deliver quality consistently.  Alas, not quite yet.  
 This is just like an updated B movie from the sixties and I enjoyed it.  It's real comic book stuff.  The effects are not bad, the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it's easy viewing.  I enjoyed this more than big budget films such as Evolution or Jurassic Park 3.  But I think the absence of big names will put people off, not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job.  And if big names don't matter to you then you could do a lot worse than watch this 
 I have been recommended to buy this book also.  And because Robert Bruce is famous in astral projection forums.  And everyone is talking about Robert Bruce is having meditation skills -NOT- I repeat -NOT- astral projection skills.  And everyone is saying, "when he is going to find out himself?" or no one is able to correct him, reading this book is making lot of astral projection fields, shaking their heads.  And in irony, Robert Bruce has another book titled "Mastering astral projection."  These two books has been misleading lots of astral projection learner.  If you want to get a book to see what are the mistake concept that Robert Bruce has, then get this book.  But any people with basic astral projection skill will know, that is Robert Bruce's more of mind-imaginary skills.  Many people has natural ability to astral project, all you need is the right pointers.  Not these silly near 500 pages.     Another great book is called "Successful Astral Projection to the Space and Universe." by Sapphire.  Lots of people can project within a week, some even the first day after reading this book.  Sapphire's book is proven successful astral project 
 I found that this was a complete waste of time!  I consider myself a very  spiritual person but this was so vague that I kept waiting for the  "meat and potatoes" so to speak.  I have a family member who is a  severe alcoholic and I found nothing in this concept that I could use to  try to help the situation.  Don't waste your money 
 Johnson lumps in "the gay lifestyle" with "alcoholism, drug addiction, sexual perversion, and any number of terrible problems that can afflict a family" (Pg 172). If you find this appalling, then avoid the book because there's a lot more of this.  If that doesn't bother you, then you might find some inspiration here. Clearly many have. If you prefer anecdotes/stories to bullet point advice on how to pick yourself up, this is the book for you.  But to be on the safe side, if you're looking for a role model in dealing with homosexuality in your family, do look beyond this author. While many believe that homosexuality can be "cured" with prayer, it is more widely held (by the medical community amongst others) that this is not a condition that can be cured any more than blue eyes or black hair. Be sure your approach doesn't do lasting damage to your child and your family.  
 Sorry Ms. Cornwell but this is not one of your better efforts. In fact, it reads like a first novel - too much insipid dialogue. Little more to say. I give it 2 because I finished it - barely 
 this is strictly a dvd production not good for the big screen. a very mediocre screenplay originated from a meidocre novel by one of the once-upon-a-time greatest novelists. sam elliot was a very bad casting choice, he's way too old for this action movie, he looked so tired to move around in almost all the locations. and the on and on flash-backs were the worst and the oldest directing and editing technique to be used in this bad movie. the cia and the cia operatives also looked so lame, so stupid and so unconvincing, they're just a bunch of wimps. the connection between cia and that bosnian mass murderer was also too contrite to be convinced easily. a brainless screenplay worse than the original bad novel. 
 This book is awful. I'm required to read it for my American Politics class. I don't know if the content is good because I have nothing to compare it to, but it is poorly written. It is often confusing because of how poorly it is written.  If the authors were to pass me on the street, I would kick them in their groins as hard as I could 
 This is absolutely the worst babyproofing product we have ever wasted money and time on...like the other reviewers, we cleaned the contact points for the suction cups until they were gleaming and it just wouldn't stick.  We tried it on 3 different toilets, all of which were slightly different in design, and it instantly popped off all three.  My 6 year old now uses it as a rescue tool for his Rescue Heroes.. 
 It was very weird because he never used proper English and always said cos instead of because and there are so many random words that have been fully capitalized.  I still have not finished the book but it takes a while for me to read it because of the confusing plot.  Recently a couple times I have had to re-read the part before so I can understand it.  In my opinion, if you are looking for the intense book that the back says you will be fooled.  I went into the bookstore and read the back and thought it looked interesting, but when I got home and began reading it...it was a totally different book than it says.  Do not buy this book if your daughter or son likes suspense book because it isn't. 
 As a new user of this or ANY such program, I find that this book does not cover the basics.  It was used in courses that I took to learn desktop publishing because of job requirements.  It's pretty much monkey see, monkey do if you have no experience with this program.  You don't learn the reasons why you're following the steps or how to decide which procedures apply when you're working on your own vice working with the lessons provided.  I'm looking for a book that gives you a foundation for thinking things through, and this is definitely not it 
 Rather than growing the story further. The author created subplots that are really pointless, particularly the diatribe on this dude who want's to be king, thus affecting the war effort. But seriously, who cares. Readers want to read about how the battle between the good guys and the bad guys turns out. Not waste 50-100 pages on how the good guys are bitching about each other.  And naturally, the protagonist - Pug. After getting captured, get's trained by the enemy, absorbed into the community, and elevated to a level where he is 'above the law'. I mean, seriously, the logic is pretty flawed.   The ending was wrapped up pretty quickly as well, and naturally, against surmounting odds, the same old formula of a 'saviour' appearing from no where that cleans up the mess and saves the day was used. 
 I was forced to read this in high school and it was awful.  The characters behave idiotically as if they have no common sense.  Liberals including my literature teacher love this book because of of the pro-communist and "blame the white man" views.  I'm not white, and I still found it impossible to relate to Bigger.  Young adults would enjoy books more if they weren't forced to read bad novels like this 
 First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.   I bought this book with 2 other books "The superhero book" (visible ink production) and "500 comic book villains" (Baron's production) and none of them satisfied me.   However this book is the only one which provides all superheroes with "pictures" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.   i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics 
 i lie howard's stories. ut his "successors"..... Well, this could actually have been good. good descriptions and suspenceful at times. but there are too many pages where nothing happens. and it is not necessary to use so much time to explain the intrigue through lengthy dialogue, we get it. and towards the end, it doesn't deliver. the ending should have been better and more a natural link to the story 
 Lights burned out after 4 weeks.  Way too much trouble to replace them.  Nothing spectacular; not big enough.  This product was a waste of money 
 I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...  Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album "Songs For Suicidal Lovers", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs. As www.evolutionofmedia.com said: "...aural film noir...delve into the dark side... 
 The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.        I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's 
 This map is small.  A good overview of Barcelona, but if you really want to navigate the streets by foot, you need a bigger map.  Though this map shows most of the streets, a lot of them aren't labeled.  You are better off just getting the Lonely Planet book and using the map in the back.  The only good thing about this map is that its laminated 
 I felt that this book really just skims the surface of so much.  Maybe Dr. Brazelton just wants to give a little info so that you will buy his other books... but I was unimpressed with this book 
 This collection is striving to be avant-garde. Too bad, because the pretension is so thick it gets in the way of potentially powerful prose. In places it get's so deep and so symbolic that no one could honestly  understand it's meaning. But, there is no accounting for the emperor's  clothes... I would love to see some of Justin Chin's real stuff...the stuff  maybe he writes for himself, not the things he prepares for the public. I  think he is an enormous talent waiting to explode (implode?) 
 If you were curious how a verbalist egotripper sounds on piano, then this is the right material for you. Mr. Jarrett had his only bright solo moments at his very first piano parolas (Staircase, Facing you), some good orchestral compositions (Luminessence) and a triple of great jazz ensemble moments (not so incidentally all of them with Dewey Redman behind the sax). And that's all about him- or rather not: Lately he is teasing the ears of classical music fans with some of the most soulless interpetations one can dream about 
 I READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOXED SET AND NOBODY EVER SAID THAT THE DVD IS SO DARK THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE A OUTLINE OF BRUCE ONLY. I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY, IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE MAIN PERFORMER THEN WHY WASTE THE SPACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE ONLY PERSON THAT YOU CAN SEE GOOD IS THE SAX PLAYER BECAUSE HE'S WEARING A WHITE SUIT AND ONCE IN A WHILE THEY PUT A WHITE SPOT ON HIM. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OTHER DVD'S..................... 
 For the last time, America was not founded as a christian nation, the Founders were uniformly hostile either to the christian religion or to the traditional "Trinitarian" churches.  America's secular destiny was and continues to be hijacked by zealots as (or more) dangerous as the religiously motivated terrorists they so often decry.  This book is their rallying ground and their manifesto.  I advise every true patriot to go out and buy as many copies as you can reasonably afford.  Then burn them 
 When I saw the movie, it had a score by Tangerine Dream.   I have a copy of that soundtrack on cassette.  I wanted to replace it with CD.  I purchased this cd and was completely bummed.  It's a great CD.  But not what I was looking for.  I loved legend when it came out.  Love the Tangerine Dream score.  I really liked the Brian Ferry song, Is your love strong enough.  Also missing is the "theme" song by Jon Anderson from Yes 
 Watching this movie I could not help but think I had been there before. During the training sequence when Costner's character was squirting Kutcher with water , I thought at any moment he would utter the words "Don't you do it! I got nowhere else to go!" During the bar scene when the boys were betting to see if Kutcher could "seal the deal" with the young lady at the bar I thought I was going to hear the tune "Take my breath away" playing in the back ground. These were just two of many similarities this film had with "Top Gun" and "An Officer and a Gentlemen". Truth be told, the Coast Guard action and Costner's personal battles in this movie were very interesting. It could have been a much better film if they removed Kutcher's love interest from the story. I have no problem with the boy meets girl cliché, but it was really unnecessary in this film. There was no chemistry between Kutcher and his "gal pal" and it did little to move the story along, so what's the point? This romance removed would have trimmed the film by at least a half an hour and made this a much better movie. I'm glad that in the final scene when Kutcher came to see his girl at her job he didn't pick her up in his arms and "take her away from it all" (ala "Officer"). If they stole that, I would have used this DVD as a skeet! I wish that Hollywood would realize that we don't have to have a romance in every picture made!  
 First and foremost, do your job as a U.S. Senator. Stop the book tour doing self promotion. How is the real estate issue going? Please explain!! 
 i am a huge De Lint fan, but i cannot drag myself through Moonheart.  this is an early attempt by him to solidify his ideas about celtic and native american mythology and their presence in a modern setting, and for that perhaps it was groundbreaking at the time, but after his later books, this is painful to read.  the characters are largely flat, though the setting of tamson house is a good and intriguing one. the super secret paranormal branch of the canadian mounties (!) is never made believable or interesting and i kept losing track of the cops' names, which didn't matter as they kept dying anyway.  anytime he creates a character of a specific ethnicity, the cartoonish stereotyping and deeply labored ethnic dialogue are painful to behold (i.e., the "rasta" man who begins every sentence with "I and I"); the character of keiran with his constant declarations of "NOM DE TOUT!" and "LORD JUMPIN' JESUS!" is annoying beyond endurance -- and furthermore, what is he supposed to be, french canadian or southern gothic with those odd declarations?  the scenes with the native american "manitou" read like bad B westerns written by Carlos Castaneda.  do read De Lint, but don't start here.  his later books based in fictional Newford are his best, especially the books that are collected short stories -- they're wonderful.  if you want to read one of his early Ottawa-based books, read Jack of Kinrowan which combines two shorter novels into one and which is far, far better done.  i'd hate to have someone pick up Moonheart and think that's all there is to De Lint 
 I expected more about this book, firts of all, only a quarter of the book contain the elementary Marketing principles and the remainder only cases. But the worse, there is not connection between cases and theory, not just one case example analysis, not reference at all in chapters with cases. If I had wanted to buy cases of marketing management without analysis, I were going to the Harvard Bussiness online to buy the school cases. Also in the back cover they say about "New Videos: Approximately 50% of the video segments are brand new for this edition", Sincerely I don't know where are those videos, no CD, no DVD, nothing in the website of book: [...] By the way, that website is too poor, in comparison to other website of books. Summarizing too expensive book for few effective information 
 This WAS my favorite little device. It's slow, as it's a hard drive and not a flash drive. But, for the capacity and price it was unbeatable. That is, until it suddenly locked up and cannot be revived, literally weeks after the meager 1-year warranty expired. A 2 GB Kingston memory stick has a 5 year warranty. I can see why this device has such a short warranty--it's completely unreliable long-term. Check out the other reviews-same problem.  6 months ago I would have given it 5 stars, but the obvious unreliability of the device makes it worthless in the long-term. Too bad Seagate can't raise their manufacturing quality 
 I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.   But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.    I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much "pop", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about "different", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.    Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called "keyboard solo" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.    I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.    Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from "good" to "great".    Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!) 
 In the first film JAWS (1975), Police Cheif Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) of Amity Beach had to deal with a giant shark up close.  In JAWS 2 (1978), Brody's senses told him that giant shark is still out there and while finding his two sons, he meets the shark again.  In JAWS 3-D (1983), Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong and Louis Gossett Jr. has a giant shark to deal with in Seaworld.   In JAWS: THE REVENGE, we shall see who gets the final revenge. 'Tis Christmas season in Amity.  Sean Broady (Mitchell Anderson) is now a deputy like his father was.  He goes out on a scouting boat to investigate.  Suddenly a big shark attacks him and kills him. Michael Brody (Lance Guest) and his family arrive to comfort his mother, Ellen (Lorraine Grey).  His father died from a heart attack, but Ellen believes it was from fear of the shark.  Ellen is upset and furious.  She doesn't want anyone in the family to go near the water again.  Michael decides to take his mother to his home in the Bahamas.  As Ellen finds new assurance in Hoagie (Michael Caine), the shark is after Michael again.   Roy Scheider does not appear in this film, only a photograph.  Lorraine Grey returns in her orignial role from the first JAWS and JAWS 2.   Fritzi Jane Courtney, who appeared in JAWS and JAWS 2 makes a cameo appearance,as well as Lee Fierro as "Mrs. Kinter", the mother who lost her son in JAWS.   Fans of JAWS were unhappy with the plot of this one.  Not enough shark-biting action.  It was nice that Lorraine Grey signed on to return, but the big mistake was mentioning "Martin Brody" died previously

 I am a serious poker player and am well read in finance (CFA), so i assumed the book would be a natural fit for my interests.  However, I have to agree with the other reviewers who said "the book is confused" and the author's "editor did not reign him in properly".  It feels like the author is just rambling on without a specific point or idea.  It covers too many topics (off the top of my head: hand values, poker history, put-call parity, utility curves, psychology, horse races, society and wealth, then he adds some personal stories).  All those topics may have been feasible if they were weaved together better.  Unfortunately, he covers some topics superficially and some in painstaking detail.  Some areas are written for an audience unfamiliar with poker/finance, then other areas dive into advanced nuances.  The book is just not edited well enough to be a satisfying read 
 20 wasted dollars! I obviously missed that the dvd was in american format. Luckily my son living in USA was home, so I could watch it on his apple-computer. It was also in no way possible to copy and open the film for european standard. Please make clear in the presentation of films if they only could be played in american format. 
 Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media.  The graphics of the book are truly beautiful.  The recipes however, hmmm,  try again.  I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result.  I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great.  Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness.  Graphics? Great. Photography? Great?  Recipes? You have got to be kidding 
 This Skip Spence Oar cd is really bad. To hear other peoples reviews it sounded like the best thing in the world. Its no wonder why this album was a flop when it came out. Thirty five years later it is not any better. 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 This is my first (and definantly last) IGOS published book. It is astonishingly badly written and the author states in the introduction that it's source is from "channeled" material to boot. The fake leather cover has the cheap appearance of a junior high school annual. It's hard for this reviewer to understand what makes this poor tome "ancient" or "dark", or for that point "magick 
 Save your money and don't buy this.  The recording seemed to play like it was coming out of a box and about 20 minutes into the music, the CD started skipping.  Not once, not twice, but repeatedly over the course of 5 minutes.  While I can make some concessions for the skipping for packaging error, the quality of the sound makes this a worthless buy 
 I understand that some terms are well-known, but in 1998, to use the term "nigger in the woodpile" in quotes or not does not ride well with me.  I have to read a handout from this book for a class. Had I bought the book, I would've returned it. But since I cannot return copies, I guess I'm stuck with it, but I will be complaining to my teacher about the use of this handout 
 This is what happens when great authors go to seed. It seems like a cruel mockery of a Greene novel, parading the same old themes around, corrupted more than ever by an unjustified excess liberalism. There isn't a single living character here, and even though the prose is generally competent, I think it has to be buried in consideration of the man's memory 
 This book gives the reader a number of bite size morsels about what to expect in the Emergent "conversation."  Unfortunately, that's it!  It is merely a very brief survey of a few aspects that the editors have chosen to bring forward.  There is no detailed explanations, no arguments, just straight-forward, "this is the way postmodern culture is and this is the way the Emerging Church should be" paragraphs.    Don't be fooled though, some of these concepts are much more thought out than you might think.  On the other hand, as a previous reviewer stated, some are not.  If you are looking for a description of the Emerging Church, I don't think this is the book you want.  But, if you're looking for a few paragraphs about different things they find important, you might want to check this one out 
 The first unit I got wouldn't charge the ipod nor would the cd player read any cd's.  Called iLuv tech support on the weekend and got a message that mailbox was full try again later.  I returned it and got a second unit.  Once again, the cd player wouldn't read any cd's.  Tech support did answer this time when I called during office hours 8-5pm EST.  But could offer no solution.  Return it a second time and I won't purchase it again 
 I have only one question about this movie. And that is, Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book?   If you haven't read the book than you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you have, then you do.  I can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly. Half the time while watching this, I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something, the colors were so bright.  If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes, locations, characters, and details from the story,then EVERYONE would love it. Not just 5 year olds.   It makes me so angry when I watch this movie. Yes, its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing. Everytime I loan someone the book, I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all. In fact, it is a hundred times better. More even.   I am really disappointed. I just don't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made. If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie, than I suggest they do it right. And if they do, then I'll be very thankful.  I just don't get it. The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. You wouldn't believe how much better it is.   I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book. Next time, please, please, do it right 
  How the H*** could someone get funds to make a movie and not be able to do a little better than this. IDIOTS!The skeleton mans costume looks just like something from a cheap costume outlet. Almost everything about this movie is lame. AVOID AT ALL COST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book claims to be written in a large font, however the font is barely larger than the paperback edition.  The large print edition is at most 2 points larger than the paperback, maybe a 12 or 13 point font.  What makes this book bigger is the extra space at the bottom of the page which is not all that usefull for making notes.  This edition is poorly laid out for enjoyable reading and useful notation.  Don't waste you money to get this so called "large print" edition, you should probably just buy the regular sized one.  
 This television performed admirably for 7 months. Great picture and good sound. Now...it begins to "whistle" more and more loudly after being on for one hour. It needs to be shut off, allowed to rest, then can be used for another short while. After 90 days any labor must be paid for out of one's own pocket...and any tv repair person will charge at least $80 to just come take a look...You do get what you pay for; I got a nice tv for $14 a month for 7 months! If you can afford something a little better it is worth getting something that is better quality 
 I was highly excited when i bought this book.  I am a very obsessed Led Zeppelin fan and was looking forward to reading it after listening endlessly to all of their songs.  If you are just starting with Zeppelin its a great book to read, but if you a huge long time fan, than i dont recommend that you buy it.  I already knew most of the stuff they said and the author lacks in explaining the actual meaning of the songs.  The 'analysis' is too short.  Ramble On only has one paragraph!! I was disappointed...the author is telling me some lyrics and some instruments that are used..its purely not enough..you can learn more by going on the message boards at www.Led-Zeppelin.com..and trust me i have.. 
 I tried. I really did and I went through first forty or so pages of "120 Days of Sodom" but it should be called "120 Days of Boredom". I stopped. I could not read it because it is not the novel really rather a catalogue of disgusting. The main characters have been introduced in the beginning as the fully developed monsters. Their victims just stayed that - the victims. There is no plot, no intrigue, and no development, just the endless loop of rapes, tortures, and murders. Yes, I understand that it is a satire and the absolute power corrupts absolutely but reading the book is a torture of boredom. Did I miss anything? 
 this is the absolute worst book i have ever been forced to and have ever read. i would like to add that i made a very strong attempt to get more interested in the plot of this book because it was a school assignment, but jeez, this was cruel and unusual punishment. when i think of this book, the word that comes to mind is "torture". i like a number of books and i love to read, i usually don't have a problem with book assignments, but this was just...just really mean. If you are smart, you will take my advice and stay far away.  
 I really had hope for this album, i really did. But i found it to be drab, lacking any noticable beat or melody, and most of all whiney, without depth, such a disapointment.... if you are looking for intresting vocal work as sia has done with zero 7...it is not here. 
 We never recieved our book, we were told it was out of date, which it isn't.  When we tried to contact the seller we got no reply.  I have been too busy to check if I was billed or not.  Can't you help 
 I agree with the last reviewer.  I purchased this book based on the positive reviews, but it is VERY light on content 
 Just like Medicine Woman I am not sure whether or not to believe just how much of this is to. Too many Beverley Hills like fantastical sequences of how strange people come in and out of the story. Is there really a Red Dog? Or and Agnes Whistling Elk. And the whole shapeshifting seems really bizarre outside a metaphorical use. Great read, deep descriptions of the Yucutan, and perhaps Lynne really does take some fascinating trips to the world in search of aboriginal wisdom. My one question: Are the Native community that are the keepers of this sacred tradition sharing the royalities from Andrews Production Company? 
 Stacey's book is a text from a series designed by evangelical Christians.  I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known that, but this small book may still have some use as a brief introduction to Blackstone.  It serves up an ideological view of the man the right-wingers are adopting as a founding father for their take on the Constitution.  Read with a great grain of salt. Less than 100 pages of text 
 Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly

 First off I have to say that I learned a lot more about modern piracy on the high seas than I ever knew before.  This issue is something that needs to be dealt with before it becomes a thorn in the side of our world trade.  I must add though, that this book is so redundant that it feels as if you are reading the same page over and over again throughout each chapter.  I was not impressed and it DID NOT keep me on the edge of my seat.  Bottom line here is that yes I learned something new, but my time could have been better spent with another book or learning something else 
 i remeber when this come in the 9th grade i got change to see jet li for the frist time and Isaiah washington i already know aaliyah i grew to her  i saw her talk about this movie  on rosie show i herad from my friends in school while i was in class one day nobody talk about much aaliyah was here . aaliyah did ok the movie was fake i seen his HK MOVIES HE did butt kicking than the soundtarck is better aaliyah did well on try again. buy ounce time in china or fist of lenged jet li best.  
 Well, I didn't really hate it. After reading others by this author, I snapped up the Hacker & the Ants when I saw it. I finished it only because  it kept seeming capable of being redeemed. It wasn't. I was very disappointed. Looking at the publication dates of this and his others will tell you all you need to know 
 Adapter advertised to work with Magellan 2200t but is the wrong adapter.  Not sure who is at fault but Amazon has not responded 
 In all meaning of the word stay away 
 With Edward McGee's whiny vocal arrangements coupled with lyrics such as, "I can't stand to see the slaughter, but still I eats the meat", this album's "chops" are nothing but mindless butchery. The  torture continues with sappy tracks like "You Ought to be Having  Fun" and "Make Someone Happy". What would truly make me  happy is throwing this album into a bonfire and roasting it to a crisp,  golden brown. Eating this tainted "meat" will leave you with a  bad taste in your mouth. Bon Appetite  
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.  I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  Granted, I am not a firm believer in just "the hard facts" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her! 
 I was very disapointed. The women can't sing. They sounded very cheesy and bland. Every now and then you night hear a sound that hits the spot, but most of the time tumbs down.. They got old real quick. I don't really think I will be listening to this album much at all. Don't waste your money. 
 I bought this book for my daughter, who has CP, like the girl in the story. I was hoping that it would be a story about living with CP and becoming independent. And, while it was those things, it also had some disturbing undertones... one of her friends (also with CP) lives in an institution and his mother visits him there once or twice a week when she isn't working... reading this through the eyes of my daughter I am horrified. That particular impossibility is something that hasn't ever ocurred to her; I don't need this book to plant it in her mind. Also, "being Sarah" sounds like being a girl stuck in a family with a cruel and unthinking father, an overworked mother, and fears about being institutionalized. This does NOT get a good rating, and I'm glad I read it first -- I will NOT let my daughter read it 
 This brainless, low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's Vampires was so foul and lame that the studios couldn't even bribe one of their lap-dog "reviewers" to crank out a glowing review for the DVD cover. Or maybe they couldn't afford the kickback--who knows? In any case, the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over-the-counter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that I used the DVD later to drain my spaghetti. "John Carpenter Presents"--a piece of incredible crap!! Its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile 
 There are alot of great pictures of arrangements in this book, but very little about the actual construction.  I bought 8 floral books and this was the only one that disappointed.  It does make a decent coffee table book, though.  If you really want this book, buy the used copy. You won't feel so cheated that way 
 Trust me. I went through many Exchange server books and I am an experienced system admin and Exchange admin. This book is the worst book for technical people. The concept in the book is for readers who are most likely a non-technical managers who want to have an overall knowledge about Exchange. If you touch Exchange server, do not read this book and waste your time. Go with Exchange 24/7 which is much better 
 i did not pay head to the other reveiws, and bought this bike anyway.  the first day i had it, the back fender snapped off, leaving sharp points exposed.  sadly, we had to tell our 4 year old, on his birthday, that he could not ride the bike.  so we returned it and got another one.  not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one, than the "exhaust pipes" came off, leaving a VERY sharp screw exposed, then the tire came off and the rim broke, becuase it was plastic as well. also, the vinyl on the seat started to come apart.    at this point, i had to return it, and fight to get my money back!!  it was a week after it had been delivered to the house.  i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk.  please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike! 
 But only because of the disgusting, horrifying arrogance put forth in this text. It would seem to me, based on extensive quotes I have read, and the reviews of others, to be basically a design for the Fourth Reich. The Americans are establishing world domination abroad, now we have the war that in the Orwellian tradition is endless, the "War on Terrorism." Which is a complete joke!!!!! When do you declare victory??? The end of "terrorism????" At what point do you go "Yep - got em' all!" The answer is...NEVER!!!!  I would never advocate banning a book. The idea of suppressing any type of speech is repulsive to me. This should be read, by those who want to know what's REALLY going on, as so many reviewers have stated. But I would say if any government out there wants to seek out THE most offensive rhetoric written in the last 15 years or so, going after someone writing about snuff films, or rape, or gang violence, or even kiddie porn, or whatever other despicable act of human nature one could conceive of...which has been done for years by government...should realize THIS despictability outweighs them all, and go after this.  But no one should go after any book. I still say it should be published. Freedom of speech is sacred to me. But it seems to me someone advocating the slavery of the human race to a plutocracy of people who rule over the entire world is far, far, FAR more offensive than...some perv who wants to talk about sex with kids. Both are despicable, but only one seems to get notice, seems to get calls for banning, when it's published.  Which is part of the game I suppose. Distract the unwashed masses from the true genocide and hell that is going on. 
 It was a nice read, pretty well exaggerated and the author, Mr. kscinski was not a very nice guy.  I was one of the clubhouse kids that worked for "Big Jim" back in the 70's and I can tell you alot of stories not in the book about old Big Jim.  This was a very greedy man and it seems like he still is.  Those were some of the best years of my life, but this man was a very bad example for kids that worked for him.  I look back at how you treated us and you should be ashamed of yourself.  I'll tell you what, if I ever see you again I'll tell it to your face.  You were a real Jerk and you can take that book of lies about your clubhouse and stick it buddy!    
 Having bought this knife over a year ago I must say I have had much better for less. I have since purchased a carbon steel Japanese Sashimi knife with a wood handle that is equal to the Global save it's blade requires a quick wash and dry to avoid staining. I find the Global's stainless steel blade to require less maintenance, however, due to its brittle temper the tip broke soon after I purchased it. My main critisism is that the continous metal grip is slick and with wet hands (as one might have when slicing a large fish) there is the distinct possiblity of losing your grip and your hand sliding forward toward the blade. In addition, the rear cutting edge of the blade adjacent the grip has a sharp edge exposed and given the slippery handle it is not as safe as other designs.  I wouldn't mind the high price as long as you get equal value. In this case there are better traditional Japanese alternatives easily found on the web. I suspect I helped pay for celebrity chef endorsements. I would not reccomend it to anyone unless a contemporary appearance is  more important than functionality; It is a good looking knife-even with a broken tip!   
 This was a miserable translation, even when it was first published, and for far too many years it was the only one avaiable in English.  Now, however, there are far better choices.  The Wood-Nisbet version published by Cambridge is far superior, but I believe that mine (HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RIGHT, Focus Press) is the best of the lot.  For some reasons, see either my review of the Wood-Nisbet edition, or Peter Kalkavage's review of mine, on its Amazon page 
 The jokes are pretty much what you would expect and there are a lot of slap-stick sight gags. I normally wouldn't have bought a movie like this but I needed it to make my Johnny Depp library complete 
 I am very disappointed with this book!  Where are the pictures of some of the recipes?  The price of this book, there should be photos of how to do something not bad drawings! I found the intro to be a waste of paper also, those pictures in the hard to see yellow/orange print could of gone behind the text.  I have yet to make anything from this book that turned out, which is wierd because I can make the stuff from Gourmet Magazine with no problems!  I especially do not like reading a recipe that is turned complicated because they have to be over the top with the wording!  I cannot believe I paid for this book!  
 I wasn't very impressed with this book.  The games for infants suggested are very obvious, common sense ideas, like picking your baby up and flying her in airplane style.  I don't think anyone who has an imagination will  get much new out of this book.  Also, it gives you song lyrics without the  tunes/music, which isn't very helpful.  While there are some good ideas,  they are too few to make this book very worthwhile 
 Goldman takes one of baseball's most entertaining characters and somehow manages to present us a story as lifeless as a pine tar rag.  There is no organizing theme to this narrative.  Although the  chapters are presented chronologically (playing career, managing in Brooklyn, then Boston), the anectodes skip around in an unorganized way -- making it hard to keep track of what is happening when, or why we should care.  Here's what's interesting: - Casey Stengel played for John McGraw, and they had a close relationship that amounted to McGraw willingly tutoring and nuturing Stengel's active mind.  McGraw was an important mentor to Stengel, as a faculty advisor is an important mentor to a graduate student.  (McGraw's influence among 20th century managers has been well documented by Bill James). - Casey was instrumental in shaping Billy Martin's playing career, both with the Oaks in the PCL and with the Yankees. But there are important differences between Stengel and Martin's approach to managing (although this is never discussed). - Casey managed some incrediblly bad teams (Boston Braves, NY Mets) and some incrediblly good ones.  And he liked to platoon players, use his bench, and valued multi-positional players that increased his decision-making flexibility.  On his best teams was able to rely on a few switch-hitters or star hitters that allowed him to save his platoon match-ups for players with reserve or part-time roles.  However, this rarely (if ever) was extended to pitchers, whom he constantly moved in and out of different roles regardless of their talent level.  What we don't read about in this book is how managers that came after Stengel also employed these kinds of techniques.  Whitey Herzog (for example) valued multi-positional players.  Earl Weaver built active benches with situational hitters around a few switch-hitting or star regulars (as did Herzog) and used complez defensive and offensive platoons.  There is a good anecdote or two in the text, but this is not the best source for reader's looking for funny Stengel stories.  At worst, this book merely reinforces the idea that baseball players are little more than Strat-o-matic cards to be shuffled in and out of the line up to manipulate probability distributions.  Upon finishing the book, we are left with little idea of how Casey actually liked to built his teams, communicate with players, solve problems or provide leadership.  We are told Stengel was (and considered himself) a good teacher, but we don't really know what Stengel was trying to teach, which is disappointing 
 Aside from the fact that one of the discs was cracked when I got this set (which Amazon promptly replaced with no hassle)this is a chronicle of an ambitious effort by rock and rollers who seemed to care and others who wanted to ride the coattails of those people. If you are looking for all the artists that played and all the songs from Live Aid this is NOT the set for you. In fact there's been some audio recreation on this set which I don't think is even mentioned in the collection. I felt gyped but you can read about it in Wikipedia's listing for Live Aid. Good performances by U2, Bowie and Queen as is expected but some of the other 80's acts are HORRID! I was at Live Aid and had no sentimentality for this package. The good thing is that this set promises to give some of the money to the Band Aid effort, though where that money will eventually end up is as mysterious as where Led Zeppelin's fottage wound up 
 I did enjoy reading this book but after a while Bare's stories about his more "famous" friends got a little tiresome. And I always found myself wondering, who is Richard Bare? Is he responsible for any of the greatest films of all time? The answer is no. In fact, Richard Bare's greatest achievement was directing all of the episodes of Green Acres. And that's it, most of credits are for television, not film. Personally, if I were to read a book about film directing, I'd like to read a book by a reknowned director, like David Mamet's "On Directing Film". Mamet was able to get through everything that goes into directing a film in a slim 107 page book. I'd recommend that book over this book any day 
 When I used the Nature Spirit spell in the book all sorts of bad things started happening to me afterwards and I felt the presence of evil in my house. I ended up moving because I knew everytime I went home evil was waiting for me. Don't mess with this stuff! The book sounds good but it unleashes bad spirits 
 Even though some of the stories are interesting, this book is nothing short of average.  Had little to do with the title.  
 I thought that the book was too small and many of the golf courses did not show pictues of the holes but rather a professional hitting a golf ball which could have been any where.  For Example, pg 92 Kooyonga Golf Club, hole No2 has two pictures of two golf pro's hitting golf balls with no picture of the golf hole itself. Similarly on page 24, Royal Melbouren GC hole No. 1, no picture but two close ups of golf pro's.  Los Angeles Country Club Nth Course, 3 holes , no pictures.  National Golf Club, Moonah course, 6 holes, not one picture.  Additionally, the structure of the book is poor as it should have depicted every golf course by hole in alphabetical order. Ie start with Aa Saint-Omer GC pg 1 and finish with Zaudin Golf Club on page 952.  Instead they have decided to chapterize the book from chapter 1 (1st Hole) through to the 18th chapter (18th hole) and fill each chapter with different holes from different clubs. If I want to see the holes of Spyglass Hill  GC I Have to go to pgs. 44, 70, 164 and 648.   Great concept for a book but dissapointing in its design and structure.  Peter Montgomery - Australi 
 Lots of people got smallpox, and many of them died.  OK, now you do not need to read this dull book 
 This book was horrible. I bought it for the practice tests, and not only did they repeat the same questions in the same tests on occasion, there were many cases where words were mispelled, or key parts of the problems (such as graphs) were left out completely. This book was of shoddy construction and should be avoided as a tool to study for the economics exams 
 Honestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it.   The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a "history" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets "evidence" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge "clues" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point.  In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you're REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas. That's the best C.S.I....period 
 I'm sure I'm being unfair to the author, but I was spoiled by reading RELIC,STILL LIFE WITH CROWS, THUNDERHEAD and (to a lesser degree) RELIQUARY, which are among my favorite books in this genre.  In comparison, I was underwhelmed by BRIMSTONE, DANCE OF DEATH, etc. I have just started Preston's TYRANNOSAUR CANYON, and I'm getting that same dragging feeling...It's not that it's not good, it's that it's not what you'd call a page-turner... 
 I first was a rent STAGE FAN, owning the original cast album and addictly seeing the play.  I then got this soundtrack, which leaves out 3/4 of the good songs.  I mean really: Angel does not even sing contact, and there is NNNOOO song "christmas bells".  Rosario Dawson sucks and should play britney spears, not Mimi.  I gave the original 5 stars and this one. OMG. Mimi should be EDGY not GLITZY. I feel bad that Daphne Rubin Vega had to watch her awesome part be ruined by Rosario Dawson's "valley girl" voice.  As for the original cast, especially Wilson Jermaine, their voices almost matured too much.So in the movie recording, Angel does not sound sweet anymore. If you buy the original cast recording you'll end up marrying the recording and worshipping it.  If you buy this recording it will etiher end up in the garbage or in the fireplace.   If you burn it-LAUGH 
 One needs to bring some critical thinking to work as to what one buys and reads.  I fully agree with reader Guido.  Images are blurred, of extremely poor quality and not truly informative.  There is only a small number of examples offered in the book (as if this were an attempt to bring about a touch of reality to a text that would otherwise be even dryer and engineering-oriented).  The limited range of materials and processes is not representative of the industrial design practice.  Besides, conceptual categories which were employed to organize the book seemed to me quite confusing and not logically classified.  The author does show knowledge of the subject.  However, his approach is not particularly didactical and complete--and therefore not as useful as it could be.  I don't feel this is the right text and the right form for industrial designers.  The book, in my opinion, does not live up to the promise of its title and price 
 As a political junkie, I loved reading "Election 2004", for the behind-the-scenes peek at the candidates' campaigns (well, mostly Kerry's). However, if you are to enjoy the book, you must realize that:  a) Newsweek is very pro-Kerry. b) the Bush campaign (wisely) kept them at arms-length.  So we get fawning adulation over Kerry's daughters, while Bush's twins are treated as snide pranksters. Laura Bush is "simple", while Teresa Heinz Kerry "takes charge". The Swift Boat Vets are "grudge-bearing" while 527s like Moveon.org are "groundbreaking". Kerry's team used "sound strategy" while Karl Rove and Karen Hughes cooked up "dirty tricks". You get the picture.  If you can stomach the liberal spin, it's still a good read and does provide a few tantalizing tidbits (especailly about Dean and how he was perceived by both the Democrats [crazy, self-destructive] and Republicans [manna from Heaven]).  The left-wing slant is made more bearable by the fact that Bush won 
 I feel I should preface by saying that I love this band to death. However, For Fans Only is pretty shoddy. Every negative comment listed below is pretty valid and probably more bothersome then one would expect. That being said, it's not without merit. I just wish it had been put together better 
 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 I bought this book when I decided to start a container garden on my deck.  I returned it the moment I got it.  It just didn't have what I was looking for.  Although it has some stuff that is pretty to look at it didn't  provide the instruction that I wanted and needed.  I wasn't impressed in  the least. I found a book that outshines this one in every way.  It's David  Joyce's Complete Container Garden.  A huge book with wonderful ideas and  photographs.  The best part is that it gives step by step instructions on  how to duplicate A LOT of the arrangements.  I am very proud of my new deck  and it is because of that book.  I learned a lot.  It has all of the info a  beginner would need yet it is interesting enough for someone who has  gardened forever.  Potted Gardens, by Rebecca Cole can't compare 
 Ugh!  I'm so disappointed!  I love Lady Sovereign.  I love all the songs on this EP.  But I had no idea that they would be CENSORED on this disc!  All curse words and objectionable phrases have been eliminated with editing, or in some cases, alternate lyrics.  LAME!  This EP should carry a label identifying it as a CLEAN version so that consumers know what they're getting.  Strangely, there doesn't seem to be an Explict Lyrics version available.  This seems to be it.  If I am wrong, I apologize, and someone please correct me, but I haven't been able to find any listings indicating both edited and explicit editions exist, which is extremely frustrating.  I have heard uncensored versions of these songs, so I know they are out there.  Unfortunately, they are not presented on this disc.  Awful.  Five stars for Lady Sov and these songs when they're uncesnored.  One star for the versions presented here 
 I read it because some people recommended it to me as "the father of travel writing". However, it's not been a page-turner to me.. 
 Everytime "Whoa Now" comes on, I flip the channel.  B Rich is a disgrace to hip-hop.  I hope he won't be around for a while.  Look at the album cover, that's the worst I've seen.  Pack yo bags and B Poor 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 there is no information giving. it took me 2 hours to finish whole book, which is less than 50 pgs.  dont buy it 
   A great story about the conflict between the environment and the economy. Also, a great story about what is right and wrong.   When a major casino boat is sunk by an environmental fanatic it only leads to trouble for this family. With the dad in jail and the mom ready to file for divorce the kids must do something to show how the dads actions were right. A risky plan to sabatoge the once sunken Coral Queen is taken in to action trouble and environmental protection is all that follows. A great book to "Flush" into your librar 
 This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw Bats, starring Lou Diamond Phillips IN THE THEATRE. That was two hours of my life that I will never get back. I could go into detail, but it just isn't worth it 
 I opened Out Of This Century expecting guidance, a light that would show the way. How did Ms. Guggenheim pick the good stuff? What muse informed her choices? Think she'll clue you in? Not a chance. Ms. Guggenheim isn't up to the task. This autobiography reveals a stunningly superficial personality. If you like soap operas you'll love this embarrassment 
 For inconvenient facts which he doesn't like, such as Alexander's sexuality, Rogers demands the most rigorous evidence good enough to satisfy a supreme court judge.  For inconvenient facts which are undeniable - the murder of Cleitus, the purges, the burning of the Persian city, the tortures of prisoners, etc. - Rogers forgives, justifies, rationalizes, mitigates, papers over, whitewashes, or simply passes over.  If Walt Disney ever decides to make an animated film of Alexander for children, Rogers would be its perfect consultant.  This biography lacks the competence or the neutral, even-headed perspective required of a true historian of Alexander.  
 I spent nearly 3 hours in trying to assemble the chair and found out in the end that there were 2 screws missing. So spent again 3 more hours disassembling it. Go to a physical shop and buy comfort products. Never buy online. You will suffer the pain i went throug 
 I have always been a prolific reader and rarely do I come across a book for which I can find no value, no redeeming qualities. But I must extend a hearty congratulations to Julia Barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement I have ever had the misfourtune to purchace. Teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense. If you are like me and just have to read it - just because you're obsessed with Austen - Buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it 
 What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good 
 All this book is written to do is Monday morning quarterback a situation that nobody could have dealt with flawlessly. Giuliani did the best he could at the time and under the circumstances. This book serves as a political hit piece by people who would be critical of the man because of his politics and not because of his proven track record. In my opinion there is hardly anything in the book that stands up as honest and deserved criticism, and the things that do are acceptable to me considering the situation.   In my opinion the authors knew darn well that if Giuliani runs for President, they would get all the interviews and book sales their hearts could want. 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 This book is good, but the book's content doesn't match the title. This book wasn't written for people who have never owned any piece of property. The book tells you a couple of nice loopholes and hidden fees most first time landlords will get hit hit with out the blue, but that is it! They have whole sections about owning 30 and 40 resident apartment buildings which is something 9 out of 10 people that read this book will not be doing for years. A lot of the advice that they give such as get a lawyer and someone to look at the property before you buy it is common sense. This book also doesn't go into great detail about taxes and how to set the correct rent level like I thought it would. This book is good for a general overview, but that is about it 
 I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great. We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick. He would struggle with feeding time. He was so gassy and had horrible reflux, that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry. I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr. Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence. However, he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable, their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big. We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning. I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr. Brown. So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore. So if you like the ventair I think you would like the disposable much better. My sons Dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but I was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age I wanted to see if I could solve the problem, which I have done completly with the Playtex disposable bottles! 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 This book is an inspiring read with lots of good examples. The main strengths of the book are its passion and  advocacy of integrity, values and taking people with you when you manage major change. Otherwise it is now very dated as a theory of leadership. It came out originally in the late 1980's when management was made the scapegoat for US industry's lack of success against the Japanese, hence management is never mentioned in the book. At that time, everyone was calling for leadership to replace management without asking whether management could be upgraded to be less controlling and stifling of initiative. Ever since then, management has been consigned to the bad guy role - Theory X, transactional and initiating structure while leadership got all the good guy work - being Theory Y, transformational and showing consideration for people. The result is a bloated, unfocused concept of leadership with the leader as hero who has to do everything. Their top-down conception of leadership is also old fashioned as it makes no allowance for bottom-up leadership which, because it is limited to challenging the status quo, has nothing to do with managing people. We really need a reinvented concept of management that allows it to be facilitative, supportive and inspiring too as it is in sports for example, but that's another story. The fact that this book is still so popular is revealing because it shows we have not moved on in leadership theory over the past 25 years 
 This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M.  The author trashes DOS as a "slapdash clone" and a "rip-off" of CP/M, which is simply untrue.  Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book.  Save your money and get a book that is better researched 
 I just wanted to write this review and warn people to save their money. My friend bought this DVD (thank god it wasn't me!) and we were both disappointed to see that it was a horrible print, badly transferred. This DVD is disgraceful, but the movie itself gets 5 stars, of course. Just thought I'd let you know: AVOID THIS INCREDIBLY LOUSY DVD OF POLANSKI'S CLASSIC FILM AT ALL COSTS!!! If you decide to go against my advice and buy it, well... I tried to warn you! I don't usually write reviews of DVDs, preferring instead to focus on the film in question, but this was one instance where I felt it would be unfair not to say "Caveat emptor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" If you have a region-free DVD player, get the Anchor Bay UK version (available through amazon.co.uk) for a much nicer edition 
 This bra should be called "fit to be tied".  The shoulder straps are too short, it runs small, there is no lining to the thin nylon fabric, and the band slips up every time you move.  And I am small.  I am a big fan of the Ice Flowers wire free bra which really fits and stays in place, and this bra is no comparison.  If you're looking for comfort and fit, don't buy this bra 
 I agree with bibliophile. Most of the 'free' things were catalogs. Here's a sampling of the 'free' stuff. L.L Bean Catalogs, pamplets on raising puppies and kittens from Purina, a free copy of 'Sheer Facts About Hoisery', a Lane Bryant catalog, Lilian Vernon and Harriet Carter catalogs, a free photo or greeting from the president. And the list goes on and on. What do these things have to to with seniors? There are about 100 pages in the back where they talk about free prescription programs and some State sponsored programs for seniors. That might be the only redeeming thing in this book. I returned it to Amazon. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow zero 
 The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?   The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off. 
 If I was Steve Miller, i would have been appalled with the way the record company edited down all of these great tracks. What the heck were you thinking Capitol? Every song is edited even the classics like "the joker" and "jet airliner". The best part of "jet airliner" is the awesome opening guiitar solo, well thanks to Capitol Records they edited most of it out.It sounds terrible. Don't waste your money on this highly edited album. If you want Steve Miller Band's greatest hits, I suggest you get Steve Miller Band "young Hearts"-the complete Greatest hits. Yes It might cost you a few bucks more BUT you get the full length versions of all songs and it is digitally remastered in stere 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 An unreadable exposition of the unknowable, or at least the ineffable. When Aquinas awoke to the realization that all his work was as straw, he probably didn't imagine that Milbank and company would be trying to send us back into that scholastic sleep one day. A little apophatic humility wouldn't go amiss here 
 I quite liked Alan Lakein's book, and got a lot of mileage out of it. However, I found his systems a little too simple to deal with the reality of my daily life. I'm in the middle of *Getting Things Done" by David Allen, and I find that it's much more real world. It also holds your hand a little more (e.g., step-by-step instructions on how to quickly get to the bottom of your inbox). If you (like me) are out of time and need to get organized, skip straight past Lakein and go directly to Allen 
 Save your money and buy Netzer's Encyclopedia of Food Values:  this book appears to be merely an extract from the larger work. You will receive four or five times as much information, although you still won't have dietary fiber information. 	The problem with Netzer's Carbohydrate  Counter is that it neglects to break the carbohydrate gram count into its  nutritional carbohydrate and dietary fiber carbohydrate components. That  makes this book useless for those people whose nutritional needs require  that information. 	This book simply gives total carbohydrate counts and  says "Th-th-th-that's all, folks.&quot 
 I first viewed this movie on cable, that same night, I purchased the movie from this seller.  To date, I have had no responses to email, no communication what so ever, and still have not received this tape in the mail.  Very disappointed, and not recommended to purchase from this seller 
 This book was first published in 1981, but later edited and republished with a new title in 1984.  The author was clearly influenced to change the direction of this book from the first printing because of his contact with YWAM, John Dawson, Richard Twiss, Daniel Kikawa and others who are hawking these same ideas.  Any good Christian anthropologist will tell you that history shows that, though most Gentile cultures had some sort of "supreme being" they worshipped, those "supreme beings" were one god among a pantheon of gods.  The Bible is clear that "from the creation of the world" all Gentile cultures had corrupted the knowledge of the true God.  Though the first printing of this book had some good ideas about cross-cultural methods to preach the Gospel to many cultures, the additions to this book prove clearly that it is unbiblical in its basic premise.  The new title "Eternity In Their Hearts: Startling Evidence of Belief in the One True God in Hundreds of Cultures Throughout the World" is an unbiblical statement.  Why do I say that?  Two verses end Richardson's unbiblical speculations:  Eph. 2:11-13  Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of  men)-remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now inChrist Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. Rom. 10:14-15  How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news! 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 I'm a fan of other Time Out guidebooks, particularly Time Out's Eating and Drinking in Rome, but this book is a huge disappointment.  First, the type is so tiny that it's difficult to read.  Second, the book is filled with advertisements - not just one or two but at least a hundred. This makes the book seem no better than the cheap guides you find for free in many hotel rooms. Third, in checking out just two things, I've found two errors. Ever hear of 22 volt electricity? That's what this book says runs in Argentina. (Correct voltage is 220 volts.) Another error is in giving the wrong page number for information about Teatro Colon. You are directed to page 198 which informs you instead about gay life in Buenos Aires. (The information about Teatro Colon is actually on page 204.) So, do I trust any other information in this book? Nope! Will I bother carrying this book with me to Buenos Aires? Absolutely not!   
 I don't doubt that UFO's exist, but this book is a sorry excuse for what the title promises: The real story of unidentified flying objects. It seems to me that the author is jumping to conclusions.. 
 The hyperbole won't seem appropriate to most people, but for me this was the single most un-enjoyable movie I've ever seen, ever. Every aspect of it was painful.   First, the production values: this movie is just ugly. I guess the biological computers are supposed to be a novel or deep concept, but it's just disgusting and really very poor looking. At times I thought they just rooted through the medical examiner's dumpster to gather props. I understand that you can't really have nice props in a low-budget movie, but with the setting and technology so central to the plot you think they could've paid for a decent production designer. Everyone says this is not a "special effects" movie and that the ideas behind it are what counts, but plenty of low budget movies didn't look this bad and were able to convey something new.  The acting: just one thing in a sea of annoyances here was Jude Law's accent. It's terrible, and he lets his native one slip several times. It's distracting and sloppy. The dialogue was just bad overall, so I blame the writer for most of this.  This movie is not "misunderstood." It's an objectively bad movie. It's unentertaining, boring, and scrabbling for a significance that only scraggly-bearded philosophy majors will care about and dogmatize. A lot of reviews said it was better to see it as a black comedy, but this movie is only unintentionally funny, if at all. I'd give it zero stars if I could, as I'm trying to warn people away from this turd 
 I've had the opportunity to watch the movie Stealth over the past week.  It was on TV here. Otherwise, I don't think I would have watched it.  My instincts would have been correct.  An action technothriller, Stealth has a predictable plot. A new elite team of 3 good-looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field: an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots, including a disrespect for authority. Mayhem ensues. People die. The leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence, and they work together to save the female pilot, who's gone down in North Korea.  The plot, direction, and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads (Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart.  I'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads, and came away disappointed. Me? I was expecting little, so I guess my expectations were met.  Though I will say I was amused by the last line 
 Just a rehash of the current fad thinking on compensation. Got to question the credentials of the author---PhD in sociology,  background in social work, never worked in the field, yet is on the b-school staff? With this social work background, one can see the roots for the bizarre "stretch" idea here---assign every employee a compensation case worker??? With its  outrageous tuition , the b-school students deserve someone with an apprpriate background. I liked the large font and graphics 
 I purchased this book based on the reviews found here and was disappointed after seeing the book.  The historical overview is almost identical to another book published earlier, The American Quilt: A History of Cloth and Comfort 1750-1950.  I thought that 24 reproduction patterns in one book would have been a great value, one of the appeals of this book, from the book description.  However, the patterns themselves are not up to the standard of excellence that I have seen elsewhere in other publications.  For example, many of the applique motifs are "hand drawn" rather than digitized, quilting motifs used in the original quilts are not included, for applique blocks, they offer "block diagrams" for visual reference, but they are extremely small (thumbnail size) and they do not offer any notation about enlarging (ie. "enlarge 500%) to use as an accurate placement guide, the instructions for all the quilts are extremely brief and assume that you have the knowledge needed for advanced techniques like pieced curves etc.  There are no helpful tips on what to watch out for to guarantee success with 'unique' aspects of each quilt which would have been valuable.  There was a one page tutorial on "windowing fusible applique" which was very well done, but I would never use this method on a reproduction quilt!  (Authors, please don't assume that we want to take the easiest route possible on reproduction quilts.) If you purchased this book for the history, there are better publications.  If you purchased this book for the Susan McCord photos, buy the calendar or see them online for free at the museum website.  This is not a critique of Fons and Porter, I have alot of respect for them, and I respect their accomplishments and legacy, however, on this project, I am left with the impression that they have leant their names to the effort, rather than actually written or created any of the text or patterns.  There were only a few quotes from them sprinkled throughout the pages 
 why is the song Thank God for you baby missing it was on the original album in 1969--I bought this cd for that one song and now im very disappointed that its not on there-4-3-07-tues eve. and it showed a 15 track selection but it did say it contained all 7 of the original songs but listed 15 songs on the cd--whats up with this i was decieved--was it Columbia's fault or what 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60 
 "A Night in Heaven" opened in 1983 to terrible reviews and even worse box office.  It was a mainstay on ten worst lists everywhere.  It was dubbed "Flashdunce" after another hit movie of that year.  Really, its not that bad.  Insubstantial, yes.  Ill-conceived, yes.  Entertaining?  Quite.  Lesley Anne Warren plays Faye, a speech professor at the local community college who is having marital problems.  Her husband Whitney (Robert Logan), an emotionally stunted inventor, has seemingly lost interest in her and she is becoming depressed when her sister Patsy (Deborah Rush) takes her out with friends to a local strip club.  There, Faye is surprised that the club's star stripper, Ricky the Rocket (Christopher Atkins), is the same cocky student she just flunked in her class.  When he sees her in the audience, Ricky does a virtual lapdance for her, and it isn't long before they have plunged into an affair.  Actually, there was probably a very good, serious film buried somewhere in writer Joan Tewkesbury's original script, which is glossily directed by Oscar-winner John G. Avildsen, who went from this fiasco to "The Karate Kid".  Unfortunately, the casting of Christopher Atkins in what was obviously originally a supporting role hurts the film considerably.  Cast after his breakthrough role in "The Blue Lagoon", Atkins received star billing and all of the film's pre-release publicity.  But Warren and Logan are the lead characters, have most of the screen time and obviously have the main relationship in the film.  This caused the film to be quite obviously heavily reedited to emphasize the Atkins character, who is a total jerk, completely amoral and unlikable, and poorly played by one of the worst actors ever to be spit out of the Hollywood system.  This sinks the film faster than the "Titanic".  As a result, what should have been a serious examination of a marriage at a crossroads becomes a smarmy sex-comedy/marital drama in which the disparate elements just don't fit.  Note the brief 80 minute running time.  This is one film which I wish could be reedited to a director's cut, so we can see what the writer and director's original intent was.  Instead, we will forever be saddled with the studio's botched reedit.  In spite of all this, "A Night in Heaven" remains entertaining and easy to watch.  Lesley Ann Warren gives a good performance here, although I'm sure this film isn't listed on her otherwise stellar resume.  Robert Logan is also quite good, although his presence is a bit of an eye-opener considering he is best-known for family films like "The Wilderness Family" and this film comes as close to soft-core porn as any major Hollywood studio film of recent decades.  Deborah Rush gives able support, and there's a decent performance here by an actress named Sandra Beall as Ricky's long-suffering girlfriend Slick.  The late Carrie Snodgress also has a couple of good scenes as Ricky's mother.  Unfortunately, Atkins' horrible acting just about negates the performances of everyone around him.  It's impossible to do excellent work when the person you are acting with can't act to save his life.  It makes you appreciate Warren's work even more.  That she manages to give a good performance under the circumstances is commendable.  One note:  This film contains one of the sexiest love scenes I have ever seen in a film, and is one of only three reasons to see it.  The other two?  Warren's performance and Bryan Adams' now-classic love them "Heaven", which plays in its entirety over the opening and closing credits.  When you take away the seven minutes for these sequences, that leaves 73 minutes of story, which makes the cuts even more noticeable.  "A Night in Heaven" is one bomb from the early '80's that should have been much better, but remains more entertaining than many much better films of the era.  **1/2 (out of *****);  ** for execution; *** for entertainment value 
 It is the worst book I ever read. Subject matter is not explained properly. Examples are complex and lengthy. Don't buy this book 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 I began reading this book quite a few years ago but elected to stop after forty pages.  It is aimless, vile, and without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Be warned: this is one you'll be ashamed to put in the garage sale...if you don't decide to just set it up in flames and put it out of its misery first 
 I purchased this Westinghouse 37" 1080p monitor (LVM-37W3) because I was very impressed with its ability to be used as both a high-res monitor for work but also an HDTV for play (with an Xbox 360). The product itself is pretty good--the picture is great, colors are wonderful.   But if you have any kind of problem with this product, it is game over. Westinghouse Digital has no online support to speak of. I've sent numerous emails through their site and have received no responses over a month. I finally got in contact with a customer service agent through my extended warranty service and it turns out Westinghouse has NO LOCAL TECHNICIANS to even examine your machine. You have to ship it to them (at your cost) for them to examine, and they said it will take 6-8 weeks or more before they will get back to you. This policy is completely egregious--2 months time to fix a quickly depreciating machine and it costs the customer shipping??   Do a little research and you will see all the customer service horror stories with this product after people have had it for a while.  Go with a real manufacturer with local repair technicians 
 Don't take the star rating wrong - this is as good as any of the other books in this series, but this edition (Quiet Vision Publishing - paperback, printed in 2000) is the cheapest printing of a book I've ever seen. Only about 20 pages into it, pages started falling out of the back. The type is huge and goes all the way to the edge of the page so your thumbs are constantly in the way while you're trying to read, and there are typographical errors like using two hyphens instead of em dashes. I know they make an electronic version of this book. As part of my job I convert a lot of print-intended content to digital publishing formats, and that's what usually happens to em dashes during that process, so I almost wonder if they just printed out their digital version and bound it. It looks like it was printed on a laser printer (especially the terrible cover illustration which looks like it was drawn by a 12-year old), and the fonts look like they're just PC-standard 'Times'. There are also several footnotes, which in the original edition that I read years ago were placed at the bottom of the page they were referenced from. In this edition they're in the back of the book 
 It took me about 3 days to figure out the little box with the tiny book IS the book I bought! I thought it's a nice gift came with the item I payed... I guess I'm a Dummy!  I don't understand why so many folks wrote comments under this item while the comments are indeed for another product:-( 
 this band is terrible. they get worse and worse and people seem to like them more and more....  this is a waste of time, uninspired, irrelevant music, with paltry vocals and "drums" the drummer stinks....the name of the album is Drums not Dead and the drummer stinks.... The pace of the album is horrible, the vocals are whiny and breathy. this band is a transparent attempt to seem relevant. just like all the hipsters from their native williamsburg, brooklyn residence.... i like lots of weird music. there is absolutely nothing in this album that can hold my attention for more than a second (this coming from someone who loves miles davis and godspeed you black emperor and boris, all bands that reach and break the 20 minute mark and still remain interesting)....in fact, after purchasing the songs and trying to listen to it in various situations (ie, as background, while working, while sitting back and closing my eyes and trying to absorb it) i eventually just deleted the songs from my computer...   i couldnt even stand hearing it when it was shuffled with 3000 other songs... steer clear and if you really want such "experimental music" pick up some 70's era Miles Davis. Miles should have named his last few albums Drums not Dead, cuz that group had some freaking rhythm. And if thats too "old" or "outdated" for you, then go buy some animal collective, or aphex twin, or boards of canada, just dont buy this and leave another review giving it 5 stars...please 
 I had to hear Time's Up (Dust Mix) from a P to P download (unfortunately @ 128kb) and got fixated on it's trippy groove. I can't really stand any Moby stuff, but this one had me hooked and I had to have it.   I'll leave the rest to Moby fans 
 Maybe I should have titled this entry "Slightly Underwhelmed."  It's not horrid, but it doesn't quite reach average, as far as bathroom reading material is concerned.  I saw this book mentioned in a newspaper article while flying back home a few weeks ago.  The article made it sound like this book would "tell it like it is" from a flight attendant's perspective.  Sure, there were some cute little anecdotes, but nothing at all earth shattering.  Most of the little snippets weren't even unusual in any way--it was what I'd expect from someone with six months under their belt, not 18 years!  And, though I'd never heard of Mr. Hester, I figured that he must be a very good story-teller.  After all, there must be hundreds or even thousands of flight attendants who dream of writing a book, so you'd think publishers would pick the best writers out there (or at least the ones with the best stories).  As these stories aren't anything special, surely, I thought, this guy must be one hell of a writer.  Now, I admire anyone who will sit down and write a book.  That takes a good deal of time and effort.  But in the end, let's just say that some people's writing style isn't what I prefer.  And I'm afraid Mr. Hester falls into that group.  In the first four pages, I began to wonder just how many similies an author could use.  How many times can someone use exaggerated metaphors in place of adjectives or adverbs?  How many times can someone use the same word in a chapter?  While I didn't have any problems with his occasional bashing of big corporations, pilots, and supervisors who take their job a bit too seriously, I had a big problem with repetitive prose.  Maybe it's just me, or maybe these were cobbled together from his newspaper column, so taken in small bits several weeks apart, one might not notice the redundant style.  But as a collection you read over a short time span, it jumps out at you.  Or at least at me.  Fine effort.  I'm sure he got paid well for it, and bully for him.  I'd just like to see a better written (or, perhaps more forcefully edited) follow-up with juicier stories 
 At first I thought I'd like this phone, but in practical day to day use it quickly became a disappointment. Specifically, there are issues with the phone reliably connecting to Skype and doing even simple things like playing voicemail messages (it now plays them for us but we can't hear anything, from either of two handsets). In addition, it has been disconnecting and reconnecting from Skype continuously which is highly disruptive.   Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention. When you're on a call, and another call comes in, it beeps in your ear and EVEN WHEN YOU REJECT THE OTHER CALL, IT STILL BEEPS ENDLESSLY, FORCING YOU TO ABANDON YOUR CURRENT CALL TO MAKE THE BEEPING STOP. Totally annoying, and makes the phone useless.  A very poor, immature, 1.0 product. Save your money and look elsewhere 
 ...but that's where this one went. I've never read a more poorly written, sycophantic, piece of embarrassing drivel than this "biography" of Doris Day. The archaic, obseqious style is neauseating and could never have been authorized by Ms. Day, I surmise, if the sweet little octegenarian weren't a little dotty herself, making her and this "author" very compatible. If you are the least bit literate and hate wasting money, move on 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 Volunteer Slavery is how a freelance writer named Jill Nelson - who had never worked a full-time magazine or newspaper job in her life - was hired by The Washington Post, one of the more ruthless corporations around. Unfamiliar with office culture due to lack of professional experience, Nelson is unable to handle the hostile office politics of the newspaper and eventually quits. All the while, she blames everyone else for her problems, trashes seasoned pros, and details her sex life and substance abuse. Nelson's book is dishonest because she lacks the courage and inner-strength to examine what her "authentic negro experience" was really all about: she was hired by The Washington Post because they wanted to hire an inexperienced minority staffer that would fail. One of the most sinister practices in journalism is when white employers deliberately ignore and do not hire the legions of seasoned, award-winning, and tough minority journalists in this country - whom they know will survive and triumph over office politics - and instead hire green rookies that are easily crushed. Afterwards, white employers can quickly replace them with a white employee and claim, "well, we tried hiring a minority, but.." and still claim adherance to diversity in the workplace. Volunteer Slavery reveals more between the lines than anything that appears in actual prin 
 Sixty-four out of the 66 reviews currently up talk about THE BOOK. The product listed is THE AUDIO CD of the book. I ordered the CD set for Christmas, and it was good - up until the final, 6th CD. There, one section repeats over and over, over all 18 tracks. It's the part of Chapter 26 where Thor and Kate meet Tsuliwaensis. Each track is not identical, but the part of the book that is read, is. Needless to say, you never get to the thrilling conclusion of the book.  Amazon quickly replaced the CD set (thank you!), but the replacement set has THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM. (I apologize for appearing to shout here.) Has anyone reviewing this product actually listened to the CD from beginning to end? Are they all this way, or have I gotten two clinkers in a row?  Thank you 
           The major prediction   made by Glassman and Hassett in this book,written in 1999,was that"A sensible target date for Dow 36,000 is early 2005,but it could be reached much earlier"(1999,p.140).This fantastic science fiction forecast,like the similar 1999 fiction forecasts of Abby Joseph Cohen, Elias(1999)and Kadlec(1999),was mathematically and economically impossible since the single best predictor of future stock market values is the rate of growth in gdp(gross domestic product).To obtain a Dow of 36,000 by 2005 at the latest would have required continuous quarterly gdp growth rates of 7%-8% from 1999 through 2005.Starting in late 1999(Sept.,1999) through March,2000,the 3 wisemen,Warren Buffett,George Soros,and Peter Lynch,liquidated all of the stocks in their portfolios and exited the market.They transferred their cash to other assets.Unfortunately,far too many financial investors failed to follow them out of all of the stock markets and ended up losing about 8 trillion dollars.The best long treatment of stock market behavior is the 3 rd edition of C.P.Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes(1996).His major point was that you automatically have a bubble once you start hearing  claims that there is a new economy that represents a complete break with all past market fundamentals.This was precisely the claim made by Gilder,Laffer,Wanniski,Glassman and Hassett,Elias,Kadlec,etc. Paul Samuelson's 1996 prediction-"Sometime in the next five years you may kick yourself for not reading and re-reading Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes"-hit the nail on the head.The best short treatment is still chapter 12 of John Maynard Keynes's 1936 The General Theory of Employment,Interest and Money 
 This book was casual to read, flip through, but did nor have any real information that would help a pitcher. It did have a big name in the title 
 This was a gorgeous show, but kind of conservative -- made Richter into the new "master" of painting, sidelines all his weirder and more "conceptual" work. And why does Robert Storr have to try so hard to put himself at the center of everything?? I saw the Richter show in SF around 1990, so no, this is NOT "the frist American retrospective." And Storr's dismissive (and often really uninformed) treatment of other critics (especially German critic Benjamin Buchloh, who's written on Richter for like, decades) shows what a limited writer and scholar Storr really is. But for better or worse, the pictures are great, and a lot of the other material is really good 
 There were a few interesting nuggets of information in this book, but there were miles of reading between them.  The first part of the book is an exercize of retelling you how great this book is going to be and how it will change your business life.  The rest of the book is a smattering of pedestrian marketing information repackaged to sound like astonishing breakthroughs in thinking.  Yes, I understand the components of selling three ways.  Yes, I get it.  What a waste of time and money 
 I come with an axe to grind.  I wrote two playwriting books of my own.  But one of the reasons I wrote them is because I found so much in this one so wrong-headed.  The idea of starting with a theme or intellectual premise is so bass-ackwards as to be jaw-dropping.  In my experience, you don't start with a theme, you find yourself attracted to characters in a situation that compels you to explore them and it.  Sometime during the middle of the writing (if you're writing honestly), you may find out what the play's theme is.  But theme should emerge organically, not be imposed from the beginning.  To start with theme is like trying to build a skyscraper from the top down.  It may be where you want to go, but, like building a building, you need to start with scaffolding and a foundation.  I trust that when I'm grabbed by character and situation that there has to be some underlying thematic pull.  I don't want to force finding what this is out too early.  If I surprise myself a little, I have a good chance of surprising and delighting the audience.  Now, there is a different craft to writing the first draft and doing rewrites.  I suspect that some of Egri is more applicable to the second stage.  So, yes, obviously I prefer my own books (THE DRAMATIST'S TOOLKIT and SOLVING YOUR SCRIPT).  Also, Thornton Wilder wrote a terrific short essay on the subject in which he talks about the differences between writing fiction and drama.  Since he is the only writer to have won the Pulitzer Prize for both, he comes to the subject with credibility.    I mean, when is the last time you saw a production of an Egri play announced?  
 This book is terrible!!! I was forced to read this book for summer reading and definitley did not enjoy it, dont waste the 14 bucks to buy this piece of junk. I really hated this it is boring!!! Wallace puts too much useless info into the 576 pages of this hunk of crap. The first sentance is about two pages long and he often switches between 3rd and 2nd person, it is really annoying. Dont wate your life reading this book try reading "My name is asher LEv" by Chaim Potok It is truly an inspiring novel unlike this boring book. Wow i hate this book i truly hate it with every square inch of my body! I promise dont waste ur time reading this boo 
 Very disappointing - Nothing like Riverdance  Would not recommend and I am avid fa 
 AND THIS BOOK DIDN'T HELP ME UNDERSTAND THEM ANY BETTER. IT JUST CONFUSED ME MOR 
 I picked it up at my local library without previously having looked at reviews online. What a mistake! I kept thinking it had to get better, and it didn't, really, altho as one reviewer noted, the explanation of the influence of structuralism on Levi-Strauss was useful (but irritating).  In addition to no explanation of the math (which meant I kept looking stuff up online -- Aczel's choice makes some sense. Trying to explain category theory in a short, mass-market book would be even worse than what Aczel did do), choppy jumping around from person to person and within a person's lifetime (like he was trying to invent cliffhangers) and generally not being what the cover matter would lead you to believe (somehow explaining New Math, which it only barely does in passing, or telling an entertaining story of an academic prank, which it kind of does, but isn't what the book is really about), Aczel's attempts to place Bourbaki and structuralism in a larger cultural setting are intellectually bankrupt. You just cannot show that Bourbaki and a bunch of French mathematicians somehow convinced the rest of the arts and sciences of the need for structure/rigor/whatever, and ignore the fact that this was all occurring at the same time as Nazism/fascism/Stalinism. Like that is somehow an accident or coincidence? I think not. And I suspect that Aczel didn't think this through, which, given the people he's writing about, might be ironic, but apparently he's famous for this so it can't really be considered unexpected 
 I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film "Dick." "Dick" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).  Just go rent "Dick" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country 
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 "James Madison's worst fears were realized in 2004, when voters in a popular election lacked popular information and the means to acquire it."  Says Who?  That should be enough glaring presumption on the part of the authors about the type of person likely to read this to scare anyone from buying this book 
 Although Appelbaum's work won the Pulitzer prize & has received generally good reviews, she really has nothing new to offer.  This would not be a problem, however, she presents her work as being groundbreaking.  There are many good works on the Gulag by historians such as Oleg Khlevniuk,Galina Ivanova, and Amir Weiner.  Appelbaum focuses too closely on the intelligentsia, this is a natural occurrence given her reliance on memoirs, and misses or diminishes the experiences of peasants, prisoners of war, and the many national minorities that suffered as a result of relocation, exile, and collectivization.  As a history student, I am also confounded by her insistence that almost nothing is known of the Gulag, which is certainly not true.  George Kennan was writing about it as early as the 1950s, Conquest in the 1960s.  What she may have meant is that it has not captured the attention of American culture in the way that the Holocaust has.  Particularly disturbing are her comparisons of the Nazis/Holocaust and the USSR/Gulag.  The Gulag was truly horrible, but the entire history of the Soviet Union is not representable solely with the image of the Gulag.  As for whether or not the Russian's have come face-to-face with their past, anyone who has spent any length of time in Moscow knows this is also not true.  There are several memorials to the victims of the repression and the only reason that the current memorial in front of Lyublyanka is a modest stone from Solovki is due to the fact that the committee has been unable to decide upon a suitable monument.  The Memorial Society, for instance, maintains a very large archive of persons who were repressed and their family experiences;  their mission is to ensure that the victims are not forgotten.  There are Memorial Society offices throughout Russia and the former territories of the Soviet Union.  Kathleen Smith has written numerous works on their efforts.  Appelbaum's work is commendable, but it would be more useful to read any of the foregoing authors.    
 I agree with this guys ex-wife. He can't do anything right. Hope he wasn't as bad a diplomat as he is an author. Maybe he should go back to bartending. The old adage that "If you don't know a subject teach a course about, if you still don't know write a book about it" totally failed here! It was a total waste of time and money. 
 sorry to say but I did not receive the boo 
 Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs. Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it. Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free. Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!  The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer". With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!  As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it. Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs. So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs. Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed. Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished. This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.  It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months. Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span. It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.  Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.  Final note -  Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/features Linux: Free  Windows: One per computer, or buy more licenses Linux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for life  Windows: Boring; basic programs Linux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.  Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC. Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!  Windows: Constantly gets attacked by viruses Linux: Quite a lot safer  Windows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be some Linux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OS  That's just some of the reasons why I love linux 
 The title of this book is misleading.  to call it the new male sexuality is quite the statement and one would thinkit encompasses  all forms of male sexuality.  This is not the case.  I totally agree with writing a book concerning straight male sexuality but that should have been a subtitle to the book.  The doc chooses to simply ignore bi and gay men as if they didn't exist.  This is not the new male sexuality.  Male sexuality is much more then five to eight minutes in the missionary position.  Straight couples these days are experimenting with new ideas and techniques.  The penis is only one component to the overall male sexual make up.  there are other areas to be explored as well.  If you want the straight nuts and bolts I guess this book will do but if yu are an adventurous male, look elsewhere 
 In this book, the author takes his students across the country, where they focus on any single aspect of American culture for 30 seconds, max.  It is the literary equivilant of name dropping, where the author attempts to  shoehorn in the names of as many historic sites, authors and rock stars as  possible in between stops for television interviews.  In painstaking  detail, the author ensures that the reader is constantly aware of the music  they play on the bus, and how it is the perfect background for the mood or  location.  In addition, the reader is "treated" to a laundry list  of attractions the group chooses to bypass.  Of course, there is the  occasional shrine they arrive at too late to tour, like Jefferson's  Monticello, and the author is only too happy to tell the reader about their  adventure trespassing, instead.  Pick up "On the Road" instead 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 I found that the author's philosophical ramblings were as uninformative as they were boring. I recommend this book to those suffering from insomnia 
 I was excited to read this book, as I have often thought about subscribing to the IBD (I've picked it up & read it several times at the library).  So I bought this book to try it out. I've lost all respect for this author & the IBD. Here are just a few of the problems:  (1) Frankly, it doesn't work: I picked 10 stocks & applied the CAN SLIM formula, and the portfolio did worse than my S&P 500 index fund.  (2) The method is deeply flawed: First he gives the steps to CAN SLIM, which is mostly common sense. "Increased trading activity indicates a stock may go up or down in the near future."  Duh. Next, he says the formula might not work in a Bull or Bear Market (which explains why my portfolio didn't work). Then, if you follow a footnote, you will read that it might not work in a Flat market either. !!! THEN he lists all these other caveats where the formula might not work. Excuse me? Just under what circumstance will this formula work? Full moon, on an even numbered month & odd numbered day, while sitting under a Sycamore tree? This is very fuzzy logic.  (3) It's terribly complicated: even if it did work, the daily research and effort to make your picks is not worth the payoff. There are much better books & newsletters out there, that make quarterly & annual recommendations that require much less research AND they pay off better. Try Bob Brinker's Marketimer, the book Dividends Don't Lie, or Adding to Your Financial Portfolio... by Christensen, et al.  (4) It's politically motivated (and naive): This guy actually thinks that Bush's economic policy is solid? It's difficult to find even a single Republican in the Congress who sincerely believes that a $6 trillion debt is a good idea. But William O'Neil not only believes Bush's overspending is a terrific idea, he applauds him for it & lobbies for Bush's economic policies. Amazing.   And, if you follow this advice, you too may one day be in debt by $6 trillion.  Bottom line: look elsewhere. I had thought Investors Business Daily was a reputable publication, but now I know better. I don't know how the IBD manages to stay in business with this horribly simplistic advise 
 Using this text to teach MBA students about new product development.  Probably the worst text I've encountered for a course, never mind lacking useful information for guiding managers in this field.  Incrediably lightweight with passing comments about rigorous engineering tools, and of little use to anyone to actually do anything relating to creativity, innovation or technology commercialization. Pick up something like Ulrich/Eppingers's "Product Design and Development" for a much more thorough and useful approach 
 This is not the worst book I've ever read, but it is very close!  It had potential to be a good read, but lacked in many key areas.  The characters were fairly interesting and decently developed individually, but the  outcome of all their interaction was not develped nearly enough.  The  entanglment of the characters had good plot potential, but ended up being  VERY anticlimactic.  I felt like the book was unfinished and probably  needed at least another hundred pages or so to round out the characters and  their situations.  It even felt as if it was published exactly as the first  draft was written, without any content editing, rewriting or further plot  development.  Every Day is Mother's Day is a book that had promise, but  fell quite short of it's potential 
 Warning: this book is only a rumination on the J2EE web services specification, fat on "theory" and with absolutely no real code examples you can run and play with to learn. Unless you are someone who can learn playing tennis looking at people playing it, or become a musician by listening to music, I doubt you can become a web services developer by just reading words and code snippets. As the author says: "this book doesn't attempt to cover installation, configuration, or deployment except in terms of standard J2EE requirements". I do believe that a decent tech book must have running code to support its explanations and support its value and usefulness. With this text Monson-Haefel is well on his way to win the "Most useless java book of the year" award 
 i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips, it just wont glide. you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em. clinique liners are the worst one in the market 
 I must be the lone voice in the wilderness and say I couldn't stand this book. It is absolutely awful. I could only make it halfway through. The author is not wise--she flails helplessly in her life. Reading this book is like watching someone drown. When her useless boyfriend upsets her, instead of dumping him or doing something constructive, she meditates "to gain the perspective of eternity." In other words, she does nothing positive to improve the situation and just goes back to him. It's tedious to read about.   Her prose is terrible, full of meaningless statements like "Sometimes a piece of knitting is simply itself," or 1950s cliches like "I've never understood the male animal." She gives a bizarre description of how she lay face to face with her drug-addicted boyfriend and "the bones in the center of my chest seemed to open" and they exchanged energy "in almost a figure eight pattern." When she meditates on her pain, she realizes that she "belongs to another reality, a larger conciousness, a vast and fruitful emptiness of luminous blackness and primal light." Say wha? If that kind of New Age babble sounds meaningful and special and insightful to you, you will probably like this book. I think it is nonsense. 
 I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 As a longtime Patriots fan living outside of New England, I was hoping that this book would provide me with inside information that I was missing out on without the local media focus. It was inspiring reliving the first Super Bowl victory over St. Louis, but overall it was dissapointing. There were a lot of interesting specific antecdotes (most notably the Tom Jackson exchange), but nothing that really surprised me and no real in-depth analysis of their winning ways.  The structure and grammar of the book are also quite poor. Although the book was short, it was not that easy to read as I had to continuously re-read passages to understand who the author was talking about or when the event was occuring 
 This is the third book by Mr. Evening that I have purchased and again I am disappointed by how the author can make a seemingly easy to use product so difficult to understand. I respect his knowledge, but would rather be able to start right in using a program with USEFUL tips rather than a detailed analysis on EVERY aspect. I will  stick with Scott Kelby's sometimes irritating humor because of his simple, yet effective means of explaining a subject 
 I received this "book" -- wait, no, it's a BOOKLET -- and I was shocked.  I couldn't believe I paid $25 for a comb bound booklet.  It's not even printed double sided.  Furthermore, I'm not impressed with the content.  The information is readily available in other books such as Entrepreneur Magazine's How to Start a Personal Concierge Service or The Concierge Manual, Second Edition.  This booklet should have been a download rather than a shipped "book".  It's certainly not worth $25.  I'm sure there was something in the description about comb binding, but I missed it (perhaps I expected different from Amazon).  I was a little more than disappointed 
 I bought 8 sets of these mats to completely cover my son's playroom.  Of the 8, there were 6 perfect sets.  The other 2 had VERY rough sections that caused major irritation on my son's knees.  When I contacted the company, they gave me a VERY hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened.  They kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though I was making the issue up.  In the end, I was SO unhappy with their attitude that I returned all 8 sets and went with another brand.  Be careful and check the quality of the sets that you receive! 
 When I buy from the "Back To Mine" series, I expect "smooth" and "groovy".  This one offers not much of either.  The individual songs don't always fit the late night mood, they don't work together as a group, and the transitions between them are jarring and awkward.  I can't recommend this CD.  Don't be duped just because you like Morcheeba, as I was 
 I read this book hoping for a clear understanding of Buddhism.  This book is written very bland.  Very few pictures too.  I find it difficult to read and follow.  
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 Jack Nicholson is wasted in this movie. He doesn't get to be JACK, he just plays a watered down characature of himself. But the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story. Sandler's character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff, a reprisal, but the point of the movie is that his character won't do it. So you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff. The movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage.  I chuckled at 3 throwaway gags in the film; the rest of the time I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over 
 I bought this book thinking it would have helpful pointers with women, but this 'complete guide' is nothing but a bunch of fluff.  16 pages into this book i come across a sentence that should have been on the BACK of the book.  It says, this guide assumes that you have read our other two books, blah, and blah.  At the start of every chapter they shamelessly plug thier other books, "in our last book, blah, we taught you how to blah, now continuing on from that point..."  Do not buy this book, it is very misleading and has little helpful information in it 
 Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie. 1. It is incredibly beautiful animation 2. The music is amazing 3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series The Things I don't like about the movie: 1. The characters are not developed at all 2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process.  Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series 
 Leslie Feinberg has written a well put together synthesis ofinteresting theories, some of which are self-generated. TRANSGENDERWARRIORS tells a story of human history as a tale of androgeny in which all men/women acted in concert and cooperation to solve all of life's problems until the rise of capitalism and patriarchy. When these two "evils" arose, they divided people against themselves by class and gender. Feinberg shows a smattering of knowledge of history but much of her book is feminist and genderist rhetoric. It is also a personal cry of outrage at how many people still treat those who are different and those who lack power. As a work of history it appears to fall short. As a personal statement, as an expression of FEELING of the author's pain and longing for justice it hits the mark.  As the webmaster of a transgender website I looked forward to reading the book. I found it interesting more from a human point of view than from a particularistic self-interest group view. The biographical sections of the book were moving. I found Feinberg's "solutions" to the social problems of alternate lifestyle people somewhat sophmoric.   EN 
 I thought I would love this book...and out of all the viking series I did like it.  But it was poorly written.   I have seen that Ms. Coulter does rewrite some of her novels this is definitely one of them that needs to be reproduced.  She had one to many loopholes that aggravate me as the reader.   I loved Miranda's character.  In my opinion out of all her characters I've read, I've only liked Alexandra Sherbrooke as my ideal woman next to Miranda.   What was disappointing there was not enough more combatative fighting between Miranda and those that kidnapped her nor just a visual between her brother and her.     Secondly with Miranda and Rorik...there was no romance.  I cannot figure how a man moves from detesting the woman to deciding to marry her...although there was a small explanation or round about, mainly Rorik's thoughts on how strong she is and capable.  But besides the romance...the sex scenes were horrid.   It seemed cold and clinical.  There was no passion.   Between Douglas and Alexandra, or even the Legacy/Brides/ and the rest of the Viking sagas..there was some kind of passion that gets you excited and into the hero.  But Rorik was horrid as a lover and poor Miranda just seemed unimpressed..until she decided to take things into her own hands...and then she had to be ill before that was sucessful.  So the quality of romance/passion was utterly lacking in this fic.  My main concerns would be to develop Miranda more and give her a bit more nuances, and expand on her fighting skills with a bit more action.    Another would be to definitely romanticise a bit of the sex scenes at least and give them a bit more loving relationship.  That is not only based on a marriage of convenience.     I think those two would change things a great deal and really improve the book 
 As a Renaissance scholar I was disappointed and shocked by the sloppy inaccuracies in Ms. Scotti's text.  While she tells an engaging story, she gets many of the fundamentals of history and architecture wrong.  The story, indeed, is one worthy of being told.  Ms. Scotti, however, does not have the teeth to do it well 
 In the fine print it says "The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players." This should be in bold face, bright contrasting colors on the cover! I have numerous different CD and DVD players and it will not play on any of them. This is very disappointing as I can't seem to find a "normal" format of this album 
 This is a self-conscious book that has colorful, detailed, highly stylized illustrations covering the theme of self esteem.  It's not a bad book, nor does it offend, but it seems kind of glib. Does anyone think a child will listen to this story and be injected with self-esteem? That kids really think it's OK to be a slow runner and be chosen last? That kids are all really well-adjusted and nice, making it easy to be yourself day in and day out? It's nice fiction, but it doesn't ring true to any child past the age of 4.  Another problem I have is that half the pages are written in a cursive script. My son is 7 and a really good reader, and yet he needed help with some of the book's text.   If you're looking for something positive to read to a child who is not yet reading on his or her own, this might very well work for you. I can imagine cuddling a preschooler, who would enjoy the rhythm of the words and the colors on the pages.  Older children may just look at you with a skeptical expression 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 Thank God I didn't and picked it up as a Bookcrossing book. No, seriously, what do I really think? YAWN! I've just finished chapter 8 and am still waiting for her to do something interesting. Although each chapter starts off with a quote about spying, the amount of "spying" she's done so far is contained in a paragraph and involves a short phone call. The rest of what I've read is devoted to  meandering through her past, in no particular chronological order, in the middle of nothing and jumps back to the present. Her memories are mainly about boyfriends she had or wished she had, small incidents about her past job that she hated(Doesn't hold a candle to The Devil Wears Prada), being cool and doing drugs in college. She spends most of the present trying to be cool with the homeboys in her office by making wisecracks on the fire escape during smoke breaks, or getting plastered and obsesses on a man, any man, as she can't seem to live a week without one no matter how much a loser. I'm afraid I can't finish this either. I have too many other books waiting to be read. I'm disappointed though because the title sounds like an interesting story 
 I expected alot more from Richard Harris. He was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of Abraham. Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai's name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess. Such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability 
 I am a huge Argento fan, but come on folks...this movie just stinks.  There's more corn in this flick than the State of Kansas.  The single entertainment value this film holds is that it provides a medium for a group of drunken men or women to polk fun at something.  There are maybe one or two admirable scenes in which Argento's uncanny editing and camera work shine.  Otherwise its a feast for the idiots; green blood, bad make-up and all.  Definately not one to purchase for the collection 
 I was excited to hear this version of La Traviata, just to hear Callas's voice. ( I am new to opera ). She has one incredible voice, but I've heard better sound on 3 stooges re-runs.  The sound is muffled, there is constant talking, coughing and hacking of people in the background. The singers sound as though they forget they are singing into microphones at times, bad dropouts.  I was/am spoiled with the Sutherland, Pavarotti (London recording). I still maintain this recording is much better. Not only is the audio far superior (yes, I know it was recorded about 20 years later), there seems to be some wonderful chemistry between Sutherland and Pavarotti that shines through.  All and all, I am glad I heard the recording, I just wish I borrowed it from the library and saved the $$$$$. Buy the Suth/Pav recording 
 I have always enjoyed every issue of Threads in the past.  The new format / contents does not appeal to me.  Threads is now a beginner sewing magazine like many others on the market.  Thread's was once a great magazine, the only one on the market for the intermediate and advanced sewers.  The projects were wonderful and I and other's I know kept every single issue.  Not now, there isn't really much in Thread's for the wearable art/advanced sewer.  I will really miss the couture finishing techniqes and other articles with new ideas. These articles were much more detailed than any book.  Because of this detail a sewer with some experience could use these articles to become an advanced sewer more quickly than buying many books. I only gave the 2 star's because it is a nice beginner magazine.  If you are new to sewing this is a good magazine, but the more advanced sewer's should pass this one up 
 As much fun as sitting in your accountant's office with your lap full of tax receipts. Of course, there are worse things in life, but please, remind me of what they are. Better yet, don't remind me! 
 You can find all the information (and more) this book provides on the internet. So if you have a little time to search the web, you don't need this book.  And it doesn't answer all the questions you may have. You still need the help of a lactation consultant or your baby's doctor. So if you have more problems than mastitis and engorgement, this book won't help you 
 Of the first three Anita Blake's novels this is surely the worst. This hit me as totally unexpected and I am very disappointed.  The problem lies in the plot, misconstructed, discontinuous, a heap of unrelated events thrown together with little sense, not to mention a mass of inconsistencies spread throughout the pages. Inconsistencies in characters descriptions and details are to be found in all the first four books but here we have mistakes such as Anita driving her car which was wrecked the night before and is again the day after. Hard to swallow.  In such a context that some ideas are really good and some characters very interesting matters very little 
 I was so excited about getting this book for my son.  I was looking for books to help him learn about being gifted and different.  The book explains the importance of books and gives a comprehensive list of books to get for children.  That said, after reading the book, I found that the majority of the books recommended in the book were not available - not through Amazon.com or any other online book seller.  Although the book was interesting, it isn't helpful if the books recommended aren't available.  That is why I had to rate it as disappointing 
 Let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic. Regardless of the fact that it didn't stick with a few key plotlines in the book, everyone still did a great job adapting the original Jurassic Park. Then came this piece of trash...  Whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book, this one just takes the brilliant writing of Michael Chrichton and throws it directly out the window.   First off, John Hammond is supposed to be dead. He dies at the end of the first novel. Secondly Ian Malcome is supposedly dead, or at least MIA at the end of the first book, and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd. There is no bratty daughter, and the entire premise has much more to it.  MOST IMPORTANTLY... the entire ending in san diego with the T-Rex... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies... did not exist in the book!   I went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot, a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist, and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off. What I ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page. Not only that... but because of the lack of plot, the dino scenes are complete over-kill. When you see so much of it, you lose that awe and wonder of the first film. When you see that Brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film, the wonderment is difficult to rival. There are no such moments in this film.  If you're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino FX, go nuts. However, if you're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline, flick off the dvd player and pick up the book.  Oh and one more thing... don't go NEAR the 3rd movie. They didn't even have a book to be untrue to. I can't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one 
 In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.  While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.  According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).  The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.    One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God."  He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.  In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.   According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.  Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.  In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.    While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations. 
 This book was poorly written drivel.  I didn't even finish this it disgusted me so.  I want to make sure no one else has to go through the torture of reading that.  And is it just me or is the science vessel named  after a Spice Girl (Victoria Adams)? I will never buy another novell  written by her/them ever again.  It hadn't even talked about the day of  honor and I was about halfway through 
 This is a classic circle jerk book that consolidates a number of articles from educators and educational researchers who talk about the same thing, and cite each other or similar data and research.  The authors do write well, so I gave it two stars.  But it has under/overtones of the same old myths in erroneous educational ideology that is actually the malaise killing our educational system - dump more money into schools; teachers are underpaid and overworked; high stakes standardized testing is bad.  Folks might be well advised to pick up a copy of Jay P. Greene's "Educational Myths" to run a little de-tox on the stuff they read here 
 The author makes some spectacular claims that would make a good Hollywood movie, but make for bad science. One of the most ridiculous accusations is the "Jewish" media purposely under reports the number of tornados ravaging the LA area. Another ...claim is Winston Churchill wanted to use Anthrax on Nazi Germany during WW II.    This book is very hard to stomach if the reader is looking for serious discussion on the topic of Ecology. The only reason I finished the book was to get a better understanding of how the environmentalist movement has been hijacked by radical elements 
 If the names of the characters are mythological derivatives and other similarities abound, you will not be surprised or shocked to spot the bad guys very early. Have I got a swan for you 
 This book is terrible.  It is very hard to understand.  Not recommended 
 I have been a fan of Peter Carey forever and have read all his work. His work, however,has become more bizare and unreadable with each new book. Weird characters  and a brilliant command of the language have always been a part of his style,Some of his stuff almost crossed the line (My Life as a Fake) to the inintelligible but Theft makes it all the way. I found the characters somewhat boring, and the language, idioms, references to times and places impossible to understand in many cases. Perhaps if you are a Sydneysider or live somwhere else in that great and beautiful country the book will make some sense. But for the rest of us---I am really sorry to report the book is not readable. I quit after reading about 2/3ds and for me that is unheard of. I feel like I have lost at good friend 
 How is this Scream 4 if Wes Craven is consisdering making a 4th installment to the trilogy? lol...and with original cast members lol.... i dont see this movie as Screams final stab....It might be a good film cause i love horror flicks...but this isnt the final stab....Scream 4 is set to release 2006...well thats wat i rea 
 Based on what I saw about this book it seems the "editors?" "Authors?" of this children's book were hybridizing the engenious works of Issa for their own gain. Not that it was conscious but I was searching for a SERIOUS collection of the works of Issa. Yuck 
 I orinally posted a very sarcastic review of this product, but when I contacted the seller, I was given a full refund.  Therefore, I will say they have good customer service, but I still don't think the product is useful for storing magazines.  They are made of a plastic that is simply not rigid enough to support a stack of magazines.  
 This is a good book to read on a train, but if you are looking for help in guiding you with communication help, keep searching.. 
 I read the first chapter and I was puzzled. Then I went back, read it again, and laughed. My tenth grade creative writing class can make a better effort at a plot, dialogue, and characterization than that, and be witty to boot. As for the quality of the writing, just the dialogue in the Quick Stop scene was enough to make my head spin around and explode. After reading this, I wasn't sure whether the author was high, or if he just hadn't seen a lot of Buffy and decided to make up the show and the characters' personalities (into something so juvenile and whacked out, it was almost incomprehensible). Did they let a 13-year-old fanboy write this? No, that can't be, because there is fanfiction out there that is many, many levels above this. ... Don't waste your money on this atrocious mess 
 nothing special, nothing enticing ... on the lines of frodor's and fromor's, just a bit more inefficient ... DK gives you pictures and more straight-forward facts .. i had purchased my usual DK (love the pics, the format, the lack of bias) and then once i chose my islands wanted a bit of something else .. went to amazon for reviews (don't we all) and found two island specific books which got FAB reviews and sounded perfect (Maui Revealed and Hawaii the big island revealed by doughty and friedman) but i also wanted one of all the islands so i got this ... so, i got disapointed .. the basics, a bit biased, unorganized .. love the Maui and Big Island books mentioned above .. they didn't do lanai which i'm also visiting, but do believe tehy do kaui .... i'd say spend your money on a DK and pick one of the focus books i mention .. if you want a bland book then go for this, fodor's or fromor's (though i would pick the "F" books over thi 
 It simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true. While this theory of economic imperialism isn't technically impossible, it's the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account. Books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as Ann Coulter books make the right look bigoted and, well, stupid. This is an incredibly implausible account, and books like this, claiming to be nonfiction, undermine good writing and reporting everywhere. Shame on the author and the publisher. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it contained a list of other books published by Berrett-Koehler, the contents of which make it obvious that BK is simly a peddler of 4th rate crackpot theories, all of which appear to be of the nonfiction variety. 
 My mother purchased this book for me. I think it was an "Oh, but she means well" type thing. I spent some time looking over the book and decided there are few things I have ever read that are more off track.   The authors disguise biased, overgeneralized stereotypes of how all men and women act with really cute and catchy graphics. They tell you what to do and how to act so that you can attract a lasting mate. Because we all know trying to change yourself or hide parts of yourself to impress someone else is the best way to develop an emotional and intimate connection. The back of the book says playfully, "Oh, great, another one of those dating books, right? Wrong!" Actually, yeah, that's pretty right. Except I'd rather read all those other dating books.    
 For a 2-disc, director's cut, my expectations were perhaps too high for this DVD.  Nevertheless, I was appalled at the poor quality of the transfer.  The colors were dull throughout, and focus was frequently not at the beginning of scenes.    For the movie itself, I don't agree that it is holding up well over time.  At 25 years old, the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who aren't waiting for their beloved canceled TV series to be on the big screen.  There's no question that II and IV are the best of the series, but comparing it to other Star Trek original cast movies isn't putting the bar very high.  My interest in watching this again was just having finished Melville's Moby Dick, the final scenes of which Khan repeats liberally during the final space battle.  That said, I think Montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed Khan and very evocative of Ahab.  However, Shatner's pretentious Kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on.  The original cast schtick just doesn't make for a compelling drama 
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
        I really wanted to like this book.  Unfortunately, the author's unbridled emphasis on medicating people with mental illness against their will was a constant theme. To my astonishment one character stated, "Once we got the right information, I must say that the system worked very well for us, up to a point: patients rights.  Patients' rights often clash with what's best for a mentally ill person."  I think every American (smokers, drinkers, eaters, authors) has the right to make bad decisions. To suggest that people with mental illnesses are somehow less entitled to the rights afforded to us by the constitution is abominable especially since the author uses an underground railroad sub-theme.  One more example of the author's insensitivity to people who are not like her is when she discusses how non-Latino doctors hire Latina receptionists so they can get more business from the receptionist's friends and family.  The stereotyped implication is obvious.            I found this book very stigmatizing of people with mental illness.  The "normal" characters were well-written and complex, but the characters suffering from mental illness were one-dimensional and underdeveloped and not representative of the majority of people with mental illness.  Anyone reading this book will walk away thinking that people with mental illnesses were all violent, dangerous and childish. This book does not do anything to destigmatize mental illness. Instead of addressing serious flaws within the current medical model of mental illness and the entire mental health system, the author engages in a blaming the victim mentality or in this character's case, her brain and its alleged imbalance. After all of these years of chemical imbalance talk, there is still no evidence of a chemical imbalance causing mental illness.     To suggest that the problem of mental illness can be solved with high doses of medications is limited at best.  It is also dangerous.  Although the author continuously touts the virtues of medications, she almost totally overlooks the problem of debilitating, and sometimes permanent side effects these medications can cause. The author alludes to these side effects in one paragraph.  The other 319 pages are like a free advertisement for big pharmaceutical companies.  Besides, a lot of those medications are only helpful to the people who interact with the mentally ill person and not the mentally ill person her/himself.  Use of certain antipsychotic medications mimics the effects of an actual physical lobotomy.  I guess the person would be easier to live with, but at what cost??      I did appreciate the author's attempt to portray the plight of families that have a member with a mental illness. However,her unfettered belief that drugging people against their will is a good solution to a complex and complicated illness was a big turnoff. I think that in 100 years the mass drugging of American adults and children will be viewed as another sad chapter in psychiatry's attempt to legitimize itself as a science. I think someone should drug this author and put her in a mental hospital for 72 hours.

 Eugene O'Neill may have been the father of American theatre, but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in Long Day's Journey into Night. O'Neill's characters were shallow, pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.The father-son relationship between James Tyrone and his son, Jamie, is meanspirited, and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems. Tyrone regularly refers to Jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn Jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, Edmund. Tyrone says such things as "You'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!"(p.32) and comments to Edmund that, "If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it."(p.131). The characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. The only seemingly normal relationship is between Edmund and Jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. The relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. It is as if they entire family is bipolar.  Long Day's Journey into Night was based on the life of O'Neill himself, with the character of Edmund as O'Neill. The mother of O'Neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between O'Neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted O'Neill for who he was. These sad beginnings continued throughout the life of O'Neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. If the characters in Long Day's Journey into Night are closely based on his family members then O'Neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine 
 these guys gave us some truly great music. back then, they were unconscious of what they were able to do and so they gave us metallic offerings like "somewhere far beyond", "imaginations..." and the un-toppable "nightfall in middle earth" , their best and IMO, their 'beginning of the end' album. bands do that and it is expected to fall into mediocrity after some truly masterful releases. blind guardian must again, remember that form is second to content in the realm of creation. they must forsake their colossal production budgets, overdone sound layering and pointless additions that can transform an album into a circus of chaos and disorientation. they must once again become the bards they were because we loved them then, and their music had magic. we dont make music that is 'aggressive', 'classy' or 'operatic' just for the sake of it. where is the idea behind it? why is it made? Nightfall in middle earth took the epic of Tolkien as its skeleton and wrapped around it some of the best speed/power metal ever created, where arrangements, orchestrations and all additional elements were welcomed to give the music the majesty of the written work that is the Silmarillion. let's not forget that Bathory's Quorthon (RIP) recorded some of his albums in his bathroom on a 4-tracker! just look at his legions of followers.. he earned them because his music made sense and radiated purpose 
 I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud 
 Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like 
 One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.    I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and    Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.    
 The plot for this movie is actually quite good, a microbiochemical weapon accidently created and released on the world is captured and is being brought back from Russia, but the Russians are trying to recapture it and release it on the major cities of the world and it is up to our "hero" to stop them before it happens. What ruins this great movie is the very bad acting. When asked if he knew about Agent Red, Dolph's character said it best, "Sounds like a bad action movie," and it is. From LT. Christian being seriously out of uniform to the underlying "love story", this movie just reeks. The only good thing I saw in this movie was Randolph Mantooth. His small part made up for the movie in my opinion. So unless you're a big Mantooth fan, this movie is a waste of money 
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 "Star Wars: Spinter in the Mind's Eye" has Luke and Leia shot down on a Imperial mining world, and then racing against Darth Vader to find a crystal with great Force power.  I guess I am a product of my time, I really didn't like "Splinter of the Mind's Eye".  It didn't make any sense in the grand sceme of the "Star Wars" universe, and it was a dully imagined story to boot.  I know it was wrote just after the original "Star Wars" was a huge success, and it was an alternate sequel if "A New Hope" was not successful.  It also was wrote well before any of the other expansion books were; but it still just dosn't fit in with the rest of the mythology, though I realize it is not anyone's fault at all.  The idea of a crystal being a Force power source (kind of like a battery) was silly; the handleing of Darth Vader and his cory dialouge was bad, Luke and Leia are acting a lot closer than siblings and was really creepy (this could have been avoided; George Lucas could have stopped it).  And where was han and Chewbacca?  But there are a few good scenes, like the breakout from Imperial jail and the duel between Luke and the primitives.  All in all; it is a book wrote way before it's time 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 ENCRYPTED MUSIC TAKES AWAY OUR RIGHTS AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND DON'T BUY THIS ARTISTS MUSIC! 
 This is a rudderless work.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why it's so often performed.  It's as if the work were written on commission. Every single act bears the mark of duty.    James Yanni comes close below when he remarks that "there is little to recommend this play that wouldn't likewise recommend almost any of Shakespeare's comedies."  I think the problem, more precisely, is that the devices used to such wonderful effect in Shakespeare's other comedies -- shipwrecks, twins, transvestitism -- are deployed here to no effect at all.  There is not a single sympathetic character in this play.  Everyone is obsessed with either booze or money.  The fool is more annoying than amusing.  The rushed, climactic scene in which Orsino, having pined for Olivia for five acts, turns his love abruptly to Viola (whom he has never seen outside her male disguise) speaks to how urgently Shakespeare must have wanted to put the finish on this awful mess and bring down the curtain.  For a taste of Shakespeare's comedic power, read -- well, read any other comedy he wrote 
 After close examination of this text, I conclude that from a Chinese/western medical perspective that this book is an attempt to make pseudoscience look convincing in order to support the marketing campaign of the authors. From a position of Chinese medicine and medical physiology expertise, they have failed.  Energy therapy is based largely on false assumptions about the brain. It uses a "thought field" approach as the main background theory. However, thought fields do not exist. The book explains energy as in positive or negative terms. However there are no physical similarities or correlates between normal energy and thought energy. Any physics scholar will know that energy does not work that way. There are know known physical correlates with new age notions of thought energy. The book makes feeble attempts to argue for the existence of these spurious and non recordable energy fields.  It steers clear of paranormal claims that are usually associated with energy medicine, but it is still pseudoscience  Qi is more accurately conceptualized as a philosophy, not a science, and its physical existence is not empirically supported. The book is completely unconvincing in arguing otherwise. In addition, they note that while acupuncture, a procedure used to correct the flow of chi, has been shown to provide some minor analgesic effects, its utility has not been demonstrated for treating illnesses or diseases. Chinese medicine uses a combination of treatments that work together.  The authors' proposed mechanisms of action are all spurious pseudoscience. There are simpler far more plausible reasons that may explain the few cases of success with the energy therapies techniques. These include placebo effects resulting from the mere expectation for improvement, demand characteristics, therapist enthusiasm and support, therapist-client alliance, and effort justification (i.e., the tendency to report positive changes in order to justify the effort exerted), and psychological manipulations such as distraction, suggestion, acceptance, and dissociation. These reasons are dismissed by the author, in preference for erroneous notions about meridians, thought energy, and the flow of Qi. The authors even claim that when the techniques fail it is because a negative person has "undone" them.  Considering that these techniques may potentially distract the patient's attention away from a serious illness such as cancer, and that the energy therapists in general do not cater for this eventuality, sensible consumers need to think more than twice before embarking on this pseudoscientific treatment. The book may convince you to open your mind for a while. However, please do not be so open minded that your brain falls out.  Regards Dr Le 
 James Patterson created a great character in Alex Cross and I have faithfully followed the series even though the last several have disapponted me.  The plot and character development have become weaker with each book. Yet I kept buying the books, even knowing that Patterson is more of a franchise that an author.   In CROSS Patterson has Alex wonder why his daughter wants to read the same book over and over.  When I read that line I realized that Patterson is making fun of his readers.  That's it for me. I'll not buy another 
 Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.    There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters.  It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!  I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.  Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!   
 The current, non-DirecTV system, updated by satellite, is actually 7.1 (as of 9 August 2005). I haven't found that any of the hacking books are especialy useful for Series 2 boxes, especially as the software upgrades 
 This is an okay read - nothing more, nothing less. The overall plot is very interesting and the story is well told up to a point. The real flaw though is the rushed, and in my opinion, corny, ending to this book. It really was substandard, straight-to-video, B-movie type of stuff (and yes, I am reviewing the book). I won't give too much away, but why at the very end would the chief baddie be the one to carry out 'the deed', and not one of his followers? And why was it the 'good' guy who tracked him down and stopped him carrying out 'the deed' - surely the police / FBI would have got him?   As with John Case's previous book, The Genesis Code, the initial plot will have you hooked, but as the story drags on it does become a little silly and rushed.   
 The author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing, the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery.  I find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as Bag of Bones and The Stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner. Fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict. A body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body. We learn the man was from Colorado but very little else.  If the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened. I would recommend a Mary Higgins Clark mystery in place of this boo 
 I have read all of the Boscastle series and I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. I loved the other siblings especially Chloe's but this one is dull and uneven. The "orgy" party where Devon and Jocelyn meet isn't the place that they should have been brought together again. I can't fathom how Jocelyn would be at this party when she is an innocent! Jocelyn's brother is "sort of" mentioned but we don't really know him at all nor her father, which could have created more depth to her character and would have given Devon more insight into his relationship.   I think it would have been more believeable if Jocelyn met Devon again while he was portraying the highwayman. What was weird is that Jocelyn's father just happened to show up in the tower where they were caught when he wasn't at the party previously. Also, along these lines is that the Boscastle siblings just appear out of nowhere. If I missed how they showed up then it just reinforces my opinion that this book is skim worthy not attention worthy.   I have learned from reading this author is that the mystery or villian really takes a back seat in her books in a major way. Usually the plot is wrapped up in a blink and you will miss it way. I expected more from this book especially since I loved Devon in the other books in the series. I hope that the Boscastle's continue on with a story on Gabriel or Charlotte but please make their stories believeable. 
 Be warned - this book is over 600 pages long and every character is a talking cadaver.  Yes, there are seven narrators, but, as many critics have noted, their voices meld into one - this lack of differentiation undermines the basic intent of the novel. Instead of being in the company of seven different characters, I felt I was in the company of a single person, the author - and he wasn't feeling that great.  The book reads as a dreary confession, one that would have any self-respecting psychiatrist reaching for his prescription pad.   * There is far less ambiguity here than you might imagine, and in more ways than one.  A change in perspective never overturns any basic fact about the plot or, more surprisingly, regarding a character's motivations - rather than being akin to Rashomon, where each view radically conflicts with its neighbour, here the narrators simply take turns telling the same undisputed story.  This lack of conflict between their vantages leads to a lack of tension; and in itself deprives the voices of individuality.  Yes, one character can see things which another can't, but it's more a case of adding to the overall picture, instead of actually angrily erasing and painting over the space.   * The rhythm of the sentences varies little from chapter to chapter.  This is not Faulkner.  The vocabulary is similarly uniform (as an example, "perfunctory" and "insensate" are used by Angela, while for Joe it's "obfuscate" - these being the two allegedly less educated characters).  The characters all achieve a similar level of insight into, and reflection upon, themselves. Perhaps most disappointing is the chapter voiced by Simon, the literary minded precipitant of events.  For all his alleged passion for poetry, his writing is bland and his references to literature rather limited - his voice does not breathe life into the bones of his character.  The dialogue is poorly written - in most chapters it would be difficult to tell who is speaking without prompts, and the overall tone is awkward and dead; perhaps the Dennis Mitchell chapter escapes this criticism. * The two prime female characters are drawn as stereotypically beautiful.  We are carefully informed about the size of their breasts, and the allure of their eyes.  In intellectual matters, they respectfully defer to their male superiors, be this the soulful stuff of art, or the technicalities of card-counting in blackjack.  Yawn.  There's not much evident irony in Perlman's choice of such representations.  When Anna reveals that: "He played me like a musical instrument", I had to check the cover to make I sure I wasn't reading Judith Krantz.  If parts of the book read with the flattened affect of an airport novel it could be because his characters, and his handling of them, share many qualities.  Then there's is the central issue of Simon's obsession with Anna - the narcissism inherent in this is impressive, but its exploration is limited - it might be raising the standard too high, but Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' shows how multi-faceted such an exploration can be. * Perhaps, more than reading the book itself, it's interesting to ask why so many people found it so stimulating.  The very flatness of the style does make it easy to read.  The attempt to begin a meditation on character by invoking childhood influences, adult relationships, and unpredictable events, is, as everyone says, ambitious.  It could be that the analysis proceeds at a depth which is comfortable for most readers - it allows fractions of honesty to become visible, while a veil remains over much.  Of course, fractions can add up to a sizeable sum.  My overall reaction to the book was negative, and reminded me of the mood created by reading books by Richard Powers - both authors construct plots which shape a superficial interest, and pen characters with surface complexities, but the crucial insight required for true empathy to be established is missing, as is a winning sense of humour.  At best this is a novel I might admire, but not one that I could love 
 I read the instructions.  Inserted a tape.  It made a horrible noise. No matter what button I pushed, nothing worked, just more noise. Then the noise stopped, and it won't do anything.  I can't return it because of the"policy".  I neglected to save the box.  What a waste of money 
 I like to be told a story. Although the book starts with a good story on how Bill Gates got started, it quickly digresses. This book is an accumulation of facts and boring accounts about Bill Gates and Microsoft. It never gets into the meat of things. I would have liked to have read more about the litigations against Microsoft. Maybe some more about Nescape's lawsuit. It mentions very little about the Antitrust lawsuit that I was looking forward to learning about. Instead we get quotes from Bill Gates that do not enhance the book, but instead interrupt it. The author references websites about Microsoft's and the government's claims about the lawsuit. It's like the author got lazy. Don't waste your money on this book. A very big dissapointment 
 I did not enjoy this book as much as other Elvis biographies that I have read. It is simply a hash of a number a biographies written over the years by the people surrounding him and hashed together by a writer -a good one at that, but at what -700 plus pages long it seemed to actually reveal less than some of the more personal, shorter and even judgemental books around. The Elvis biographies I personally liked best and would reccommend are "Elvis and Gladys" and "Child Bride" as well as Alanna Nash's book on the Colonel.. Strangely those were not included as the source for this book. Therefore I think it's wrong to call it definitive as has been in previous reviews. It's not bad but I don't think it's the best bio -even if others says so 
 I enjoyed the other Pilates for Dummies workout video, but this one was not that great.  First I did not like the instructor.  Her voice was annoying, and although her body was obviously built, she looked like some weird giant :).  That aside, I didn't like the workout.  The standing work was just ok, and the mat work was no different than the other PFD that was much better.  Rent it before you buy it, and you will understand what I am talking about 
 In this book a large group of Harvard economists and political scientists, and a few anthropologists, debate the radical proposition that culture makes a difference in economic development. While its nice to know the foreign policy elite are ready to think about culture as more than `western civilization,' it turns out that this allows them to blame all poverty on the malformed and defective cultures of underdeveloped countries. It's as if the `culture of poverty' debate never took place. Most anthropologists will grind away several millimeters of tooth enamel while reading this. Why do economists and political scientists feel like they don't have to read the work of people who have devoted their lives to studying cultural difference? 
 DMZ comes with a lot of hype and a hot topic - but about three issues into this collection of the first six issues you'll come to realize that hype and hot topics do not always make for a great book, much less a story.    DMZ: ON THE GROUND is a frustrating read.  It takes the idea of a second civil war in America and drops the reader smack in the middle of disputed territory - a war zone, a danger zone, a no man's land - Manhattan, and despite the changes, the city is still alive and kicking... and that right there is one of the main problems here.    The island still has people on it, living in the grey.  There is still power (although produced "on island" now through various means of blackmarket fuel and solar power), plenty of food (again, via the underground and rooftop gardens... there are even trendy restaurants for those looking to get above it all - also, if you thought that bamboo was just Panda food, then you've got a lesson coming to you here - like hemp, bamboo could solve most, if not all, of America's problems), weapons (everyone is packing something - and again, all blackmarket and underground based), and a somber a collection of gangs and groups with various points of view about the war and their place in it.  It's New York, even in war, even when it's being bombed to hell and back by the "American" Forces - New York as we know it, almost as we love it... and that right there helps to remove the reader from the college ruled five hundred word essay topic that Wood is selling us here.  The story is only as deep as the paper it's printed on.  Everything and everyone falls into sterotype and comic conventions.  Good. Bad. Right. Wrong. Salvation. Suffering. Hope. Despair.  And while we're shown images of stark horror, suffering and brutal violence - it's treated so casually that it reads like every episode of M*A*S*H you've ever seen.  It just doesn't make an impact.    Another issue with the book is that we come into the story blind from page one.  We know there has been some "war" and we know that Manhattan has become a DMZ, but as to how and why is unclear. There is simply no background given to us to help with traction.  Just how long this "war" lasted and how the United States "lost" it is not mentioned.  What happened to our nuclear weapons?  Are there two Presidents?  What are they teaching in the schools?  Did China take the Pacific?  Did Russia roll over Europe again?  Question after question rises from this book, and none of them are being asked by Wood - who seems to be more interested in writing a ROUGH GUIDE of Manhattan instead comic about war on American soil.    The subject is crackerjack and explosive all at the same time - but Wood brings nothing to the table but a pad of MAD-LIBS salting the book with nouns, verbs, adjectives and a famous location.  But, books like this are important all the same.  While Wood fails to capture the tone and feel of a country divided and a people torn between points of view and beliefs as to what America is or is not - the very idea alone is enough to generate discussion and hopefully inspire someone else to take up the subject to ask the tough questions and find the words to express them.  DMZ: ON THE GROUND never really touches earth, but instead just glides across the surface.  
 In all fairness, I will concede that I was an late adopter of Sister Hazel's musical stylings. It wasn't until I saw them perform at the House of Blues in Hollywood back in 2001 that I found myself sold on their brand of rock and roll. It wasn't long before I went out and slowly collected all their CD's.  After having purchased and listened to their album "Live Live," I asked for "Lift" for my birthday, thinking there was no way they could go wrong. I mean every album I've gotten by them, I've absolutely loved.  How quickly I was proved wrong.  When I first began listening, I actually started to wonder if the CD that was in the case was in fact a Sister Hazel CD. Their sound has been totally watered down and processed to the point where I haven't been able to find one track I like, and all in all, I feel a little cheated.  And given that their last real album -- "Chasing Daylight" -- was wonderful, I'm at a loss for words. While "Chasing..." was loaded with tracks I'd be humming hours after listening, "Lift" is a disc I probably won't ever listen to again 
 I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!    I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself.  
 Huge fan of the Art of Noise first album  "Who's Afraid...?",  the "original" lineup and all that. Not at all happy with what came next(  the novelty covers and duets with Maxx Headroom,  Tom Jones, Duane Eddy, et al) after Morley and Horn left. I had very high hopes for this highly hyped "reunion" cd, but I'm just not feeling it. The idea is very lazy creatively , rather Malcolm McLaren-ish ( it reminds me of his "Fans" album from the mid-eighties )and the execution is not up to par with their work together on "Who's Afraid...?"  Had this album been approached in a more staightforward way, like the William Orbit collection Pieces in a Modern Style, or even like some of Wendy Carlos' work as an interpreter of classical music using synthetic devices, it might be more inspiring or engaging. But as it is, this is for me  a big letdown 
 I really was looking forward to this release.  Sorry to say, the CD is lackluster and the production too.  Miss Ross sounds like she woke up from a nap and droned out these tunes.  Where is the excitement and creativity from her previous CDs?  I can't recommend this,  she needs to rethink the product. As they say on American Idol- no, no, no 
 Though a few of the lesson plans may, in fact, be beneficial for students on a middle school level or lower, in general, these plans fall under the category of "any high school student would see through them and roll their eyes at the cheese whiz factor." Though the book and the authors obviously have good intentions, the lesson plans and the attitudes with them reek more of political correctness than reality and seem to gloss over atmospheres that pervade our school systems today.     I was dissapointed with the format itself-- the chapter introductions were chock-full of uninspired teaching antidotes that did nothing to introduce the lesson plans themselves and seemed more of a way for the authors to toot their own horns, so to speak. The book is also organized by "season" which follows no pattern.     In short-- maybe in a suburban private school, these lesson plans and ideas are embraced by students. But in the real world, most high school students wouldn't take a single one of these seriously; especially with such wishy-washy political correct attitudes. 
 There is always an invisible factor that comes to play in these "Bell Curve" type books. The authors absolutely refuse to confront or even address the impressive successes of countless educators who have shown time and time again, that all races can learn and function at the highest levels of academia. I think that any one who tries to write a book of this sort has a professional if not ethical obligation to explain how the actual high achievements of  blacks and other so called inferior races factor into their elitist philosophies. I only hear about how these gains have been coached, or they haven't translated into career success.In the first place, you can coach a student on an IQ test, but you can't coach him all through his academic career.Either he is getting smarter, or he's not!Secondly, read of the work of minority educators, like Lorraine Monroe, Thaddeus Lott, Jaime Escalante, Gertrude Baker, Marva Collins, Herb Koehler, among others, who have PERMANENTLY altered the IQs of countless black and hispanic children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Dr. Lynn needs to be very careful, or he will suffer the same embarrassment the Bell Curve authors did when they made the egregious blunder of mentioning Marva Collins and saying that her work with ghetto kids was too good to be true. This prompted 60 minutes to do an in-depth follow-up story on the children they first interviewed in her  school some 20 years earlier. According to a statistician, most of these kids should have been in jail, dead or on welfare. None of the children were. In fact, most of them had been through college ( including Ivy League schools)and were lawyers, teachers,scholars, and productive members of society. Why doesn't Lynn and Jensen and Murray do in-depth research on these educators and their charges before writing so-called scientific and scholarly works? It is not paper theses and theories formulated in some isolated laboratory that matters, but the actual work of real live teachers, who are on the front lines every day, challenging disadvantaged children, and singlehandedly discrediting books like RACE DIFFERENCES. These teachers form the most potent yet invisible evidence for democratic vs. elitist education. Thank God their work has undermined  Richard Lynn's book before it ever went to print.What is  being discussed, achievement or intelligence? To write a book of this nature is indicative of some ulterior political motive, or worse! Do not read this book, unless, out of fairness, you read Intelligence Can Be Taught by Arthur Whimbey. Then make a balanced and fair-minded opinion, based on all the facts, instead of reading a book that only justifies your deeply entrenched prejudices. 
 Very surprised at the ratings on this book. I thought it was very poorly written and really boring. Actually, just the first 100 pages were boring, I gave up after that. 
 Absent of any quality.  Throughly disappointing.  All the Naxos Sherlock series is without ANY redeeming valu 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 For Spenser and Parker fans, this latest effort is a bit dissapointing.  The plot seems to drag, none of the characters are a bit likeable, and there are some scenes where you can't help but picture Spenser in a skirt (Ugh).  Parker's writing is a bit too formulaic for him to make the jump from a tough-guy detective novel to a tough-woman detective novel....the characters are too similar 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  It was sorely lacking in content, mostly it was like reading a big ad for a single model of DCC equipment.  I was looking for something which would give more than a general overview of the DCC system.  Coverage on the accessory DCC capable options would have been nice.  After getting this book I had to still go to the internet and research; this book should have been my reference.   I would suggest that you wait until version 2 or maybe 3 of this book before buying it, maybe then they might even add a table for the CV values and what they mean for a decoder 
 First of all you have to hand it to the author, or her editor, or the publishing company for coming up with this most memorable title in years. I think the title had a tremendous amount to do with the success of the book.  That being said, I have to be fair and reveal that I came to the book afer seeing the movie.  I thought the movie was charming and entertaining.  And it was reconstructed into a modern Cinderella story where everyone, even the "moster boss" has a dash of humanity.  The book is very inferior.  The characters are much more cardboard, the in-between-office chapters are long and boring, and the main character is whiney and unlikable (no one wants to hear someone with a dream job with lots of perks and a promising future complain because she has to work hard and put up with a difficult boss!)  But it was a clever idea to get the real life job just long enough to gather information to write the tell-all book. What a publicity coup.  What a stunt.  And isn't that what it's about?  So she earned her movie deal and big profits.  Who are we to complain?  Her timing in life brought her to a dream job.  She took notes.  She left.    She wrote The Devil Wears Prada..and we didn' 
 The only discipline lacking in this story, is the author's 
 As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English.  In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.  Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it 
 "The Island of Lost Maps" is the story of a petty crook named Gilbert Bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the '90s.  Posing as a researcher, Bland would enter rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single-edged razor.  Then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers.  Before being busted at the Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, he had stolen more than a half million dollars' worth of maps.  "Island" is the first book for author Miles Harvey.  In the book, he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page book.  He is only partly successful.  I found the material on Bland's crime fascinating.  However, Bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull.  Unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text.  I found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime.  There is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking. But as a true crime book, it over extends itself.  It would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused 
 The only nice thing about this book is the cover - waste of money otherwise...uninspiring, half these "original" designs I've seen in many knitting magazines. Perhaps the lesson learned here: don't judge a book by its cover!      
 I purchased this book after reading previous reviews of a new and cutting edge running style. After reading this, I am very disappointed. There is nothing new here. The running techniques used in this book are the same ones that have been taught and used by top runners for many years. Landing with your foot under your center of gravity, avoiding heel first footstrike, soft knees, high heel kick, fast turnover with short footplant time, avoiding braking action, running smoothly with little vertical motion are all running form pointers that are taught by any good coach. This is a very high price for a book that has very little new information 
 If one good thing can be said about Dread Pirate, it's that the physical game components reek of quality.  The cloth game board, glass jewels, metal coins, wooden dice and pewter game pieces all come together to give an overall sense of realism to the game.  It's a pity, however, that the game itself isn't nearly as exciting as the pieces.  Dread Pirate relies entirely on random dice rolls to determine every single outcome of the game.  To move from place to place, you roll dice.  To challenge another player to a "skirmish" (which is how you steal their treasure), you roll dice.  To steal jewels from an enemy's port, you roll dice.  To trade for jewels at a port, you roll dice.  There's absolutely no semblance of any real strategy in this game.  You win by accumulating the most treasure, and the amount of treasure you accumulate depends entirely on how lucky you are in your roll of the dice.    This game is not fun, and can even be frustrating, especially for a young child who keeps rolling low numbers.  There's SOME thinking involved...  you need to judge for yourself who you should attack and when, but even if you make the best possible strategic decision, you can still lose the die roll and end up empty-handed.  I would recommend Dread Pirate only if your family is specifically looking for a game where you don't have to think, and only if your children are mature enough to deal with bad luck (as good/bad luck is the only way to win/lose this game).  If you're looking for an enjoyable family game that everyone can play, I would very much reccommend Cranium over this.  It's less expensive, there's ALOT more to it, and it will have your family getting up, being active, and laughing out loud (instead of sitting around and rolling dice to determine the number of jewels you can take) 
 Maybe I haven't read enough "management" books (though I do have an MBA), but if this is considered "great" for this genre- WOW. This entire book could have been summed up in a couple pages without losing any major points, but I guess you can't have a bestseller that way! One reviewer said it was too technical. Are you living in a cave? I found it condescendingly written- absurdly simple and dumbed down. Granted, it's over a decade old, but I doubt everyone was really that much stupider ten years ago 
 I recall this movie fondly--Unfortunately, the DVD quality is so poor, this cannot be watched.  Pity Amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings.  Don't waste your time until someone cleans this up.  But it makes a nice coaster, though 
 There's nothing really bad about this slim book, but the writing is bland and cliches abound.  I found the book neither enlightening nor funny.  I'm a big golf fan and like Peter Jacobsen as a player.  I always like to see him win or do well.  I think that the problem with the book is that Peter is simply too nice a guy, at least in print (and that does not mean to imply he is not otherwise a nice guy), to be very interesting 
 I am a high school student and I am not ashamed to say that i have an affinity for children's literature, particularly english, such as Alice in  Wonderland, Harry Potter (all of them), and especially PETER PAN.  This  literature contains a magic that this author proceeds to bash at every  chance she gets.  I mean, are children supposed to read about oil spills  and war?  Preserve the magic of childhood people 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 Mr. Irving is a renowned writer who has pleased readers with books like, The World According to Garp, Prayer for Owen Meany and Cider House Rules.  There is a creativity about his writing and a quirkiness in his characters that I find appealing.  What happened here?  I was so mired down in wordiness and child sexual abuse that my commitment to the book ended with the protagonist's early grade school sexual experiences.  If somebody walked into a person's home and found drawings of what was verbalized in the book, they would probably consider the individual a pedophile and his home would be marked on public records as housing a pervert.  It seems strange that a brilliant writer could go on ad infinitum, describing the same things in words and be considered worthy of praise.  Anything the book had to offer was lost on me because I couldn't get past being inundated with pages and pages dedicated to pathetic images of a young boy's penis; crude and rude, abusive adolescent girls; and body hair fetish.  Maybe had I been pulled in enough to read further, I would have found redeeming value in Until I find You.  As it played out for me, the book is not worthy of John Irving.       
 This book has been completely discredited piece by piece. wtclivinghistory.org Honestly, I don't know how Langewiesche lives with himself 
 The author wants to fish out the contents of recent suspicions of the role and `function' manifestations of Judas.  Their observations may sound alien and dissimilar to many media discussions that have been going on in North America, and became more energetic during Easter. I feel they brushed the whole debate aside.  The momentum given to the arguments whether there was a `conspiracy' between Jesus and Judas is the works of the media - the newspapers, radios, and the TV - based on analysis allegedly emanating from ancient Coptic manuscripts (third or fourth century) - named Gospel of Judas. Analyzing, chemically, the ink of the manuscript remains controversial to me.  Was such action heretical?  I do not know but I believe this will lead to nowhere.  By rushing the information, which the National Geographic Society in Washington has uncovered, the media is trying to confuse our minds, like saying `there are more beautiful photographs of women than there are photographs of beautiful women'.  The American novelist James Cooper - has written, "" If the newspapers (media) are useful in overthrowing tyrants, it is only to establish a tyranny of their own"". Cooper pronounced those words in the mid 1800's when there was abundant news but little resources of intelligence to verify. Stunt news was then predominant.  And still is. Anything that attracts attention, a public figure, whatever he did, is news. Our century cannot be different from prior centuries when it comes to people trying to find proves and rationales for certain recorded actions and reactions that have taken place in previous times. The quest for discovering new venues will never stop as long as the progress in chemistry and technology continues on such quick pace. The point, though, is how the media is transmitting this data, and when.  For example: during the rule of the Bourbons in France, French gatherings in the royal court were very much similar to `sï¿½ances' where learned individuals, for instance, persons of high ranking families (mainly ladies), tried to rationalize the spiritualistic messages delivered by the distinguished Bishops, and Cardinals who had been appointed by the Pope. Such debates had notably been conducted in the short lull periods of peace times, when Europeans were not fighting each other and the material were printed by mass communication available during that era, but with restricted distribution. In their space of relaxation, rich and well fed and triumphant individuals tended towards exaggeration, so they extended their conversations to philosophize subjects such as `it's impossible to believe there is a God', or those who wished to demonstrate the degree of their `learning capabilities', so to speak, talked of how sceptical they were about the existence of God but never professed true atheism.  Some agnostics were doubtful and noncommittal about the whole subject of religion and wanted to be showy about their `enormous knowledge' and their `abilities' to discover new subjects for discussion. Some even equated such sï¿½ances with Freemasonry. Still, printed material on these meetings remained restricted. Renowned individuals like Verdi, Brahms, Tchaicovsky, Talleyrain, and Robespierre were famous agnostics.  Interestingly, in their lives they were peculiar kind of men, of no fixed occupation, vagabonds (but many of their works, whether good or bad, will remain ageless) and in their eloquent mother language parlance, they pretended to have acquired the luxury of `discovering' better, bright and distinct ideas with a supernatural attributes to even doubt the existence of God. And the media ran after them, propagated their views, and unearthed their personal memoirs and their mysterious and private exchange of intimated correspondence, much to the chagrin of the Church. Nowadays, the term `Conspiracy Theory' is having the greatest ascendancy. Like agnosticism, and scepticism in the old days.  The media is treating `Conspiracy Theorists' like window-dressing articles of a new fashion, a means of improving appearance and giving artificial and false impression. The media, to a group of conspirators, attributes any `action with a bang' to sinister design they have all performed together such as acts prohibited by law, or by means against the law.  But because human imagination is infinite, some media fat cats are going back in history to touch base with our Religion (Christianity)- and this book is not an exception and its related movie.  They are giving us the mental image of events that we always believed and perceived as real, as not anymore acceptable to the senses unless verified.  Think of it guys. Isn't it strange that on Easter Sunday this year (2006) there have been more media talks about Judas than Christ?  As far as I am concerned, these persons are loquacious, and very forceful in their trivial discussions that one might be led to pursue their pattern of offensive and garrulous thesis, supported by deft cameras and skilful writers. Many buy their books, which are becoming `best sellers', amid the sad division of our Church, and would agree with them on face value.   What a farce! 
 First off, I heard a track (dont ask me which one) on the radio the other day, and I asked my friend what was that crap, its got to be the worst hip-hop song I ever heard and my friend told me it was Juvenile..Hmmmmm...I no wonder why I dont listen to very little of today's hip-hop. Can anyone honestly say that this is an effort, this guy just rolls on and on like he has marbles in his mouth...Da da dahahahahhaah da da dad hahahahah...GEEZ! I mean there is some bad artist out there today, but this guy takes the cake...nice song back that azz up..whatever.....I know that everyone is buying this garbage is probely 15 and under cause I know people that grew up with PE, Run-DMC, EMPD, NWA, SNOOP, BIG DADDY, ONNX, and etc would have no part of this junk. If you want to hear some good of todays hip hop and still want a bit of a pop feel to it, then stick to Missy (who I think is the best female rapper) Jay-Z, Ludicruis (opps typo)or Freeway, and even check out the new Black Rob, the most underated rapper of the time...stay away from this junkhea 
 I found this book to be disgusting, and lacking any redeeming qualities or messages.  I agree with the reader who stated the language is shocking, only for other reasons entirely.  If you don't like trash, you won't like this book 
 I bought this film after being fascinated with What The Bleep Do We Know. The problem with this one is that Dr. Tiller assumes his audience has a background in physics..I am showing my own ignornance in giving it one star...But I couldn't follow the dang thing even though I knew the information was true and vital...If you're a dummy like me, stick with "Bleep"..Jack Schlatte 
 If you are hoping for an even-handed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of poststructuralism you will not find it here.  Belsley's introduction is mainly a work of advocacy and, as such, undesirable for those looking for a reasonably non-partisan overview. Disappointing 
 i have not read this book...i would look at it if someone tossed it to me, but i will not go out of my way to look at it, nor would i purchase it...for the simple reason that the author, mr. barkun, appeared on c-span, and engaged in a tag-team attack on one of the subjects of his screed, alex jones, along with the host, brian lamb...ANDDDD more importantly, he refused to appear on Jones' show when Jones invited him to discuss what he'd written, and what he'd said...and he apparently did not even interview jones for his book, which is inexcusable negligence from someone who purports to be a scholar - or from any author for that matter.. 
 I am a big Catherine Coulter fan, but this book is awful.  You can skip all the Soap scenes, a waste of space.  Much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat.  Don't waste the $6, borrow from the library if you want to read 
 It's a pleasant-enough book to get from the library and look at for 15 minutes, but I don't think it's worth the price to buy.  These are one-of-a-kind quilts from the covers of Quilter's Newsletter Magazine and I can't imagine anyone wanting to replicate these patterns.  
 This movie is just not scary.  I'm a HUGE horror movie fan and this movie has no tension in it, no edge of your seat fear.  I liked the sequel "Devil's Rejects", but that isn't much of a "horror" movie either (unless you think "From Dusk Til Dawn" is scary).  "1,000 Corpses" is about as scary as "Hostel".  It should never be mentioned in the same breath as "Texas Chainsaw", because other than trying to look like a gritty 70's horror flick, it has nothing in common with "Chainsaw".  It has a few moments, but they are ruined by cartoon-like scenarios.  Still Zombie has potential, his follow up "Reject's" was a definite improvement.  I didn't hate it, it's just not a scary horror movie.  Nothing new, no tension, but entertaining in some scenes, so I'm giving it 2 stars 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 Paul Gilster's, "Digital Literacy", is not a book about how to get around the Internet, but rather about enhancing the human experience.  The World now rests upon a point and click procedure.  He talks about how  landmark inventions, such as written language and the printing press,  changed how procedures were done.  He feels that the Internet ranks up with  these monumental inventions.  This is not a passing fad.  Gilster calms  fears about the possibility of the virtual library pushing the real library  to extinction.  They are parallels.  The virtual book is used for specific  information.  "The physical book is what I bring to the easy chair in  front of my fireplace to read, to explore, to mull over with a glass of  wine."  Gilster also talks about the importance of using discretion  when finding information.  Many sites out there are not credible, but many  are.  Make sure the source is credible.  This book is written for  individuals who already have computer knowledge.  It doesn't show you how  to get around the Internet, but rather, increases methodology on how to  find specific information, after exploiting popular resources, and a  reorientation of the thinking process.  I found this book to be boring, and  above my level of computer knowledge.  I would recommend this book to  individuals who spend an above average amount of time on the Internet, and  are looking for ways to increase their computer knowledge 
 We purchased our DVD player in June 2005 from HH Gregg for $140.  By December the screen would sometimes turn white so that we couldn't see the picture.  Within a few months the screen stayed white all of the time, so that now we cannot play dvds at all.  Audiovox wants $94 to fix it.  I'm sure thats the cost of replacing it. The sound quality was never great, but we endured it.  What a complete waste of money and theres no way I'm sending Audiovox another $100 for this or any other product. 
 I own two Greg Gorman books, Inside Life and Perspectives both of which feature his celebrity portraits.  They are wonderful collections and his photos of Keanu Reeves and Stephen Dorff remain among the most iconic and appealing ever shot of those two actors.  Truth be told however, I've always found Gorman's nude work on the dull side and much of this comes down to simple stylistic preference.  To generalize, there are two major styles of physique photography, the naturalism of photographers like Nan Goldin, Larry Clark and Bruce Weber that follows in the path of Wilhelm Von Gloeden (1856-1931) and on the other hand the stylized, studio-bound artifice of people like Greg Gorman, Robert Mapplethorpe (even his rougher work) and Herb Ritts that has its origins more in the physique mags of the 1950's.  As I See It falls squarely into the latter of these styles.  Where the naturalistic photographers are happy to explore real interiors and airy outdoor locations (preferably with people engaged in recognizable activities) people like Gorman are interested in re-creating a particular  stylized ideal with studio lighting and studio poses.  The models in this world don't sweat, break out or laugh...just pose.  All that's missing are (to borrow a phrase I once read) beach balls and hula hoops.  Compare this style to Bruce Webers.  While his advertising campaign for Abercrombie and Fitch may be monotonous, his book collections are funny, sexy and memorable.  I can call to mind individual photos from his last book Branded Youth whether the amusing wrestling camp series or the photo of the little birds clawing into the white shoulders of the boy with braces.  As I See It is a world of Tadzio-like models held at arms length by a photographer who is best when exploring what is unique about each of his subjects rather than making them all look interchangeable.    
 All men are thoroughly reprehensible monsters, criminal psychopaths until they are rehabilitated by the love of a good woman.  The author doesn't believe that gay people exist, but if you could convince him, he would no doubt suggest that gay men should be corralled into shot-gun marriages so they could be rehabiliated by the love of a good woman too.  I can see the new constitutional amendment: all men, gay or straight, must get married to women by age 18, or go to prison.  Or does the author believe that all men who are unmarried and over age 18 already are in prison? 
 This is Nick Warren's second release for Global Underground.  I hate to be the spoiler in a perfect 5 star rating from previous reviewers...but this is by far his worst compilation under this label. Don't get me wrong, I think Nick Warren is the greatest DJ on the planet.  Even for his versatility alone.  I just never cared for this phase in his brilliant career that this album falls into...his hard techno sets.  From 1998 until 2002, he loved this genre and predominantly mixed tracks like those found on this album.  Personally I hate techno and hard techno so I am biased when it comes to compilations that are predominantly from this genre.  You may love both these dics if the opposite holds true for you. It was really difficult to give an album with Nick Warren's name on it 2 stars, but it lacks that special "Warren element" that even his other techno heavy Global Underground releases had (ie. GU011:Budapest, and GU018:Amsterdam).  Maybe what I perceive as the "Warren element" is the inclusion of some great progressive trance and progressive house tracks which are completely abscent from Global Underground 008:Brazil. Disc 1 gets 2/5 stars and Disc 2 get 3/5 stars from me. Thankfully he ultimately ditches techno by 2003...right around the release of Global Underground 024:Reykjavik.  Yeah...that's the stuff. 
 Sounds just like the last record if you ask me.  Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with.  God bless him 
 A great disappointment. The relatively fashionable cover doesn't reflect the inside of the book. The window treatments shown in this book resemble one another  and are old-fashioned and plain. An "Absolute-Beginners" type of book,but even so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know 
 This book was a major disappointment.  If books could be returned for a full refund because of disappointment with the contents, then I would immediately return this one.  I liked the title and I am a fan of both Ali and Frazier and I was interested in reading more about their great third fight.  Plenty is written about Ali, but I was interested in reading and learning more about Frazier.  Well, 90% is about Ali and race.  6% is about Frazier and only 4% is about the fights themselves, including the third fight that the book is based on!  This book could have been a short magazine article, instead it is needlessly expanded.  I only finished this book because I paid full price for it and I knew that I couldn't get my money back 
 The works of Dan L. Thrapp which in any way deal with the Apache Indians are highly annoying to me. Of course, the non-critical reader and the casual reader of books on the Apache or on frontier history in gerneral may no doubt go through Thrapp's titles and actually think that they've gotten a superbly accurate amount of information about these Indians from a very capable author on the subject. Unfortunately for them, this is far from true because Thrapp is expert at using historic fact to camouflage what I see as his highly baised views of these Indians. Let me explain.  Unless the reader is already aware of a significant amount of detail concerning the Apache in gerneral AND individual Indians of this tribe, they simply won't pick up on what I would call Thrapp's infantile adoration, his seemingly "I-wanna-be-an-Apache" love affair with these Indians and several of their old leaders (which he relentlessly attempts to glorify through Politically Correct maneuvers of "writing in" or exagerating their personality traits and the qualities of their leadership, warfare skills, etc.  To the reader who has a good deal of knowledge about the Apache of frontier times, Thrapp's enthralled, school girl-like fixation with their various leaders almost oozes from the pages of his books. EVERY APACHE LEADER OF THE FRONTIER PERIOD(with the exception of one) was, if Thrapp's writings are to be believed, something of a superhuman individual with superior mental capabilities and ultra high-toned morals and ethics - Tragic Heroes of the Southwest who were victimized by memebers of Thrapp's own race.  Well, after reading Thrapp's "Conquest of Apacheria", "Juh, An Incredible Indian", and "Victorio and the Mimbres Apaches", I became so sick of this childish, Politically Correct type of distortion, that I decided to come on here and write a few reviews. In each review, I'll use JUST ONE example out of many I could draw upon to show the potential purchaser of Thrapp's books just what sort of "bargain basement" work of scholarship they're going to buy!  Please recall that I just mentioned that I consider Thrapp to be in love with old Apache leaders with the exception of one. This crush-like adoration Thrapp exhibits extends to Cochise, Mangas Colordas, Victorio, Juh, etc. BUT NOT TO GERONIMO. To Thrapp, Geronimo seems barely worthy of mention in terms of the Apache leadership. Also, Thrapp seems to desire to leave his readers with the view that Geronimo was grossly inferior in every way to all other Apache leaders.   I quote now from Thrapp's forward to "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey" by Eve Ball:   "A goodly share of this important book concerns Juh, the ablest of the militant Apaches after Victorio, although his fame was mainly among his own people, while for his enemies it lay submerged beneath the flood of reports, and ballyhoo, surrounding his subordinate, Geronimo, in every way a lesser man."  Here is another quote taken from Thrapp's "Juh, An Incredible Indian":   "With [Juh's death], the power of the Apaches to make massive war virtually died, for his successor, Geronimo, never became more than a minor guerrilla chieftain."  It is a matter of FACT that the Apaches NEVER had the capability to "make massive war" against Europeans in their entire tribal history. I could be gererous here and say that Thrapp's idea of what "massive war" might mean could be different from my own and that he is entitled to his opinion, but as an author dealing with historic FACT (not opinion) in detail, Thrapp SHOULD be able to comprehend the obvious! But by wording his comment about the leadership of the Nedhnis shifting from Juh to Geronimo, Thrapp once again reveals his desire to distort FACT in order to paint certain individual Apaches in a favorable light (or unfavorable, in the case of Geronimo) ACCORDING TO THRAPP'S OWN TASTE, NOT ACCORDING TO ACTUAL FACT!   I offer the following quotes by APACHE INDIANS who knew ALL the leaders of their tribe as a firm rebuke to Thrapp's slanted view of the FACTS concerning Apache leaders. These quotes come from statements given (person-to-person) by Apaches to Eve Ball, author of "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey". I ask that you read them and then consider Thrapp's assessment of Geronimo (which is firmly based upon Thrapp's bizarre dislike for Geronimo and not upon any concrete FACTS). By reading the following quotes,you'll see how APACHES (not Thrapp's fantasies) hold the memory of Geronimo in terms of just how important this individual Indian was to his tribe.   "It took a man to lead the Chiricahua. Geronimo was of middle age, a well-known fighter and a superb leader, and he was also a Medicine Man. No White Eyes seem to understand the importance of that in controlling Apaches." Daklugie (son of Juh) page 101 "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"  "Even in [Geronimo's] delerium, he talked of those seventeen men who had eluded five thousand men of the army of the United States for many years; and eluded not only them, but also twenty-five hundred Mexican soldiers - seventy-five hundred men, well armed, well trained, and well equipped against seventeen whom they regarded as naked savages. The odds were only five hundred to one against Geronimo, but they still could not whip him nor could they capture him." Daklugie (son of Juh) page 101 "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"  "We talked it over. Geronimo was shrewed and cautious. Also he had great Power, much greater Power than I. As you know, Geronimo could foresee what would happen. I relied upon that and upon his habitual caution to keep us out of trouble." Daklugie (son of Juh) page 173 "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"  "Death is not new to me. I had seen hundreds of people die. But Geronimo's death hurt me as had those of my mother, father [Juh], and brothers. As I sat beside my uncle [Geromino] I thought that he would never speak to me again and that the Apaches were losing the best they had. *Even though he [Geronimo} was old he had more influence than any since Cochise." Daklugie (son of Juh) page 181 "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"  "Although Geronimo had never brought attention to it, all Apaches, including the scouts, believed that his Medicine gave him great Power, and they were awed by it." Kanseah (young warrior with Geronimo) "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"  "...but of all living men I respected Geronimo. He was the embodiment of the Apache spirit, of the fighting Chiricahua." Daklugie (son of Juh) page 134 "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"  "He [Geronimo] had never been one, but he weilded more authority than did any chief." Daklugie (son of Juh) page 181 "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"  "We stood guard over his [Geronimo's] grave every night for months. Not one of his warriors, including Eyelash, failed to volunteer to take his turn guarding that grave. Many who had never been with him on the warpath joined in the lonely vigil. There were so many that we usually had at least two every night." Daklugie (son of Juh) page 182 "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"  So, Ladies and Gentlemen, there you have several quotes from Apache Indians about Geronimo, specifically from Daklugie - THE YOUNGEST SON OF JUH, chief of the Nedhnis, and a chief himself. Now do you see what I mean about Dan L. Thrapp superimposing his own TASTES on historic FACTS in order to color the final opinion of the reader? Geronimo, a "lesser man" who was nothing more in the Apache scheme of things than a "minor guerrilla chieftain"! That is Thrapp's great tallent - distortion through camouflaging his TASTES and BIASES under and around actual historic facts.   If Thrapp could deliberately mislead the reader about Geronimo, what and who else could Thrapp also offer a severely distorted view about?   With this in mind, I advise you that if you want to learn about the Apaches from accounts provided BY APACHES, read "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey" by Eve Ball.   Equally, if you want to learn about European dealings with Apaches from frontier people, read; "Life Among the Apaches", "Three Years Among The Comanches", and "Nine Years Among The Indians", all available right here at amazon.com  Forget about Apache wanna-be, Dan L. Thrapp and his slanted work concerning the Apache, their leaders, and their wars. True, Thrapp can swamp the reader in minute details concerning all sorts of incidents in Apache history and the conflicts and campains within these incidents in the 1880's, but gushing up from beneath this swamp of details always come Thrapp's crush-like fixations to distort and color according to Thrapp's own tastes, likes, and dislikes. As for me, when I want to read about historic events, I want plain facts, not fantasy or someone's OPINION slathered over facts, and as far as I'm concerned, this describes ALL of Thrapp's works which I have read to date. He was not present during any of the events he writes about, and therefore he has little to nothing important to say about them. Other sources containing actual accounts from people of those times stand as true monuments of historic record. Read those, reject Thrapp's! 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 This man is so bad ! anyway is your choice  
 I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  : 
 I settled down to read this book, hoping I would find a stimulating rejoinder to Richard Noll's work, and was disappointed. If this is the best critique of Noll that the Jungians can muster, then the Jungian community  is in deep, deep trouble. Shamdasani detests Noll -- and that is the only  fact one learns after reading this short book. I wasted my money buying it.  I would urge others to pass on this one and wait for more sophistated works  of Jung criticism to appear 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.    First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.      I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless.    I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully.    I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here.    1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing.    2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh! This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning.  My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!!  My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks.  Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right.  One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead.  I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway. 
 The title 'Wake of Death,' new film of Jean-Claude Van Damme, is rightly given to the very violent contents.  Van Damme plays a bouncer Ben Archer who is quitting his job after seeing what he doesn't want to see for 20 years.  But he has a beautiful wife Cynthia (Lisa King, 'Home Alone 4') and a kid at home, and all he wants is just a quiet life.  Anyone who knows some rules about action flicks will detect what will happen to his family when kind-hearted Cynthia (who is an INS officer by the way) takes home a little Chinese girl found among the refugees from China.  And the little girl is connected with a Chinese triad, in fact, a daughter of a ruthless boss Sun Quan (Simon Yam, 'Tomb Raider 2').  And these events occur at the night when Cynthia and Ben are sleeping together in bed, showing part of their bodies in the ill-lit room.  [TYPICAL REVENGE STORY] Yes, Van Damme is getting more and more serious these days, as you have seen 'In Hell' recently.  'Wake of Death' goes similar course, but this time it's a revenge story with more violent actions with shoot-outs and car-chases.  Though the script is a standard one, one inventiveness is found in the relations between Van Damme's hero and his former associates French mafiosos.  These French gangsters give a timely help or two to Van Damme's character in a more bloody fashion than the Italian guys who were seen helping Arnie in 'Eraser.'  So how good is this film?  It depends on your expectaions.  'Wake of Death' shows fairly good car stunts and shoot-outs, but the lack of imagination on the director's side is too obvious.  My opinion is, it is much better than 'Derailed' (his worst), far below 'Timecop' (arguably his best), on par with 'The Order.'  But it's just my idea.  The point is, Van Damme shows pretty good acting here, but the actions, or the logics behind them, look awfully disjointed.  The bad guy's motive to bring back his daughter at any cost is never explained, and the relations between the characters are very confusing.  (Case in point.  You get a glimpse of two veteran actors Burt Kwouk, 'Cato' of 'Rerurn of Pink Panther' and Jacqui Chan, 'The World of Susie Wong,' but the moment they appear on the screen, they get killed, without leaving no impression on us.)  But  most damaging thing is the film's shoddy editing that virtually killed some of the good stunts such as two motorcycles running in a shoppoing mall.  I still do not know what happened at certain point of the story.  Philip Martinez, formerly producer of B action films such as 'Dot Kill' or 'House of 9,' gives his second film as director.  (Incidentally, his first feature was, the imdb   says, 'Citizen Verdict'(03) starring Armand Assante and Jerry Springer!)  As to 'Wake of Death' he decided to shoot this film in South Africa though the story is set in America.  Fans of Van Damme might hail the film as his come-back.  I don't know, for I still fondly remember joyful thrills when I watched his 'Timecop' or 'Universal Soldiers.'  'Wake of Death' is good as Grade-B, straight-to-video actioner, but it's not good enough for me.          
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 Almost bought this in the store until I noticed there were case studies for both Win2K and WinXP. These are very similar operating systems and, sure enough, the text for the chapters is exactly the same for most of these two chapters. I do not understand why  interesting operating systems [FreeBSD, Mach] were left online in order that these two redundant chapters could be printed. Were it not for my familiarity with previous editions, I would assume the authors knew very little about OS concepts if they thought that covering 2K and XP would provide two distinct case studies for comparison. In short, the 2K coverage should have been replaced by one of the online chapters 
 The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be "Moving Pictures".   Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to. 
 I found this book too much focused on "Mission statements" "values" and "vision", which I would expect is your entrepreneural common sense. It includes very little about actually preparing statements or plans. There is only one sample plan at the end for a winery. I didn't find any information on approaching investors.  I returned this book and bought Nolo's book instead 
 I collect historical etiquette books, and have contributed more than one to Project Gutenberg's collection.  This will not tell you how to hold a dinner or ball, nor how to conduct oneself at either, nor will it tell you what gentlemen do, which an etiquette book should do. Instead, like most deportment books, it is addressed only to the female sex on the matter of dressing modestly and sensibly, and keeping oneself both healthy and educated, while dangling the carrot of a Good Marriage for all that trouble.  Having read it once, I find no reason to read it a second time. It is the same female modesty line reiterated over the previous and following century, without anything notably "of the period." It is certainly no guide to how visits, entertainments, or anything else of the Regency were conducted. Details change over time, as I have learned in reading my collection of books: what is fashion one decade is vulgarity the next. If that is what you were hoping for (as I was), we need to continue looking 
 Kevin Trudeau leads his readers into believing they will get the solutions they are looking for but when the time for presenting them comes, he sends his readers to his website where they have to pay an outrageous membership fee. He condemns those who are out to make money at our expense then turns around does the same thing.  I give it two stars because there is some knowledge to be gained but no solution unless you are willing to pay.  A big disappointment 
 Sadly, this is just a waste of your money. I can't think of anything nice to say about it. It's sad that a man who has recorded several albums of his own plus numerous hit singles  finds the need to sing songs which his brother, Barry, made famous. I was deeply upset to see that he even recorded Barry's signature song "Words".   Robin has a voice of his own and should try to sing songs fitted for his voice. He needs to step back and realize that one person does not make a Bee Gees. It required all three of them to create the magic.   
 there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was "well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future" it was too focused on that ...I liked "Stranger In a Strange Land" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page. 
 For all those people out there that are required to purchase this book for a class in undergraduate level psychology, you had better get ready for a rough ride. This book is an extremely difficult one to read. It is very complex with deep concentrated reading necessary in order to comprehend half of what is being presented. The flow of the book is extremely poor, constatnly jumping around from one topic to another without any decent segues. The case studies presented are extremely outdated and do not help much in understanding the topics being discussed. They are not explained well enough to show the relevance of the case study, and they are not tied into the discussion and used effectively at all. This is a poorly constructed book that will frustrate more readers than it will help 
 This book talks about accounting in a limited way. Whereas it says that it aims to present accounting to the reader regardless of his/her background, the book certainly fails to do so. Organization of information is poorly  executed, and lack of depth and non-randomization of scenarios make the  readers' perspective quite limited 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 This book really puts into perspective the way Disney handles its affairs, especially relating to merchandising their name.  I appreciate Carl Hiaasen's humor and point of view.  And he is right when he points out that people tend to trust the Disney name no matter what 
 I honestly can't believe that Robert Patrick wasted his time on this piece of [junk] movie.  Ugh!  One of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while 
 This is a plodding biography that has some decent content on MacFarlane's involvement with the Stratmeyer Syndicate and his authoring of the Hardy Boys. However, there's a lot of tedious material to get through for a few interesting parts 
 The entire first half is devoted to physical beauty as it was viewed in the 50's 
 I bought this book sight unseen as a present for my niece, but gave it away to a local charity instead.  Much of the material is out of date (it predates the fall of the Soviet Union, and the explosion of archaeological discovery that has happened since then in Central Asia), and the book itself is poorly produced --- the printing is fuzzy, and many of the images look like third-generation photocopies 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love 
 I'm new to the Military Sci/Fi genre and I had been reading a lot of good things about David Drakes' writing. In essence I got interested after reading Cornwells' Sharpe Series and the Prince Roger series by David Weber/John Ringo.  I read a review where someone said they stopped at page 171 and put the book down. Well they're better than me, I've struggled to get to page 126, then decided to stop at and write this review.  After seeing so many references to Drake as being 'the man' in Military Sci/Fi I finally decided to pick up one of his books.   I tried to read "Birds of Prey" also by Drake and could not even finish it. I thought maybe it was the premise. I think I like to see the story of someone growing into a command position, i.e. Richard Sharpe (Sharpe Series) and Roger McLintock (Prince Roger Series). However, that was not the problem.  After a day of reading "Birds of Prey" I realized I had made a mistake and exchanged it for this book [Ranks of Bronze], since this is supposed to be the story of a 'group' and how one character goes from being a "raw kid" to a "leader of men". Well I see now that it was NOT the premise, it is his writing style.  Even in "Birds of Prey" I noticed that his style is...hard to follow. It doesn't flow smoothly. In this book as well, it just reads...bad. I have one more Drake book "Grimmer Than Hell". However, if it reads anything like the first two I've read, it will be the last Drake book I read.  I don't know if Bernard Cornwells' (Sharpe Series) is considered Sci/Fi, Alternative History, or just simple Fiction. What I do know is regardless of which one was written first; Cornwell reads better, the battles are easy to follow, they're action packed, and they seem to be what Drake is/was trying to achieve.  Lastly, if you want a better written, in my opinion, story that involves essentially the same plot try David Webers "Excalibur Alternative" 
 I had read Cahill's other three "Hinges of History" titles before I read this one.  In comparison with the other three books, "Sailing the Wine Dark Seas" seems less planned and less insightful.  Cahill never really establishes a solid link between the Greek world and our own.  This is not to say that he does not explain Greek contributions to art, theater, and philosophy.  However, at the end of the reading Cahill left me unconvinced that the Greeks were that important in the shaping of the modern world.  Of course, the Greeks did make significant, lasting contributions.  Cahill simply does a poor job of making the connections seem important.    If you are going to read a Cahill book, I recommend "How the Irish Saved Civilization." 
 I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet.  After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be "banned from the universe" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not "Playboy" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY. 
 This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time 
 I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).  I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)  My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.  The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.  After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.  So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.  
 This book DOES provide enough information to build pro loudspeakers.  There is good coverage of pro loudspeaker construction, so if you want to know how to build a box, this is the book for you.  When it comes to design, this book is very lacking.  There is a fair section on cross over design (1st & 2nd order only).  But when it comes to enclosure design, the author suggests the reader use speaker design software (not provided) with no guidance on what these programs do.  Nice!  The book does a great job of emphasizing frequency response and efficiency matching, but some of the design examples are are a little unorthodox.  Specifically, there is a 12" PA speaker design where the author recommends a 6dB cross over point of 4kHz.  This may protect the horn, but sacrifices off axis frequency response.  Most commercial 12" PA speakers will use a lower cross over point ~ 2kHz and use a 2nd or 3rd order cross over.  Bottom line, if you want to know how to build boxes, this is a good book.  If you want to know how to design enclosures, you will need another book or software.  I rated this book low because the title "Design and Build . . ." suggested to me that there would be better design guidelines.  So while I rated this book one star, other readers may find this a useful reference for pro speaker construction. 
 In GOOD ADVICE, director Steve Rash presents a view of upper class urban life that is supposed to be funny in a slapstick sort of way but quickly enough morphs into the world of fairy tales that is unified only by the most unlikely concatenations of events. Charley Sheen reprises his WALL STREET role as an upward bound stock broker who, in this film, has learned that humor can be the leavening agent to success that was denied him by his earlier confrontations with Gordon Gekko. Sheen has a live in girlfriend (Denise Richards) who comes across as exactly the sort of blonde bimbo airhead who has little success as a girlfriend and less as a lonelyhearts advice columnist. Richards dumps Sheen because he has lost his job in a manner that draws uncomfortable dramatic parallels with his previous WALL STREET role. He becomes boozy, depressed, and frankly not a little pathetic in his slovenliness. After Richards exits for Brazil, Sheen needs a job. Then he gets a bright idea. Why not take over hers? First, he must convince Richards' boss (Angie Harmon), who can't make up her mind whether to toss Sheen out of her office or into her bed. At this point, GOOD ADVICE has already crossed the line into a Drew Barrymore fairy tale where things and events always break exactly right for all concerned. I kept waiting for reality to intrude. When Harmon pays Sheen with a paycheck for his columns that she thinks Richards is writing, I wondered when he would ask her to write the check in his own name since he could not cash checks in Richards' name. Jon Lovitz and Roseanna Arquette are only props for Sheen to bounce off of. Estelle Harris is more amusing as an oversexed septuagenerian who saves the day. Not for one moment did I accept the plot premise that Angie Harmon might not fall for the manly charms of Charley Sheen, but then again, in light fluffy romantic comedies like GOOD ADVICE, all that is required to maintain viewer interest is for the cast to pretend that they like each other, or failing that, hate each other. GOOD ADVICE does the former to such an extent that the lack of the latter is hardly noticed. It is not likely that one would want to view GOOD ADVICE more than once. Take my good advice for what it is worth 
 This was a total waste of money.  The "Aloha" set was great, but this one was a major disappointment.  One entire DVD was nothing but re-takes and out-takes, the same thing over and over.  It could have all been scaled down on one DVD and been much more interesting.  We are big Elvis fans, just went to Graceland on our anniversary.  Elvis was a great entertainer and this is an insult to his fans for paying so much money to be bored!  Elvis was never boring!!!  This was marketed to get you to buy it, DON'T!  Save your money 
 I liked the book well enough to read past the first 100 pages, and I did enjoy the Scholar's Tale, but beyond that this book really failed to satisfy.  I don't want to give away any details, but I will say that all of the excitement and mystery surrounding the Shrike is NOT satisfied at all by the end of this book.  Presumably it's wrapped in in the next book but I found myself not interested in slogging through more of Simmons's half-baked plot to reach satisfaction.  I felt cheated 
 I was excited to receive these Pants, Expensive for the quality and They ran way Too Large ,even after a good wash & dry - the Return Policy States that they must be returned without washing , I have to have them Altered which ads more to the cost! I would like to have had them returned for a smaller size -I am a 4-6 so I went with the small , I was going by the size chart , I needed an  extra Small ,beware the sizes run Larger . At any rate I now own them and I am sure that after modifications they will last a long time -the fit  does not look at all like the Models fit on screen.She must be wearing an extra small.I am Disappointed , especially by thinking they would have a nicer fit then they actually had. They look Sloppy on - not Sexy or stylish. they will be Used for Yardwork only 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 I hated this book.  I thought it would be funny, and I wanted to read something that wasn't the typical.... but the author's take on everything is so negative that I couldn't stand to read it.  She indicates you're doomed to get fat, your doomed to be uncomfortable, you're doomed to have an idiot spouse/partner, etc.  People like this author give pregnancy a bad name.  Yes, it has its moments of being uncomfortable, icky, etc., and if you choose to focus on all that, like this author does, you'll also be miserable.  I chose not to be 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 What ever happened to common sense? In this book the average American doesn't exist. I am not denying the problems that exist in the inner cities. I am denying that this is life for the average American or even the average non-white American. Comparing two extremes - best case vs. worst case is always going to give you an unrealistic picture. We live in a capitalist economy, there will always be haves and have-nots. What he is pushing for is a socialist or communist system where everyone is equally miserable and those that manage to get ahead are then forced to pay the way for those who can't or won't. Hey Mr. Kozol - last time I checked there was no army on the borders of Camden or East St. Louis keeping people from moving out, and there is noone forcing anyone to accept the lifestyle they were born into. He offers a view of the problems with no real solution except maybe to hate the rich - Mr. Kozol, how much money did you get paid to write this book?? Utter liberal garbage. Conveniently leaves most of American schools totally out of the equation, only focusing on the worst cases and then comparing them to the top schools in the nation. 
 There was no "0 star" to rate this book. Someone wrote your innane comments were "South Park" but that was giving you more credit than due.  This book knocks rooms decorated with "mod," "hippy," "psychedelic," primary, analogous, complementary, or accented neutral colors; functional autonomous rooms combining sports, hobbies, recreation, and academic dimensions within one room; it knocks the budget-conscious decorations of the handmade, handpainted, functional, antique, dime store, yard sale, thrift or expensive furniture stores; it slams grouped wall, shelf decorations used as room accents: keys, Americana cushions, books, candle holders, fruit in a bowl, potted plants; criticizes large eye-catching "centers of interest" used with living room furniture, sun face wall painting, "Abe Lincoln with butterfly bowtie," large eye over purple tub; the accented neutral black/white/yellow bedroom with Colonial style poster bed, Queen Anne chair, rocking chair, possibly Ethan Allen, round table may be possibly an old wooden construction cable spool covered with home sewn tablecloth; cubist, geometric, fractal wall decorations; use of light through uncovered windows, sheer curtains, roll-up wooden blinds, tie-back sheer curtains; and repainting an antique chair to accent a child's room.  I would not purchase nor recommend this book nor anything else written by this author.    
 Do we have to look back with such nondiscerning compassion? My friend gave me a copy of this, and it was a mild listen at best. But you have to remember the technology of the time - imagine what John Cage would have done with todays computers and software!! So if you want a museum peice, then drop the bread on this trip back in time. --O, and don't give me that s#$# about timeless music as Richard heavily relies on contemporary tech tools. j 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 Some artists slowly insinuate themselves into your psyche, requiring repeated listenings while their songs to percolate around in your brain.  Not so Amanda Marshall.  Her songs and her vocals, abetted by big label production, come out swingin' for the fence.  Her voice has the flexibility to go from soulful shouting to soulful warbling.  Her lyrics are just as forthright.  For my taste, it's all a bit too strident, too 'out front'.  I prefer the artists that hold something back, that don't tell you everything, the ones that leave some mystery that compels you to play the songs again.  Marshall has more immediate appeal, but one that wears thin sooner 
 i love anna quindlen, i love literature, i love landscapes of the imagination, and i love london, so i was ready to love this book.  however, it didn't give me nearly the depth i wanted.  the essays are oddly generic, the comments oddly superficial.  i was left with little impression, literary or geographical.  i'm sad 
 I ordered this, and it is just basically just a mini sewing dictionary.  It gives terms and defines them.. and recommends what you should have in a sewing box... no real details on how to sew. The only nice part is the project cards that it comes with. If you are wanting to LEARN to sew and learn different techniques... this isn't what you should get. Disapointing 
 Interesting book, worth the read. Definitely take the time to read the Rich Dad serie 
 Hoffman's recipes sound delicious, but in fact are often flavorless. If you use her recipes, you WILL learn slow cooking tecniques (stacking meat in the pot, thickening sauces, etc). But after 7 years of using this book, my notes on the recipes have a continual refrain: "Needs more pizzaz"; "Add vegetables"; "Flavors need more depth". 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 BE doesn't live up to the hype?  Whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished. The court jester doesn't deserve to live.  Not only does BE live up to the hype; BE is the hype.  Common and Kanye reminiscent of Quincy and Michael, the early years.  When Michael was still black and male.  Simply stated, BE flows.  If BE were any tighter we couldn't afford it.  No need to skip or go back. Just enuff songs to make you listen to it again.  Great work of art.  Common and Kanye - damn!!!! 
 The background and recipes are quite good but the paper back book is a disgrace. My copy is less than a year old but nearly every page has separated from the "perfect" binding. The publisher should give a[...]to anyone who has bought this. Five stars for the author, [...], so a two overall 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 There is little grace here. Perhaps the translation into English has casued this, but the book is a hodge-podge of dates and names, the latter often tossed off as if the reader is already famliar with them. There is nearly nothing about the daily lives of the millions of people involved in this long period of human history, as the narrative, what there is of it, flits from decade to decade. A fine example of why many people hate history. Perhaps David McCullogh should turn his gaze toward Rome 
 The fact that as of this writing 20+ copies are available new and used at big discounts might be a warning sign. The big-concept selling point here is that on this album PWR was finally freed to be his highly original self,and played tunes by Ornette Coleman,Coltrane,and Monk (along with his more standard fare). However,on these supposed epochal encounters with the ultra-moderns,he does little more than state the themes as written,with no improvisation at all on two and minimal improvisation on the third. Critics whom I trust praised this highly,and I bought it on their recommendation--my mistake; don't make it 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 This appeared to be a good book for beginners (I'm one!) until I began to have problems running the programs. After a few typographical errors I ran into more difficult problems in chapters 13 and 14 on functions. I first went to Que website to look for a list of errata but there was none. Later I went on line to a c/c++ newsgroup and got help. In the above chapters the functions in the examples should have been prototyped (declared before the main function) but were not. I would have more patience with this book if the publisher made some effort to correct these errors, other publishers do. This book will frustrate beginers rather than enlighten. I would not recommend this book 
 I'd like to review this. However, it's been about six weeks since I ordered it & it hasn't arrived yet 
 I used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely.  Amazon sent a free replacement.  It did the same thing.  I couldn't get it to turn on, then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on I couldn't get it to turn off.  It needs major redesigning.  I like the concept and it was comfortable but that's about all.  Barbara Baxte 
 This is my opinion only. This diet is just to far out there.  For example it wants you to eat Free range eggs but not really Chicken eggs?  Come on.  The average person doesn't have access to eggs that are not from a chicken.   The General idea of the diet is a good one they just go overboard.  Basically it is a low carb diet made more difficult.  You would almost have to be a fanatic to have any luck with this diet.    
 Not a very modern book about 16 years out of date now. is major book about one person's sharpening system and yet it does have a lot of infromation on how to sharpen knives and such.  which is a lot more that almost all the other books sold out there. If you get ripped on other books on "how to sharpen" and want something else get this one  Toma the Old One of "SHARP NOW! company  
 This book take a long time to arrive at any substance on Schemas and is only good for total novices to world of XML Schemas. In-fact the real schema is seen only half way through the book. It definitely is a boring read 
 I have Cabin Fever and Thanks for the ether and a few others and i was really upset. This CD kinda...blew. I mean, The songs aren't very creative like the other ones... and what is up with that little girl singing? The playrites werent as good as Cabin FEvers (the Exclusive Celebrity Double Date). The tune and rhythum was okay, but it really wasn't good. The voice is stronger, but the songs are bad. It didn't catch my ear like CAbin Fever did. I would not reccomend this CD to ANYONE who has heard RAsputina before and new fans. It is not one of there best work 
 Terrible, terrible CD. I got it two day's ago and could not even listen through the whole CD. Regina plays the violin and the music with such bad taste. What a disgrace to the once Paganini's violin. I can't believe I spent my money on this. It should not even have 1 star 
 I thought this would be a great first book for my son since it is a "classic" and all, but the hardbook edition isn't all that fun for baby. Each page has something that the baby can see and touch i.e. he/she can actually "pat the bunny" and feel a sonft, furry bunny. Some pages are just too harsh, for example one page says baby can feel daddy's stubble or something like that, and there's a picture of a man shaving with a piece of sandpaper on his cheek! Needless to say, that page is too harsh for baby's soft skin and he didn't really like that. Other pages tell baby to put his/her finger inside a hole and do some other activities which are just bland. And the colors throughout the book are rather pale. Baby likes a lot of his other books with more mirrors and colors, and books that are soft so he can eat them 
 This is an OK CD. Not one of his better efforts. The best song on this CD, Boats To Build was of course not written by Jerry Jeff but by Guy Clark. It is very dissapointing to see Jerry Jeff's lack of original songwriting in recent years. His best stuff has always been songs not written by him but atleast he used to write a decent song once in awhil 
 First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract.   My conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics.   As others have said in this review forum. This book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing.   This book has a few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent.   Dont waste your money or time. I am so happy I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale! 
 I was shocked at how bad this CD was. I absolutely loved Mars & Venus so I tried this one. First off he is just talking in a monotone voice that is very boring. It's impossible not to think about other stuff. He doesn't give any useful information, just dances around stuff leaving you confused. The meditation stuff was so lame I about quit right in the middle of the program. Gray struck gold with Mars & Venus but I'm afraid with Get What You Want he struck rock bottom 
 THE EVIL THAT MEN DO Nancy Holder (2000)  RATING:  2/5 Stakes  SETTING:  Season Three  CAST APPEARANCES:  Buffy, Joyce, Willow, Oz, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia, Willy the Snitch, Devon, Sheila Rosenberg, Ira Rosenberg  MAJOR ORIGINAL CHARACTERS:  Helen, Julian (ancient Roman vampires); Jordan Smythe (flunky); Mark Dellasandra (high schooler); Nick Daniels (Bronze manager); Claire Bellamy (Bronze); Diana (ancient Roman Slayer)  BACK-OF-THE-BOOK SUMMARY:  "After a vicious shooting spree, the town of Sunnydale is shell-shocked.  What could have sparked the random rampage?  Buffy Summers can guess.  Considering the prophetic dreams she's been having, the Slayer suspects possession by an especially malevolent force.  As the police follow their typical false leads, the Slayerettes start up their own research into possible paranormal causes.  But when Oz's van is discovered on the side of the road, minus one teen wolf, a distraught Willow turns on Buffy, disrupting the investigation.  With the pressure in Sunnydale mounting, the residents' reactions to stress grow increasingly unpredictable.  The Slayer continues her search for answers, narrowly surviving an attack by a well-trained and powerful vampire who brought a gruesome death to every Slayer who crossed her path.  Is this the ancient creature behind the recent influx of evil?  Or is there another influence . . . close to home?"  REVIEW  	Set-Up:  What do you get when you mix Nancy Holder, two ancient Roman vampires, and a plot to raise an ancient deity to destroy the world?  Punchline:  An incredibly boring Buffy novel titled The Evil That Men Do.  I perhaps shouldn't be quite so harsh, as there is one or two good ideas in the novel, it's just that on the whole the book lacks energy, humor, surprises, creativity, and all of those other things one looks for in a good novel. 	Helen and Julian, two vampires from the age of Caligula, have waited several centuries for a chance to call forth the goddess Meter and rule the world.  When they hatch their vile scheme in Sunnydale, the water supply gets laced with an "everyone turn evil" drug, turning citizen against citizen as "all hell breaks loose."  Seriously . . .  it's just plain bad. 	Our Terrible Twosome of bad guys have standard villain personas:  Julian is the suave, cultured, smarmy James Bond movie villain, while Helen is the vicious, want-to-kill-everything-that-moves type of villain.  Their backstory is fairly interesting, even if it takes a while to get moving.  As for the Scoobies, they're all fulfilling their standard roles:  Cordelia gets kidnapped, Oz shapechanges, Buffy stakes.  The book just doesn't have much life to it, and should be avoided in favor of the many better ones out there.  [... 
 very bad quality, not worth to buy it. it is not as good as the picture. Don't buy it!! 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 I found the book "A Gathering of Days" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me. 
 This books is clearly nothing less than pseudo-scientific claptrap.  It is however certainly worth the read.    Of interest only in light of its place in history and its influence on the Nazis, Wagner, etc.    Gobineau makes the same foolish errors common to those who THINK they are applying the scientific method and his errors simply multiply; he stops only when he is convinced he has proved a premise he already believed true.   This is like a text book of phrenology or animal magnetism.  What amazes and saddens me is (looking at the other reviews) how many modern readers are considering this as worthy of serious consideration.   I'm assuming they have appointments to get the bumps on their heads read by a phrenologist soon too! 
 People who did this atlas wanted to cut their job and limited the Eastern Europe by deviding it by two parts. One and very big part of the Eastern Europe is not in the Historical Atlas. The biggest European countries such as Ukraine and Russia as well as other countries - Baltic states, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, etc. are not concidered to be Europe in so called Historical Atlas of the Eastern Europe. I would reccomend the authors to get some geography lessons before making any other job.. 
 Not only is this book so murkily written that it borders on unreadable,  but the author offers not a shred of concrete evidence to support his  paranoid fantasy--that the CIA was behind the death of every one of the  above-mentioned rock stars. This is trash fiction masquerading as  investigative journalism 
 I was extremely excited about reading my first Ian McEwan book but was sorely disappointed.  The married couple in this book, Clarissa and Joe are portrayed as having a very close, very connected, loving and bonded relationship in the first few chapters of the book. Within twenty-four hours of a tragic accident, Clarissa is suddenlty accusing her husband of being delusional and dishonest. Joe, as we've been told, is an extremely stable, methodical research scientist without a hint of a troubled mental health history.  So why the sudden mistrust? I hoped that perhaps this would be explained to me as I read further but alas, it just becomes more ridiculous and unbelievable as the pages turn.  Clarissa finally ends her relationship with Joe, at least temporarily.  This is after there is irrefutable evidence that Joe has been sane from the very beginning.  Still, apparently, she perceives him as "cutting her out" and going it alone, despite the fact he spends most of the book trying to communicate his concerns to her.  I am so baffled. What was this book really about 
 This is a piece of junk--don't bother. when I originally ordered thought it was Bally's with the Balls at the end. This is just rope with pulleys. Not even elasticized. And really, when you return and have to pay postage, you are paying for the item and getting nothing 
 There is very little to no new information in this book that is not available online.  Check out http://www.tivocommunity.com.  If you are good enough to do an upgrade/hack you are good enough to find the information on your own 
 I have been a Beatles fan since 1964, and I have distinct memories of the band's influence on my young life.  I saw Hard Day's Night, Help!, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be in the theater when they were first released.  This film has always been the Holy Grail of Beatle fandom.  Now that I own it, I can honestly say I understand why it took so long to release it to the public.  That thirty years of isolation, locked up in a vault somewhere in London, only improved its standing in my imagination, not on actual film.  The BBC was right to bury this.  As a film, or television special, it's horrible.  But as a fan, I had to have it.  Now, that's all I can say about it; I own it.  When will Let It Be be released 
 I am an avid reader and a lover of books.  I will generally read anything cover to cover, whether I am enthralled in the story or forcing my way through the end of an awful yarn.  I couldn't even finish this book.  It was HORRIBLE!  I had prepared myself for a hilarious adventure (such as any of Douglas Adams' books) and instead got a disgusting, boring set of chapters that seem to have been forced onto the page by an immature, high school drama student.  Don't even bother with this book.  You'll be disappointed 
 The sad truth is that the "praise" this book offers is never very interesting.   Sorry.  Love Ginsberg, hate po-biz. 
 Like a drag queen,this movie is melodramatic,wears too much make-up&is over-the-top.Watching this movie before going to work at 4 in the morning,I found this a hoot.(If this movie were in theaters,people would be in tears---from laughing so hard!!)  One of the gems is when Dolly's controlling boyfriend drawls,"A man is supposed to go after the younger ones,not the woooman!" Put on a fake Texas accent&it works.  There's the Sappy Sequence in which Dolly meets with her mother,looks at photographs of herself,then gets a heart-to-heart with her pastor.Awwwwww...Did Thomas Kinkade ever get directing credits?  Of course,one must suspend disbelief when the Handsome Young Guitarist falls for Dolly.For someone somewhere,they're an archetypal couple.I haven't found that someone.The movie has a hilarious love triange,enough melodrama for 10 Lifetime films--and songs to tie in with the plot,no less!It's country-fried soap opera!Come 'an get it 
 The content of the book is good and my 2-year-old son enjoyed the book a lot. Unfortunately the paper is of low strength and is not up to the hard use that young users can dish out 
 The information presented in this book is amazing.  The economics of baseball are hardly talked about.  There are some things that go on behind the scenes that most of us don't know about.  It was fascinating to find out about this, but it got to be too much for me to handle.  I ended up being bored with it in the end and that is why I gave it two stars.  I also disagree with some of Zimbalist's theories on how to reform baseball.  He is not open to any other ways, and I should know since I met him once for a seminar 
 Much like the previous reviewer I urge you not to spend lots of money on HDMI cables. HDMI specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost, therefore there is no reason, no matter what the cable is made of, to spend money on HDMI cables. Search the internet, you can find plenty of good 10ft HDMI cables for $10 or less. Digital is zeroes and ones. In HDMI's case, either the cable is connected or it isn't 
 This man obviously knows nothing about human behavior. Most people know that just because someone can't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest. In more cases than not, they simply have low self-esteem are very self-conscious, and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or I might do when asked to do improv. This man himself is a manipulator, and a liar. He's manipulating you to get this book,  taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience. Lying and "hypnotizing" people in order to get the truth out of them, is far less effective than being honest yourself. If you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars. You will start to have an understanding of people's energies if you just pay attention 
 This book is more geared towards the beginner, though even beginners need to have basic meanings to base their ideas on which this book fails to deliver. In its chapters it refers to reading material to research ie other books on the subject that pertain to the chapters teachings.    The whole point of buying this book is so you dont have to buy any others otherwise you would have bought them instead!  This book promises so much and delivers very little!  A very disapointing book, better introductory and advanced books are available! 
 This book was not good at all. It didn't thrill me whatsoever. It wasn't amazingly clever or even that interesting. I'm sorry I even read it 
 For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man.  Facts: In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times!  In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie.  Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame.  Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame.       
 I purchased two sets of these speakers for the Kid's Room at my company.  Each set worked as a receiver rather than speakers, picking up AM radio waves.  The reception was GREAT!  But I believe the children would rather hear what is playing on the computer instead of the Mexican music coming through the speakers 
 I do not know what all these 5 star reviews are raving about.  I didn't like this book for several reasons.  They are, in no particular order: It's about too many people and not one of them gets a thorough development--it's just snipets of lots of people's lives.  It's only about women--how boring!  The men in the book are in the background and hardly even named.  This means only mother-daughter relationships are discussed, and it makes for pretty monotonous fare by the end of the book.  Finally, the theme of rebellion against old world culture has potential, but the author gives it a very one-dimensional treatment.  Simply move away from home and drink too much and you're saying something new and different about living in the American melting pot?  In short, I though this book was shallow.  I wouldn't have finished it if not for the book group I read it for 
 This book is just a memoir. One should not look beyond that. If you are interested in Azadeh's opinions about Iran, you may get something out of this book. It has no social, political, or historical value based on research. It is just a young woman's struggle to deal with issues of growing up. 
 Looks like Robert Sabbag couldn't let his sucess with Snowblind be.  This book just sucks.  I know Allen Long and his story is true, the smuggling, the four years as someones maid in prison but Robert Sabbag just got sloppy with this one.  He tried to take a mediocre story and make it into something interesting; didn't work 
 Very disappointed with this. It's old and tired. Neither Sara nor Maybelle have their heart in this one, no sparkle, no soul, no fire. Really not worth the purchase 
 This unit has all marketing features, Date, Time,  Memory stores up to 48 prior readings by date & time, but there is one problem its not acurate. My Doctor said Wrist Cuffs can be -10% off just because of taking the reading at the wrist and not on the arm next to the heart, just like taking your bp on the right arm. The further from you heart the lower your readings. Example: The doctor takes my BP then I take it with the cuff monitor  He/she sys its 110/56 54 beats/min where this one reads 151/93 60 beats/min. We tried it several times and each time it was incorrect. So he told me not to use it.  I bought a simular unit, no date, time on the screen, but stores 99 prior readings, tested again with the doctor's nurse and found it to be within limits. She said you never get the same reading twice in a row. Some nurses & doctor's even take three readings and take the average. 
    A Virtuous Woman is a book by Kaye Gibbons and is about a woman named Ruby Pitt who meets a guy named Jack Stokes one day when he spots her sitting at a picnic table. She was much younger than he was and was raised much differently than he was.Ruby was a widow but ends up married to jack.Jack was so in love with his wife through everything they went through even when she was diagnosed with cancer.They were opposites and when Ruby dies Jack is lost without her.They seemed to have an unusual relationship in my opinion. It was actually really hard for me to keep reading each page as i went on.It just wasnt a story that kept me wanting more!and that is why i gave it only 2 stars. i didnt even want to finish the book and that is why i think it took me so long to read it.It really dissapointed me seeing as how i loved Kaye Gibbons first novel, ELLEN FOSTER.i think that another reason i didnt enjoy the book is that there were too many characters to keep track of and it made the book a bit confusing.i really didnt like the transition of chapters either. it was a bit unorganized.There was no action in this novel and i'm sad to say that i dont reccommend it to anyone really 
 My husband and I tried using this book and it's methods for almost a year with not even a hint at conception. The author's "frank" opinion about trying to conceive after 35 is negative and discouraging. I refused to believe that I was infertile but because I am over 35, it was very difficult to determine my fertile window using these methods. It caused undo stress and anxiety and my husband and I finally broke down and spent the money to purchase an OVwatch. We conceived the first time using the watch. I am not trying to plug them for any reason other than it works. We conceived twice using the watch after a year of frustration and depression. They are the most decent, supportive, positive customer service oriented company I have ever encountered. I found Terri Weshcler to be incredibly negative and judgemental of women trying to conceive at a later age-and the last thing you need is another seed of negativity when you're trying to conceive 
 This movie is by far the worse of the Urban Legends movies. This is another movie I purchased without renting it first. Had I rented it first, I would not have bought this movie even though I did save money by buying it previously viewed. A group of high school friends start talking about the legend of Bloody Mary. Chanting her name will make her rise from the dead! Oh Boy. The whole movie boils down to the fact that Mary was murdered many years ago and her body put away where no one would ever find it. When Mary comes back to life, she seeks revenge on fellow classmates and kills them off. Not a good horror movie. No gore, no suspense. I would definetly recommend anyone rent this movie before buying it 
 While this is an attractive volume, well-printed andwell-bound, and does include a nice selection of Lovecraft's best, Iwould not recommend it.  I really enjoyed Ms. Oates' notes in the front of the front of the book: interesting and well-written, so what's my problem? She provides synopses of the stories, giving away the plot and ending. What fun is it to read a novel, when you've been told the ending in advance 
 I have studied,  practiced and taught managerial accounting for more than 17 years at work, using excellent supporting text and case books from recognized US authors. But to be honest Dr. Kaplan is making easy concepts to appear complicated and cumbersome. His case readings as well as the text materials are very length and hard to "digest" since it does not capture the attention of the reader.I would not recommend the book neither for and undergraduate or graduate degree, despite the well known and worldwide recognition of Dr. Kaplan. His book is far from being pedagogical in nature 
 I tried it in a cd player dvd player computer came up blank now i've givin up  this is the first time this has happen 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 This is like the music to one of those theme park Celebrate America type shows. The musical arrangements have that hokey, somewhat dated, overly sweet and enthusiatic feel I hate. I thought I was getting the standard versions of these songs but what I got was the cruise ship extravaganza, yuck 
  "Nothing's okay," Westgate Penitentiary inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) says, "I gotta get out."  That's because the sadistic screws are keeping the otherwise tractable inmates down with BRUTE FORCE.  You treat a man like an animal and he turns into one, right?   At least so sayeth the usually reliable director Jules Dassin in this overripe movie about a prison on the edge of explosion.  You see, the bad guys - the inmates - have a backstory, told in a series of flashbacks, that proves they're good guys under the prison grays.  They just got hooked up with bad women who made them do bad things.  Flashbacks don't lie.  They don't necessarily entertain, or keep a movie chugging onward at a comfortable clip, but they don't lie.  The prison officials, on the other hand... the otherwise decent warden is weak and vacillating.  The avuncular doctor drowns his reprehension in brandy, emerging from his alcoholic stupor  periodically to crack wry about the inhumanity of it all.   The baddest good guy is Capt. Munsey (`Sir' to you), Hume Cronyn, an effete sociopath with a blood taste for dishing it out (he seems particularly fond of whips) and a penchant for the insinuating seduction.     I wanted to like it, but as BRUTE FORCE plodded forward, piling melodramatic excess on melodramatic excess, I found myself fighting it.  Fighting the notion that everyone in effective authority was a heartless goon, the ineffective ones were broken (presumably by the ruthless System), and the inmates were misunderstood choirboys.  Despite its good looks, good performances and exciting final scene I had too many "Aw, c'mon" moments to honestly say I liked this movie.     The transfer print is in good condition, and the disk includes a hands-free Stills Pressbook Gallery with a number of behind-the-scene photographs, publicity stills, lobby cards and posters. 
 Rising Sun was a terrible read.  Crichton uses one device throughout:  the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him.  It's tiring and monotonous.  Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures. 
 This was one of the few books I just could not get through. Managed about 2/3 and just gave up. At least to the point where I called it quits, the plot was just goofy. 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.  Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.  This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.     One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.  In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
 She took all of this from other authors. Even her section of how to eat chocolate is strangely reminisant of Will Clower's (The Fat Fallacy) Chocolate Eating Lessons concept.  She makes umpteen references to the French and how they eat -- which I am sure she got from French Women Don't Get Fat.  She isn't sure which book she is writing - her Wear More Cashmere book or this one. This book has a few too many references to the Cashmere book not to feel like an advertisement for it. The exercise portion isn't very practical -- unless you have a pool, a dance partner, fencing studio or horse stabled nearby. She talks about her old money upbringing enough to be tiresome...and so you just know that she has never had to try to fit exercise around a full time job.        She has some good ideas but unfortunaltey they are someone else's. 
 This book has no depth to it, no feeling or connection to feeling of any period of their life.  It is juvenile and infantile.If you want a true discovery of who this person is/was, this does not make it!  
 Like many autobiographies,  this book is best before Handy becomes WC Handy the great and venerated music composer and publisher.  Handy describes coming up in the hard world of the South in the years that Reconstruction was being demolished and Jim Crow segregation was being imposed.     Handy's childhood decision to become a musician flew in the face of his family's and much of the Black church (Handy's father was a minister) world's view that being a musician of any kind was hardly better than becoming a criminal.   Classically trained in both the violin and the trumpet and in composition and harmony, Handy always looked to the folk music of working class and farming African Americans and to rhythms and music he knew came from Africa as his source of inspiration. In fact, when Handy became a music professor at a Black state-run college in Alabama, he ended up resigning when the administration frowned on his teaching the students to venerate the music their people created.        Handy gives some interesting stories of life in the Black ministrel companies he worked in.  These companies were a focal point of Black entertainment between the civil war and the second world war.  Not only did 19th Century figures like Banjoist Horace Weston, and the early 20th Century dance and comedy men like Bert Williams and Bill Robinson graduate from minstrelsy to Broadway, but 20th century stars like Louis Jordan, Dizzy Gillespie, and Rufus Thomas got their start in minstrel shows.  These shows trained musicians and singers who became the founding stars of blues and Jazz. One such minstrel troupe had Classic Blues Divas Ma Rainey, Clara Smith, and Bessie Smith, all on the same bill.        Handy discusses the danger and persecution Black minstrel companies faced in the Jim-Crow South. The railroad coach his company traveled  in contained secret compartments to hide the Black entertainers from police and lynch mobs as well as places to store firearms for self-defense. Handy tells several stories that make clear that W.C. Handy might never have survived to write the Memphis and St. Louis Blues without the secret compartment or self defense with firearms.         Contrary to popular misconceptions, the blues is not an ancient form of Black musical expression. It arose in the 1890s and early 20th century. Handy grew up in Alabama, lived in Kentucky,  and Mississippi and was headquartered for years in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the big town in the area that produced Charlie Patton, Robert Johnson, Son House, Muddy Waters, and Johnny Lee Hooker, He had heard old time Black banjo and fiddle tunes since childhood.  Yet, he did not hear the blues until the early 20th Century.   He points out that the real "inspiration" for him to incorporate the blues into the music he wrote for his dance band came in a small town in Mississippi where his band played a dance.  The country people demanded that a ragged blues trio of mandolin, guitar, and bass play a few song. As Handy and his band were tired, they welcomed the opportunity to take a break.  However with the three blusicians were finished, the crowd showered more money on them for a few songs than Handy's whole band received for a whole night's work.  Playing for Black dancers, Handy explained how he had to incorporate the blues and other rhythms and music that came from Africa into his music. Then, Handy is always insistence that the  base of his music is working and farming Black folk.  As he enters fame, Handy remains interesting, especially when he explains the way he had to battle swindling and racism when he became a music publisher. He's also pretty adamant about demanding respect for African American entertainers and for song writers and composers as well.  He's a good, friendly and often humorous writer throughout.   
 I came to this film with the attitude of enjoying a bit of ridiculous 'camp'.  Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman sporting Nawlins accents?  I couldn't pass that up.  Well, even with the right attitude coming in, it was at times painful.  Emma's dialect coach should have been shot; Alan did better, at least he sounded like he was aiming at a southern accent, but he tends to drawl a bit anyhow so maybe it was easier for him.  However, Emma and Alan are only supporting characters.  The main characters are not terrible or anything, but really not that compelling.  Oh, the plot.  The film does have a good plot, and it could have been interesting, but nonetheless I found it a bit plodding.  And as others, have noted, the editting is so weak it's comical.  Oh actually there is a quite memorable scene: the cunnilingus scene in a meat locker.  Wow, that was...um...unusual.  Well, Emma and Alan fans will no doubt watch it, but save it for a slow mid-week night.  Actually, any Emma fans with a sense of humor should definitely watch this at some point.  Emma is obviously having a good time, and seeing her dangle a cigarette while tailing on roller blades is something else.  It just you might not want to choose this as a film to watch with friends, unless you want to expose the depths to which you will descend to watch Emma or Alan on the screen.  Addendum: Alan plays a good character here.  It's a nice lite break if you've been working through his films where he often plays morally ambiguous (or not so ambiguous) characters in films that explore difficult themes 
 I bought this to play back old Hi8 tapes so I could transfer them to DVD. However, there is no S-Video out and no stereo out. Video quality was bad: output was noisey and reds were over saturated. I imagine this is because there is no S-Video out. I returned it and have ordered a Sony GV-D200. Hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much. There are some cheaper used options available, e.g. Sony EVO-250 
 The "Register" provides nothing that isn't easily available on NFL dot COM. This is nothing more than a listing of all players and their basic stats.  Perhaps worth about $4, certainly not $19.  It's a shame that STATS, Inc doesn't publish the "Pro Football Handbook" or "The 100-Yard War: Pro Football Revealed" books any more.  Those books were fantastic.  Compared to them the "Register" is nothing more than a waste of paper 
 Guerrilla Warfare: Che Guevara by Ernesto Guevara  Warning this book seems intended to make martyrs  Over the years this book has proved far more useful to mislead potential guerrillas than to educate them.  The handmade weaponry described are ineffective and or failed tools of war. The tactics suggested have led to defeat in the Americas and in Africa. The cause described has never helped the poor and down trodden.  One could readily ponder if the real intent was to make martyrs for the cause of mythical communist paradise. One wonders  how many, aside from the author, died violently because of all the above.          
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 I tried it and I didn't like it.  I'd almost say read my review of the X-files 9th season and just replace any character names and whatnot, but I won't.  As another reviewer stated this show should've ended after seven years.  Through the show's seven year run they had a cohesive  story that kept me coming back every week.  The ga'uld were an origional idea for a villian.  Apothis and Anubis being of course the stand outs.  I still think they should've had a bigger story involving so'car rather then just an episode or two.  Starting with their decision to make the lost city an ancient outpost and put Jack as a general the show just lost everything.  As boring as season 8 was it was still better than this.  When will TV executives get it?  End a show while it's still strong.  Unfortunately they love to milk a show for everything they can get.  I'd like to say props to scifi for canceling it, but they should've done that two years ago.  Of course Jack isn't on this season which adds to the crap that is season nine.  Add in some bad new characters, one of whom tries hard to be Jack it's not even funny, and a rediculous new villian and you have the makings of bad tv.  If they wanted to do this crap they should've created another bad spin off.  I wouldn't of watched it, but a lot of people would.  Oh and that's another thing, what's with all the atlantis references?  I personally don't care what goes on in another galexy on another bad tv show.  The writting has completely gone downhill.  I never finnished the memory altering device episode because ten minutes into it I figured everything except for who killed the girl, and I just don't care.  And what's with having another villian who pose as gods?  If you're going to create a new bad guy at least make them completely different.  Course the main bad guys on atlantis are basically vampires who liik like marolyn manson.  I could go on, but instead I'll just say if you haven't seen this season then just don't bother.  It's not SG1.  You can't take away three main characters over a couple year span, then take away your main bad guy, replace them with lame characters and expect it to work.  It just doesn't 
 I bought this book because i thought the idea was brilliant.....a dude selling all his junk and traveling across country visiting the new owners of his former possessions.    I was extremely disappointed with this book.  I was really hoping to read a chronicle of this guys travels across country meeting the strangers who bought his old possessions and how it changed their lives.  All we get are  quirky ebay descriptions of used junk, and the disappointed customers who bought them....many of whom didn't want to be apart of his project.  I was expecting a contemporary 'On the Road', but all I got was a mini blog about a college student's old junk.  It did inspire me to mail the book across country to a friend who might appreciate it more than I 
 The sizing on this cardigan is way off.  I ordered a women's medium and it looks like a child size large.  The sleeves are about 4" too short and the overall profile is far too small.  To make matters worse, I ordered it as a X-mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and I'm stuck with a bad product 
 This book is a must read for everyone caught up in busyness.  It starts slow and the early chapters might turn off those with deep beliefs in striving to achieve - but read on.  Everyone must set priorities that are realistic and in accord with one's gifts.  Those priorities must (absolutely must) include family, spouse, and spiritual concerns.  Chapters 9 and 10 are where the rubber hit the road for me, and I am using hindsight to make that judgment. Sixty to Eighty hour work weeks don't cut it and put me out of touch with God and family 
 I purchased this based on the numerous reviews here and glowing recommendations elsewhere online, but it has turned out to be the poorest choice and truly the most useless book on drawing I've ever read.  I wish I hadn't ignored the fact that others commented about nearly everything except actual drawing instruction.  I wish my mind had registered the key words analysis and theory in so many others glowing reviews.  If you want to learn to draw, or learn to actually apply lines, mass, tone, balance, proportion, etc. to improve your drawing skills then look elsewhere.  However, if you want to read one author's horribly long winded rambling lectures about how these things influence art, perception, and the psyche then this is the book for you.  This is far more an analysis of drawing as it relates to art than it is a tutorial.  Nearly three hundred pages and you could compress the portions related to applying these ideas to your own drawing down to two dozen pages at most 
 We purchased this book to use in our accelerated curriculum since we have a substantial vocabulary unit connected to Frankenstein.  However, a few days into the book, we are noticing major departures from Mary Shelley's novel.  Kaplan has irresponsibly marketed this book as if it is the original version.  
 I can fix this! This movie never happened. Now we need to make Starship Troopers 2. I will contribute a few bucks. If we all contribute, we can get an actual director to come along, preferably the one from the first movie, get us some big time sponsors, and make us one heck of a Starship Troopers 2! There, I have repaired the terrible tear in all our souls that this fake Starship Troopers 2 caused us all 
 This movie is horrible. I even found the terror that was Jaws: the Revenge better than this. I'll list some of the things that made this movie bad. 1. The acting was horrible 2. the special effect were even worse than the acting 3. The kids were smarter than the adults (thats how you know its a corny kids movie) 4. The jokes fell flat every singal time 5. The script was horrible 6. 95% of the movie you could tell was on a blue screen I know they were targeting this movie for younger audiences but get real I've seen alot of family movies that both kids, teenagers, and adults can enjoy. I felt tortured threw this entire movie. I was Praying that it would end and I could leave. Don't buy this movie. Hell don't even rent it. Its just that bad 
 Nothing in the description indicates that this is heavily abridged. The introduction (after you've purchased the book) actually refers to this version not as translated (no translator is credited) but paraphrased. It is not even partitioned into St. Augustine's original 13 "books," but is instead resectioned with "new" chapter titles. I had to repurchase the book 
 Walpola Rahula's book is simply put, Theravada dogma which pushes the belief that the Buddha taught natthatta, namely, there is no self.  Rahula makes a number of claims about what the Buddha taught which have no basis in original Buddhism.  For example, Rahula gives a confusing account of the Five Aggregates (Pali, khandhas).  He omits any serious discussion of why the Buddha does not identify his own self with the Five Aggregates or why the Buddha always deprecates the Five Aggregates declaring them, for example, to be the Buddhist devil, Mara the Evil One.  It never seems to dawn on Rahula that the Buddha, in his many discourses, is deploying the via negativa (Grk. apophasis) with regard to the Five Aggregates.  The Buddha is really saying that our true self is other than these illusory Five Aggregates; and that we should have a revulsion towards them instead of the self!  This book deserves careful scrutiny.  And let the beginner beware, this book draws a terribly nihilistic conclusion about Buddhism.  It is ironic to note that three months before the Buddha dies he said the following: "My life is fully ripe, my life is at an end, I shall depart from you, I have made a refuge for the self. 
 In the second week of saying Kaddish for my mother, a dear friend mentioned something he learned from this book. So I started to read it. After 40 pages I concluded that this was the single worst book I had ever  read. Other reviewers have invoked the author's pomposity, self-absorption  and smugness that comes through in the text. As an erstwhile professor of  Jewish studies, I found much more troubling the awful tasteless scholarship  - a little bit of this - a little bit of that. Can I say I found the book  revolting? The way W. tells the story of how the Kaddish came to be  instituted in the 12th century made me want to stop saying the prayer and  run out of the synagogue. Early on W. says he prefers not to call the  Jewish house of worship a synagogue. Rather he wants to call it a shul.  Huh? It was downhill from there, believe me. I prefer not to call this a  book. I'd rather just call it a DOA. I'm saying Kaddish for this flop 
 This is awful. Simply awful. The effects on Mighty Joe Young were laughable back in 1998, and looking at them now after seeing the glory that is Peter Jackson's King Kong... no. Just... no. Bill Paxton also needs to be banned from acting. Hell, even CONGO was better than this tripe 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 After an impressive debut in ORCHID BEACH, we meet Holly Barker on her wedding day....a day that is destined to become a fateful day instead of a happy one.   Woods paints a picture of a heroine who seems more interesting in solving the bank robbery than mourning the loss of the man she supposedly wanted to spend the rest of her life with.  In a painfully dreadful narrative, Woods presents us with another variation on the extremist group of fanatics who want to make the US better by getting rid of anyone who isn't white.  Been done so many times before, that it's redundant in this tepid story.  Woods doesn't offer us anything new and the pacing is so slow, it becomes sleep inducing.  Woods also makes the mistake of having Ham, Holly's tough father, carry the weight of the book.  While Ham's an okay guy, he comes across as a Dirk Pitt or superman in this one, and it just didn't work for me.  The ending is also pretty lame, and even the inclusion of Stone Barrington, makes little narrative sense.  A real disappointment; is the third any better?? 
 This book is an uninspiring analysis of Smith's work.  Nobody who has even a cursory knowledge of Smith's writings would be surprised by what Muller has to say.  The basic point that Smith was not a philosopher of unbridled greed is unsurprising.  It is not that the thesis of the book is wrong, but it is simply something that could have been said in an article or less.  Obviously a lot of hard work went into the book, but it is the product of a mediocre mind 
 the perpetrators of this book should be ashamed of themselves!  there is no creature on earth as loveable and inoffensive as the bunny rabbit.  why not a book on cooking the family dog?  outrageous indeed 
 Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't "light reading" or entertaining at all. Be warne 
 This is an unbelievably bad film. Its only redeeming features are the snippets of actual killer Gary Ridgeway's police interviews that are ocassionally spliced into the film's tawdry, fictionalized action scenes. I hadn't known this footage of Gary Ridgeway existed. A documentary consisting only of these interviews would have been infinitely more interesting than this trumped up movie.  The movie doesn't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity. For example, the extremely amateurish actor who plays Ridgeway doesn't match the real Ridgeway's physical description at all. The real Ridgeway was not a "tall, handsome, muscular" fellow. He was shorter, and unassuming-looking. Also, the majority of Ridgeway's victims were not the glamorous, seasoned barroom prostitutes shown here. They were lonely, struggling teenagers whom he picked up along the Seatac Highway.  If you want a better insight into the character of Ridgeway's victims and crimes, read Ann Rule's book, "Green River, Running Red." In any case, avoid this movie mess.  
 This German Dictionary does not have German pronunciation guides.  It has only English pronunciation guides, which is not very useful for an American trying to learn German 
 Janet Evanovich has become a much better writer since writing this book....I prefer her Stefanie Plum series and hope she doesn't give up on them. 
 An embarassingly bad book, unleavened by its unintentional humour. Rushkoffs silly solipsism conflates online and rave cultures into one big happy, zappy, zeitgeist -- which is simplistic to say the least. What¹s  worse, he wraps his first person report on technolibertarians and  neo-shamans in a retro-psychedelic bow, adding what sounds to me like an  uncritical endorsement of drug use. Avoid this book like the plague 
 This book reduces Nietzsche to rhetorical devices and tropes.  Many out of control discussions are on hand, eventuating in nothing worth remembering.  The idea of this book seems to be to reinforce the idea that morality is boring, that no one should find thinking about morality interesting, and that if you just call boring prose dangerous, then it is.  The argument in this book goes all the way back to Paul Valery, Derrida's inspiration, who misunderstood Saussure.  Valery argues that philosophy has all the marks of literature, and so is indistinguishable from it, and so just is more literature -- no different from comic books, grafitti and wedding vows.  But Quine found no marks of science that were not to be found in philosophy, yet philosophy does not reduce to science.  The argument is no better from the side of art.  Philosophy does not reduce to art.  Valery was wrong, and so is the Magnus group 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money 
 These are nice amethyst earrings, nice purple color. However I'm returning them because they're too big for my ears. The basket setting makes them stick out too much. The setting is not very pretty. The gems are set very low into the basket 
 I've gone through so many of these that I have lost count. For someone like myself who reads every night for at least an hour, the light lasts no more than two months. I don't mean the batteries -- I only use the light plugged into an outlet. But it just stops working suddenly after about two months on average. Very flimsy design, I guess. Yet I have continued to buy it because there's nothing else that lets you avoid batteries and is bright enough for a comfortable read. No wonder they don't offer any warranties! But now it looks like there are some other options and I have vowed never to buy this light again 
 I was really disappointed when I read this book.  If you've read the 12 steps of compulsive overeating, then you've pretty much read this book.  It tells you the same thing.  It takes forever to get you to the place where you can create your own meal plan...and what a joke!  There's no way I can stick to something like that.  I would starve too death!    In conclusion, I do NOT recommend buying this book.  It did not help me at all 
 This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work 
 Darwin's work is groundbreaking, describing inborn emotional expression, including descriptions of animals as well as man. The book itself gets 4 stars for originality of concept and thoroughness of observation. The editing of the digital version leaves a lot to be desired, and gets 2 stars. No illustrations were included. None--and there is no warning about this anywhere. The pages were longer than the original version, so "footnotes" can be found at the bottom, middle, or top of a page. Some footnotes run into text, so if you're trying to read text and skip footnotes, sometimes it makes no sense whatsoever until you read a footnote, determine where the text actually started, and then re-read it including all the parts. Sometimes parts of sentences are just left out. This approach can work for a work of fiction, but I won't be buying any more "illustrated" or footnoted nonfiction digital books 
 I hated this book.  I kept reading, hoping to have that "aha" moment where I finally put all the pieces together... but there was not one.  I did not think there was anything remarkable about Alison, and I never really  liked her.  She was wishy-washy, spineless, and settled way too many times during the story.  I felt so sorry for every character in the book.... except for Alison's friends.. Nola and Jess - who were poorly developed.  I found myself flipping back pages/chapters to see if I'd missed something about these random people.  The middle part of the story dragged on and on.... and then in a matter of one or two chapters.. everything was resolved ... but I still felt unresolved since the resolutions were so weak.  
 Dang, Carl, how could you?  Let me start by saying that CH is one of my favorite writers.  His stories aren't necessarily epic in nature but his dialog & characterizations & writing in general are virtually beyond reproach.  Even though his storylines border on slice-of-life rather than edge-of-your-seat thrillers, Hiaasen's writing is typically so good, his books are still extremely entertaining page-turners.  That said, Native Tongue was quite a letdown for me.  Usually I'll finish a book like this in one or two days.  I struggled for almost two weeks to finish it, putting it down at the drop of a hat.  In his defense, this was one of Hiaasen's earlier efforts.  Everything since Native Tongue has been infinitely better.  If you're new to Hiaasen, don't let this book turn you off.  His other works are definitely worth reading 
 Gay Talese's work on his family's journey from Italy to America is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the United States and Italy.  Revolution, social upheaval, racism, and war  color Talese's story from start to finish.  These themes give the tale a  characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places.   In addition, there is a decided social message which the author appears to  be trying to put forth during the entire story.  These perspectives, and  those on Italian history, should be viewed in the context of  interpretations of an Italian American writer and not be taken as those of  traditional native Italian scholars.  Still, the book is in a bold attempt  at telling the story of one family's struggle, on both sides of the  Atlantic, during the social upheaval of the twentieth century 
 This book, like many such collections (especially those that bring together papers from a conference), is tremendously uneven in quality.  There are a few good essays here--and they are by persons who have written illuminating and substantial pieces in the past.  And then there are a lot of weak essays here--pieces which do not get de Beauvoir right or which attempt without success to advance certain themes that are supposed present in her work.  The volume's introduction is especially flawed in this respect--as a piece of intellectual history or contextualization it is not bad (though not original either), but as a piece of philosophy it is . . . well, not philosophical.  Volumes by Arp, Berghoffen, and Bauer measure up very well to this collection 
 After listening to this album it seems Mike Skinner is resting on his laurels. The laurels of a great first album that had a great reception in the UK and abroad.  This doesn't sound like an album that is out to prove the musical skill of the streets. This is punch the clock/satisfy the contract. It may be that as an American I'm not in touch with the current trendy sound in the UK which if this album won so much acclaim, must be stripped down simplified audio with spoken word lyrics. Not the lyrical style that was an anomaly over original beats that was truly the Original Pirate Material.   I think the idea of telling a story sequentially track by track over an album is a good and original idea, but maybe the first priority should have been making good music 
 I have little doubt that Oscar Wilde and Bosie had extraordinary sexual adventures, but one little thing keeps coming back to me: early in this book, the author identifies Ganymede as the Trojan boy whom Zeus abducted and "anally raped."  What was that?  Was there a source for that?  I flipped to the back of the book, and of course there was no source.  It was apparently "just something the author heard on good authority."  I have been involved in gay scholarship for decades and have read dozens of books about Ancient Greece, and this book is absolutely the first place that I have read about Zeus' alleged anal rape of Ganymede.  I will say one thing with absolute certainty: there is no Ancient Greek source which supports the author.  Centuries later, getting into Medieval and Renaissance Europe, there may well have been all sorts of tales about Ganymede.  He had passed into the popular language: men referred to a handsome boy as some other man's "Ganymede," and from this we ultimately get the word "catamite."  But the actions of the Great God Zeus?  He changed himself into an eagle and abducted Ganymede to Mount Olympus to serve as his wine-pourer.  Period.  Now, this one little thing may seem to be just that: one little thing.  But this book about Oscar Wilde is full of details.  And if the author is not trustworthy on the details, then one must wonder about the value of this book.  Not recommended 
 This isn't as good as Spritied Away or Princess Mononoke. It's not a bad film but it didn't capture me as well as the other films did 
 They say all the major characters come back in `Stitch the Movie,' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the hugely popular `Lilo and Stitch.' For me, the original film's most appealing part is, and will be, Lilo and Stitch, one of the most delightful characters Disney created in the last decade. Do we still need Pleakley when we have Stitch? How about Cobra? Or some alien whose name you have forgotten? Do we need them? No, I don't think so.  But `Stitch the Movie' crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour, together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing. The original's idea of `Ohana' or `family' is changed to `cousin' this time, but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice-told story, no longer attractive enough.  What makes us feel short-changed is, however, the lack of music and scenery, the impressive parts of `Lilo and Stitch.' Instead of Elvis songs, they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and TVs like Monty Python and Ed Wood, completely missing the target audiences who would buy this DVD to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer.   Moreover, the charming, water-color Hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic, unimaginative backdrop which is barely OK even by the lower standard of the Disney's cheap sequels.  The only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters. Except that, and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair Lilo and Stitch, `Stitch the Movie' looks like a pilot film for the original. Or perhaps it is. 
 I returned it even though i had to pay to ship it back! Should not be a kids book, it had very few pictures and no color 
 This is a very very difficult toy to maintain. Gravel is extremely difficult to remove and clean without getting the cardboard background wet. After one cleaning the cardboard background gets wet and that's the end of that.  The plastic scratches very easily and pieces of the periscope broke off easily as well. Goldfish need lots of water and this doesn't lend itself to many types of fish.  I have never had such a difficult time trying to maintain the integrity of the toy while trying to keep fish alive and the tank clean as well. NOT recommended at all. Save your money for a "real" tank 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 These covers are not even close to being red.  The are wine or burgundy in color 
 people are very divided on this book, but i wasn't into it. i guess the author is trying to be funny but she is so shallow, petty, and self centered, it seems to me that she wanted a wedding and not a marriage.  last time i checked i enjoy hanging out with my husband, don't really care if he beats me at scrabble, or uses my shampoo.  because those things don't matter.  i guess if the book was funnier or more insightful i could have gotten beyond the whinning.  but when you start the book basically complaining that you went to st. lucia, i can hardly relate. 
   I bought this DVD becuase I really wanted to learn the dance moves in "You Got Served" and was extremely disappointed.  The only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those, I don't know.  The freestlye section at the end is fun to watch, but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video 
 The real title of the book should be "Why does Ziauddin Sardar hate America ?"  While the intention is good, the result is very disappointing. Ziauddin Sardar often heads in the right direction but always ends up mixing everything up by bringing his own biases in the picture. His work is extremely partial and what we call in French "instruction ? charge". He's not trying to be fair and honest, he's trying to bash America at all costs. The second you realize he's not going to acknowledge ANY positive side of the US anywhere in his book, you must conclude his book can only be a lopsided vision of things 
 I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.    Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.    
 This was too much Spence for me. Having met an investigator who worked for  Spence and saw the man behind the fringe, I must say that his public  persona and actual self seem to differ substantially. After learning some  of the information that will never be written -- at least not by Spence --  I lost much of my desire to read his crafted memoir 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 It's a good book it just askes me as a student to assume too much.  Some of the problems at the end of the chapters are incomplete.  If i was to go about my life as a ME assuming random stuff i would get sued to a point of non-existance.  This book does not teach good engineering practices 
 I have two of these chargers that I bought directly from Kodak for about $10 each. Each of them came with 4 AAA batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package. One of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use. Battery charger technology is not all that complicated but Kodak doesn't seem to have mastered it yet. No wonder they were practically giving these away. I'd avoid purchasing these now at any price 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 Keep a good book or a stack of old magazines handy while watching this movie. 
 Borchardt has clearly written a book intended for a female audience. Her novel left me constantly hungering for more. The female protagonist, with her duel psyches of the wolf and the human, is a power figure both figuratively and literally, as she transforms into a creature of the wild. Borchardt's exploration of the sensuality of the protagonist, as both wolf and woman, is delicious.  Yet there is description merely for description's sake. It is as if Borchardt is showing off her knowledge of the period. The heroine's antagonists are typecast as cunning, and possessing a power over the heroine far exceeding what they really have. This left me wondering whether it was their immoral power, or the heroine's own stupid, that causes her to wind up every night in chains.   A comparable text set in the Middle Ages is Lady Hawk. While Silver Wolf is a lot more romantic and sentimental, Lady Hawk possesses strong central characters that we like and laugh with, and secondary characters created for our benefit not just for the central character's development 
 I bought this card based on its capability of range and speed.  When I first bought it, it lived up to its promise.  I got great range and speed out of the card.  I could go waaaaaaaaaaay across the yard and surf the internet at blazing speed with no problems. It could go through two floors, a few walls, concrete, etc. without any issues.  Like Superman.  Life was good.  After a few months I noticed the card started to "hang".  I thought it had something to do with my p.o.s. laptop, so I would just reboot and live with it.  Another month goes by, and I notice that the card is not very stable.  It stops working after about 30 minutes, but it seems to work just great at Panera for unlimited time.  I once again chalk it up to my cheap computer.  Now, after 4 months total, the card barely works anywhere.  It gets very hot when using it, and I am lucky to get 5 minutes out of it, at Panera or anywhere else.  I tried it in another computer, same problem.  I wasted $[...], and now I am using a 3 year old slower Netgear card.  But guess what? It works.  If you are wealthy, buy 10 of these cards and just throw them out as they fail (they work GREAT for about 2 months).  Otherwise, keep shopping 
 All the characters in this book were shallow, selfish and boring. The writing was good but I could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters 
 This book is full of nonsense and open doors that get kicked in. Robert is not telling anything new. All he is telling is some common sense knowlegde your 5 year old kid can come up with. And then he repeats that knowledge a couple of times in different wordings. I regret buying this book and waisting my time. If only I had read the negative comments :-( I actually don't believe Robert and his friends. If they made themselves rich it's probably by selling books like this one and recommending eachother on the covers of those books 
 Unfortunately I have become used to typos in books.  Although this was a rare occurrence 20 years ago almost every new book has a few.  But this Lawford book has at least one error per page.  Not just spelling, grammatical, and continuity errors but also chronological, factual, and historical.  Chris goes to a jewelry store to buy a "bobble."  Do you think he meant bauble?  He mentions a cat with a "gastronomical" disorder when he clearly means gastrointestinal.  Was there any editing done at all?  Or did the publishers just rush to print with yet another Kennedy book? And there were way too many glimpses of Jackie in the bathroom.  Chris, please show some restraint and have some respect for the dead. The addiction/"recovery" story is old news but having a few Kennedy connections will always sell a book, no matter how badly written 
 My little girl loves music and has her own cd collection so I thought Id get this so she could listen to them over and over in her room ;) This cd player just frustrated her.  It doesn't work well, the buttons don't always work and even when you could get the cds to play, the volume doesnt go up over a whisper. 
 It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product 
 The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection. It is nice that it has a clip, and it fits the mp3 player snugly, but... Would be nice if it has a clear "window" to protect the screen 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 Why isn't there a "zero stars" option?  I'm sorry, but this book contains some of the most gawd awful advice I have ever seen dispensed to anyone planning a wedding.  Is it supposed to be a joke? If it is, Peter van Dijk missed the mark. Don't even file under Humor - file in the trash 
 In this novel, Ha Jin writes like a Chinese Michel Houllebecq- the language is simple and direct, and the ultimate outlook for humanity is grim. The protagonist is also a shy young male on the outer rim of the mainstream community.  Like a lot of the modern Chinese fiction, the novel is preoccupied with the psychological damage inflicted by China's Communist years, and the paranoia and self-censorship that occurs to this day. The year is 1989, and the narrator's teacher, Wang, has just had a severe stroke. The narrator, Jian, is studying for the PhD candidacy exams; he is a student of classical Chinese poetry and hopes to be granted a PhD so that he can move to Beijing to live with his fiancee Meimei, who is his teacher's daughter.  Wang's stroke has left him raving and mad. Jian is assigned by the university secretary to care for Wang while he is in hospital. During Jian's afternoons spent in the hospital room, he is audience to his teacher's ravings, which begin to reveal all sorts of disturbing truths that had managed to stay hidden until that point.  The story is set against the backdrop of the student activism leading up to the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Toward the end of the novel, Jian becomes so disillusioned by his teacher's revelations that he decides to forfeit the PhD exams, resulting in Meimei's breaking up with him. Aimless, he travels to Beijing and takes part briefly in the student demonstrations. Amid the violence, he is lucky enough to find his way back to the train station to return to his university in Shanning. Upon return he is informed that he is about to be taken away for his role in the Beijing demonstrations, and the novel ends with him on the run, having been forced by circumstances to abandon his belongings, his friends, and his identity.  The stark language with which the ending is rendered makes it all the more appalling. The matter-of-factness with which Jian takes the steps to erase himself from his previous life suggests the ordinariness of his actions in such extraordinary times. 
 Woods has produced a silly anti-history of the U.S. in the hopes of generating a little revenue by finding a spot on the lunatic right-wing fringe bookshelf. Among things you will learn: The Whites treated Indians just fine and talks of exploitation are overblown. Blacks in the South were a contented lot, and the whole system was ruined by racists like Abraham Lincoln and the later Radical Republicans. Woodrow Wilson led the U.S. into World War One despite America's resistance to doing so. No mention of Teddy Roosevelt and the " Preparedness " movement. Also no mention that it was Congress that overwhelmingly approved the war declaration. And wouldn't you know it? In post World War II, blacks were knocking down the walls of segregation in an avalanche, and there was no need for federal intrusion, M.L. King, or even a Civil Rights or Voting act.  Woods even briefly makes a foray into sports to show how segregation was crumbling, since Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color barrier in 1947. He neglects to include that it took more than 10 more years to have all the rest of the teams come aboard; and furthermore, neglects discussion of persistent racism in other sports. Amazingly, the author has a Ph.D. in History from Columbia! How? It had to be on some government sponsored program that he detests. This is straight out of the Anne Coulter/Michelle Malkin school of history: heavy on mudslinging; infantile with the wrting and history. 
 As a fan of N. Farmer after reading The House of The Scorpions, I had grasped this book with enthusiasm.  Sadly, I now question my admiration towards the author.  This book, set in early saxon era, gives overly descriptive and frank and straight forward counts of the Norse people's heinous actions, without consideration of the ages of her readers:  page 105 - "The sad eyed woman collapsed.  She hadn't been strong to begin with.  Olaf dragged her up, and with a swift movement that made Jack cry out, he cut her throat and threw her over the side."  And, that's just a tip of the iceberg.  Try a search on "cut" within this book and you will find dozens of more of these decadent actions that I truly do not believe that a young person should be reading.    	In regards the characters, I have to agree with other one-star givers, that there are no character buildings within the story.  I did not see any special ability nor courage in Jack, who was chosen to the bard's apprentice.  His sister, Lucy, is a retard - thinking the Norsemen who captured them are some king's men who came to take her back to be a princess.  Thorgil, who is one of the "shield maiden" is absurdly defiant - how she still survived the odyssey, is outrageous.  And, of course, Olaf - whose suicidal downfall was inevitable in a battle with an invincible opponent called a troll-bear.    	Only good part I see in this book is how the author tried to weave and bestows the knowledge of Norse mythology upon the readers.  The book is crammed with trolls, Asgard, Jotuns, Freya and etcetera.  It is filled with good knowledge.  Yet, the storytelling is very hectic.  Surroundings and atmospheres are left undescribed.  The novel bounds along with hiatus leaving to wonder as if this book should have been a trilogy where many sections seem detracted to fulfill the publisher's encumbrances rather than the author's artistry to shorten a potentially a greater novel to a mere kiddies' read.  	To fulfill the knowledge of Norse mythology, I would recommend "D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths"  
 This is the worst shark film i've ever seen. All of the shark attacks in the movie are done with shark fodage. And all of the shark fodage is outa all the Shark Attack films. The directer should be ashamed of himself. And one more thing,the sharks growl just like in Shark Attack 2&3. Do not buy this movie at all! 
 This book is nothing but a load of propaganda and quotes from a bible written solely by men.  This is not the type of book for an independent, freethinking woman.  This is a great book for a mindless person looking for inspiration on how to be married to a man and give him control over you.  I would suggest reading Sue Monk Kidd's, Dance of the Dissident Daughter.  It will give you far more insight on how being an empowered woman can enhance all parts of your life, including being a wife. 
 I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better. BOOK WAS OKA 
 I love the Redsox and have since I can remember, but I had trouble finishing this book.  So we get a diary from the perspective of two diehard fans.  All this does is remind me of what I was thinking during the season before/during/after certain games, but it never provided me with an interesting tidbits.  As for the perspective of a true "diehard" fan, O'Nan acts like an imbecile.  I can imagine him out at the game forcing his way past kids to get balls during batting practice.  Wow, that sure is fun to read about!!!!  And his obsession with his fishing net is scary as well.  He comes across as a whiny kid in an adult body that has fun bragging that he had an "in" during the season.  He provided nothing to the enjoyment of this book.  King was better, and because his mind seems to work differently than the average person, it was fun to see his perspective on certain events.  Some of his passages are the only reason that I gave this book two stars instead of one.  I would suggest that if you followed the season closely either through reading the Globe or Herald, or listened to Boston sports radio, you will get nothing out of this book.  If on the other hand you were caught up in the euphoria of the postseason and want to know some of the feelings Redsox fans went through during the season, you might enjoy some of the book.  Now can I direct my book royalties so that O'Nan doesn't get anything 
 I got this movie on sale a couple years ago.  It looked pretty good, but you know how most of that goes.  I really lke movies like Scream, I thought it would be like that, but nope.  This movie was a hundred percent perdictable.  I knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie.  From the first seen you can tell it's gonna suck.  *Spoiler* The first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway, when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out.  The lights flicker (Wow how original) and a person... in a really, really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax.  This is what happens throughout the entire movie.  Don't waste your time or money.  If you really want to see it i would suggest renting it... not worth more than 3.00 anytime 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
  "TRASH"  REVIEW: Mired with special guest appearances and an attempt to fit into the mold of Bon Jovi-like rockers, this is Alice at his worst. The top-ten hit single, "Poison" is the only track worth mentioning while the remaining tracks are so poorly written that you can understand why the album is called "Trash". Ok, perhaps that's a bit harsh BUT this is certainly Alice at his worst.   MUSICIANS: Far too many to list. Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, Richie Sambora, Kip Winger - to name a few.   INTERESTING FACTS:  1. The working title for "Trash" was "Low Class Reunion".   2. "Trash" was released in July of 1989 and peaked at #20. It would eventually be certified Platinum in May of 1990.  3. The single "Poison" charted at #7 and would be certified Gold. The single would mark his first US chart single in nine years!  PACKAGING:  It may be simple but "Trash" does boast a cool "iconic" photo of Alice on the cover. Lyrics are included.  APPROX. RUNNING TIME:  40 min. and 23 sec.  FINAL ANALYSIS:  "Trash," while commercially successful, is Alice's worst album that was produced under the watchful eye of pop songwriter-for-hire Desmond Child. Avoid "Trash" at all costs! *1/2 out of 5 
 I was at the airport, getting ready to fly out to Cali and I found this book in the airport gift shop- I thought what a stroke of luck I had getting a Stephen King title at such a juncture... I'm a huge  fan. Despite the fact that I started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed, I was sorely disappointed.  Much ado about nothing would be an overstatement 
 Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere 
 If you like beautifully shot, well acted films with plot lines and twists that have more holes that one of those huge wheels of swiss cheese you find at the cheese maker, this film is for you.  The most impressive slight of hand here is that viewers thought this was a great story.  I don't get it.  The story fails so miserably I can't understand how this "thing" got made.  Speaking of cheese, watch closely (as the opening narrative instructs us).  Indeed.  This film does not stand up to even the lightest level of scrutiny.  I can't tell you why without spoiling the film but here goes, you've been warned.  The entire premise of the "scientific" trick (or Tesla's REAL magic trick) at the end of the movie makes absolutely no sense at all if you are the guy doing the trick you are going to die.  If you think about all those hats out in the woods and the cat, then who ever uses the device replicates himself (the person standing inside the device) and shows up in another place not to far from the device.  If you are standing in the device you are going to die as soon as that trap door opens.  Watch it and think about it for a few minutes.  It does not make any sense without killing the original magician.    Also, there are far too many contrived scenes where the magicians are sabotaging one another after being picked to assist in a trick from among the crowd.  One will put on a disguise, go to the other's show, get picked to assist and then sabotage the trick.  How could they keep picking each other, even with the disguise, out of a crowd of volunteers in the audience?  Ridiculous.    And that brings us to the identical twin that made the original transported man trick possible...  Are we to believe that the wife and the daughter could not tell these two apart?  Have you ever dated an identical twin?  I have and I could quickly tell one from one another.  So that aspect of the story is completely dumb.  Also, are you telling me that the guy's wife would not even know he had an identical twin?  Did a high schooler write this story?  If the plot and twists are hard to follow (as one reviewer writes) it's because they don't make a darn bit of sense if you take a moment to consider what you've just seen.    Again, well acted, beautiful imagery and costumes, it's well directed, and the story COULD have been good except the screen play writers didn't really think through the scenarios.   This is a great movie picture wise, set-wise, and acting, IF you don't want to spend any time thinking about it 
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 One can't be sure that this book isn't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad, that if this weren't crappy, it wouldn't sell. Even for someone who believes in Csik's theory of flow, this book is a no-win blow-out. Instead of making clear statements backed by evidence, the book's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions. There is no reason to read this, when his original popularization, Flow, more carefully and clearly summarizes Csikszentmihalyi's interesting research. 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 Ordered my wife a subscription last christmas. Recieved 2 issues, never got the rest of them. I'll never order magazines through Amazon again. 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 Eric Hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of "scientific" Marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la Don Quixote, he is thrusting. So it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as Hobsbawm's Sancho Panza. As such I appeal to you, Eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps you were intrigued with the Greeks' romantic, albeit "unscientific," appeal to the muse for inspiration? How else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? Have courage, though! We know that your unwavering adherence to the "scientific" precepts of Marxism will excuse everything. In short, Eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching Star Trek 
 The music sounds like generic oldschool Eurobeats which is fine.  But the vocals are terrible.  He sounds like the biggest fag in the world.  They're even worse than Eiffel 65

 what a sad ending to robert pollards ever revolving band, this again is only for the diehards who want every single piece of merchandise that gbv has to offer, i jumped on the bandwagon with the release of ''propeller''way back when, but jumped off after the horrid ''isolation drills'' this dvd contains many good songs but they are just horribly played and bob's singing was disgusting, not a proper way to go out if you ask me but again, the material they were releasing near their end was bland and uninspirin

 This WOULD be a great space-saver . . . but now that Gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars, we never used it AT ALL!!  Now Gerber makes their own Feeding Center to accommodate their tubs, and I LOVE it 
 One would think that a publisher/author would invest in an editor to review the work before releasing it to the public.  This book is a pig's breakfast.  Consider:  p. 48.  Step 10:  Go to the Styles Palette and click on the water drop style icon [the one you made in a previous example] . . ..  What icon?  What previous example?  What is an example?  I thumbed through the pages and could not find one 'example.'  Boys and girls, it goes on and on.  Use your money to go see a movie and use what's left over for a trip to Hong Kong.  This book was a lot of money for rubbish.  Positive point?  The paper seems to be of good quality 
 Midnight Syndicate wants to be a lot, I guess. It wants to be dark and scary, but they're more like a graphic vampie novel, you can admire the technique but you don't really get involved. The images they produce remain a bit plastic, static, with an overdose of well-known themes.   Twenty one short tracks, too short really, are offered here, with a not-all-to-believable-and-scary voice talking: "Born of the night, they lurk in the shadows...Gargoyles of living stone, lost souls who wander mist shrouded cemetaries, and vampires who dwell deep within forbidden crypts... Creatures of the night, they arise as darkness descends..." Can lines about things that hide in the dark be even more cheesy?   Then some strings are touched like guiter wires and this sounds rather good. A heavy churchbell starts humming, dark but single layered ambient creeps in. But  it's all still too obvious, and more and more I get the feeling this is some sort of "starters kit for Gothic fans".   You want effective, deeply seeded dark ambient that really knocks the light out of you, try "Within the depths of silence & phormations" by Raison d'Etre or any of  Lustmord's solo albums "Heresy" or "The place where the black stars hang". But of course, giants in the dark ambient world like Lustmord or Raison d'Etre don't really mess with vampires and Gargoyles and bombastic electronic sounding choirpulp. And because of this, there will still be an audience for an act like Midnight Syndicate.  I just hope that M.S. will evolve more, make less tracks, and the ones they do make, should be stretched out more, giving them a chance to get more layered and filled with more depth than they are now.  Track three, the title track, offers a truely menacing piano tune, but because the composers don't seem to know what to do with it, they just keep on repeating it. And after a short three minutes the track is over. And "corny humming number four" starts. So what? 
 Psychology and Alchemy has a lot of interesting information, but it is not presented in any sort of organized fashion.  Alchemy is well known for its perplexing symbols, but in the book these symbols are only referred to in passing.  This book is not for anyone who is trying to understand how the symbolism of Alchemy relates to psychology.  The descriptions of basic elements such as the planets, the caduceus, or birds are only 1-2 sentences in length and are scattered throughout the book.  Trying to use the index won't help either, as the pages listed in the index as containing information about a topic are often incorrect as they contain no mention of the topic being looked up 
 I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense. Then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship.  But it gets kind of repetetive and boring, because they just go from one room to another.  It's like they get into one room, someone says "Here, this is the only way out."  Someone else says that maybe there's another way, but the other person says there isn't, then the water's coming, so they have to get out of that room quickly.  When they make their way into the next room, it's the same thing over and over again. When they finally get off of the ship, they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off.  Then a guy shoots a flare, helicopters come, and the movie's over. So basically, this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over.  This is one movie I know I won't be buying 
 I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me 
 As a senior college student majoring in electrical engineering, I believe that this book needs more examples. The problems at the end of each chapter rarely correlate to examples given in the text and I spend hours looking up  equations.  All in all, I am not enjoying using this text book 
 This book is a nice place for women travelers to start, but the book Travel Tips for the Sophisticated Woman by Lara Vestanen has far more depth and really useful tips 
 This vidoe is worthless with regard to factual accuracy. It is presented from the black and jewish perspectives as usual. Had they done their research, and interviewed actual klansmen, a differnet picture would have evolved. The Klan today is soley a Christian Fraternal orgainization. They do NOT terrorize or threaten, they mearly try to enlighten and to correct the inequities that media such as this tries to propogate. Yes, they do believe in segregation, but one look at the country today will prove to even the most naive and politically correct individuals how necessary segregation is. Someone needs to do an ACCURATE portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan 
 This book reads like a PhD dissertation and focuses on making reference after reference to dozens of other academic articles and books, much like a college research paper. I wonder if these 5 star reviews are from sociology professors because this is very dry reading and I can't imagine a casual reader being interested in reading this book at all 
 Rants from a socialist in denial.  Only thinly veiled lies, half-truths and distortions, packaged as documentary.  I'd only pick this up if I ran out of toilet paper.  After I rented Bowling for Columbine I returned it to the store.  They gave me my money back for the rental but if they had given me twice the rent price back I'd still feel ripped off 
 I loved Peter Robinson's "Gallow's View." "A Dedicated Man" slipped a bit. Now there's this one, which I didn't even finish. Too much procedure, not enough Banks. Not enough Jenny. The poor wife is nonexistant. That's where the story lies, not with Maggie's Farm. I will try some more Banks, but I don't know if I can keep going if they fail to engage 
 Saw this one on television.   Vincent van Gogh was misfortunate in life and certainly crazy. The artist who portrays him does his job very well.  The scenery is breathtaking.  However the nudity  in the film is vulgar. The chaeracters are hard to identify with. Some of the scenes are disgusting.   Not going to see this one again 
 This is a book for a novice, as no serious student of John Brown would consider the author has done any serious research. It's garbage. Reynolds states John Brown killed "Pro-Slavery" people. This is NOT true. The TESTIMONY of the VICTIMS, disprove that. The testimony shows John Brown murdered Northern people, while he and his men, acted like Southern people, trying to put the blame on Southern people. John Brown did not kill a single slaveowner in his murderous rampage.   Here is a quote from a Serious researched book on John Brown:  Some people believe John Brown is "A HERO". After the event below, John Brown and his gang would ride to four more houses continuing their slaughter.  "A Hero"?  [Quoting directly from Otto Scotts book, sourced below]      The night was hot and humid; the river was not far away. The Doyle family was asleep as the men approached their cabin. Two bulldogs rushed out, barking. Two of the men stopped and slashed one to death with their sabers. The other dog fled, howling, and the family awoke.       The men knocked heavily on the door and James Doyle swung out of bed. "What is it?" he called.      "What way to the Wilkinson place?" a man's voice answered.      Doyle opened the door, saying he would tell them, and was almost knocked off his feet when several men rushed in shouting, "We're the Northern Army! Surrender!"      Mahala Doyle clutched her youngest, a girl, and began to stammer. "Hush, Mother, hush," said James Doyle. His three sons moved beside him: William, twenty-two, Drury, twenty, and Hon, fourteen. The men pushed Doyle, and then the two eldest sons, out the door. Mahala Doyle began to weep, but when they reached for the fourteen-year-old she sprang out of bed and clutched him "Not him; Oh, God, not him." (3)       The old man in the light jacket, leather tie, and farmer's straw hat, his face as thin and stern as an ax, punched the boy back and the men left, slamming the door.      Mahala Doyle clutched John and listened, her eyes wide.      The men stopped their prisoners about two hundred yards from the Doyle cabin, The leader placed his revolver against Doyle's forehead and pulled the trigger (4) as coolly as a man shooting a lame horse.      That set them off. One, in a frenzy stabbed Doyle's corpse with his saber. William Doyle was stabbed in the face, slashed over the head and shot in the side. Drury broke and ran in the darkness, was pursued, and overtaken near a ravine. He put his arms up to ward off their blows, but the men, bearded, burley, and in a near frenzy, hacked at him with their sabers. His fingers and then his arms were cut off, his head was cut open, and he was stabbed in the chest. They continued to hack after he fell-and after he was dead. He had frightened them; he might have escaped.      The Wilkinson cabin was next.     Source-"The Secret Six" (John Brown and the Abolitionist Movement)-Otto Scott-copyright-1979-p.6  (3) [p.323] Cf.

 Do you love ripoff artists such as Lenny Kravitz and Norah Jones? Does true originality disturb you and drive you to seek cover in the soft womb of corporate created fluff marketed as the real deal? Then you're in for a treat with this album! Not even Rich Little could do Billie better. Texture of voice AND delivery expertly stolen without a qualm, but without any of the icky sincerity and authentic pain of the original. Enjoy 
 well, where should i start?  this book seems little more than a collection of articles written by deranged individuals.  it takes a lot to shake me but i felt dirty after reading it.  one of those article seem to glorify a killer who cracked the skull of a child with a hammer and dismissed charle manson because he had his killings done by others.  the only non article part of the book was a few pages at the end extolling the virtues of free speech.  i suspect the "author" of this book is less interested in our free speech and more interested in his freedom to publish such garbage.  there is absolutely no redeeming value in this piece of trash.  maybe it could serve as toilet paper?  i'm glad i didn't have to pay for it. i found it in a toilet when i was living in a room in a skid row hotel, infested with mice and cockroaches.  a fitting place for such a book...  vinc 
 First of all I'm upset that I didn't have an option of awarding this disaster zero stars.  But that's another story.  I must be old-fashioned because in my day most vocalists could carry a tune and if they had instruments could play them at the very least with some degree of mediocrity.  The Raincoats are a total mess from the first note and beyond. Anyone who could give this music 5 stars must be brain dead.  I suspect that it's probably fashionable to jump on the bandwagon for a band (and I use the word very loosely) with absolutely no talent.  Getting a root canal with a pneumatic drill would be more entertaining.  Anyone buying this CD should be subject to intense psychotherapy.    
 I would not buy it!  Hard to use. My machine runs slower since the install.  
 Like many of you, my 7 year old wanted this for Christmas.  What a waste of money.  I had the hardest time assembling it.  The middle funnel which is suppose to pump the chocolate kept popping up, squirting syrup everywhere.  What a big mess.  And the syrup that you have to use, which we use to make chocolate milk, does not taste good with pretzels and other salt items.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my daughter still loves to play with it.    
 I was introduced to options with this book around 1999. As I tried to read it again today 8 years later with much gained experience I realized how poorly written and edited this book is. I'm sure it's not the editor's fault as they are most likely not familiar with derivatives. Even the basics of options are botched in this poor excuse of a book. The author emphasizes that you be clear in communication with your broker when taking/offsetting positions. How ironic. The author is not even capable of basic math. 5000 x $.01 = $500? or 5000 x $.02 = $1000? Sad. The product of our American public school system? Don't bother and look elsewhere. You'd be hard pressed to find anything more poorly written than this. 
   This book is enjoyable for anyone interested in computer game design. However, enjoyable and illuminating are two different things. Beginning with the obviously misguided analysis that computer games are not an art form because the process of designing them is not all a matter of creativity, but that of skill and calculation as well (which is the way it is for any art form), the authors begin a journey of, well, describing what computer games are like.   Overall, the book seems more to describe than explain, more to report than interpret. There arises no general, well defined thesis from its 500+ page volume. At best, this book can be said to raise a lot of issues which a designer ought to have in mind when designing a game.   However, the vast majority of the issues raised are either of secondary importance or generally irrelevant. It breaks down the process of game design into topics in a way which is neither natural nor logical, and proceeds to pursue a rather sizyphusian discussion of each of these topics in turn. These are: What is Game Design?, Game Concepts, Game Settings and Worlds, Storytelling and Narrative, Character Development, Creating the User Experience, Gameplay, and The Internal Economy of games and Game Balancing.   This division makes very little sense. These topics are all so closely related, some to the point of overlapping, that attempting to develop a theorem which deals with each of them separately would result in exactly the kind of negligible book we have before us.   Actually, it would be impossible for the authors to develop any meaningful discussion of their subject, because they fail to define a) what we are trying to create and b) how do we measure our success. Nor can such a definition be induced from this overflous and superficial book. Without this definition, there is nothing that binds the book's pieces together (and, actually, had the authors bothered to provide a rigorous definition, they would have realized that no reasonable definition could be found for the garbled mess they've created), and it remains a pile of expressions in the spirit of "some people did this in some games, and some people did that in some other games". In short, the book does an admirable job in showing how NOT to perform a critical analysis of a subject, not to mention attempt to construct a wholesome theory.   While the book can be interesting at times, mainly because it makes one think on how such a book SHOULD be written, it is chuck full of assertions obviously made on the basis of misunderstandings, like the authors' curious misuse of the term Suspension of Disbelief, or their suggestion of the Hero's Journey narrative template as an object of imitation rather than a tool for analysis.   The authors' goal with this book also seems questionable. At one point, they assert that, even were it possible, we wouldn't like our player to be tormented by remorse after taking an immoral action in the game. Why? isn't moral education one of the most important and unique roles of art? If it were indeed possible, and I'm sure it is, it would've been a glorious achievement for this medium, one which would put all its previous achievements far behind.   Or are the authors only interested in computer games as a source of pure fun? If so, I suggest they invest their impressive talent and enthusiasm in cooking or adult toy design - a medium's greatness lies not in the fun it offers, and these repeatable fields are all about fun.   An interesting book for raising a large scale discussion, but one which falls short of grasping the deeper principles of its subject, and is, therefore, unimportant. 
 Maiden is my favorite metal band of all time but this is missing too many of their greats. My suggestion is to just buy all of their studio albums then make your own greatest hits CD. The best albums are Numbers of the Beast, Piece of Mind, and Powerslave. Buy those for an introduction to the band and if you like it then pick up the rest. Although some of their later CD's got poor reviews you can still find a nugget or two on each.   Below is a history of their studio albums in order, to the left I have rated them from 1-5 stars:  5 Iron Maiden (1980) Paul Di'anno on vocals (more of a punk/blues style but he still rocked.) This debut album has some beautifull melodic pieces that are timeless. Very different album than the rest. Buy it just for Phantom of the Opera (one of the best metal pieces ever.)   4.5 Killers (1981) Paul Di'anno vocals 5 The Number of the Beast (1982) Bruce Dickinson's first vocals (He is a God.) This is a must buy! 5 Piece of Mind (1983) Wow! 5 Powerslave (1984) Mind blowing material...another must buy! 4 Somewhere in Time (1986) Things start getting lighter here.  4 Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988) I like this one better than Somewhere in Time. 3.5 No Prayer for the Dying (1990)  3.5 Fear of the Dark (1992) 2.5 The X factor (1995) Dickinson out, Blaze Bayley on vocals 3 Virtual XI (1998) Blaze Bayley on vocals 4 Brave New World (2000) Dickinson returns on vocals, nice return. 4.5 Dance of Death (2003) Must buy! Paschendale and DOD are great.  5 A matter of Life and Death (2006) Most solid overall album since Powerslave. Great stuff!  I also highly recommend their live albums "Live after death" recorded in Long Beach and "Rock in Rio" recorded in front of 250,000 Brazilians. Iron Maiden is well regarded as one of the best live bands of all time and you will quickly see why if you listen to these CD's. As one critic put it "If you are in a band you don't want to follow Iron Maiden." The Rio set has some of the slower songs such as Blood Brothers but they sound great live. The Live after Death features their early and harder classics. Both of them together showcase a great balance of their career.       
 I have four 16-piece sets that I received for my wedding.  They are beautiful plates, but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use - like heating food up in the microwave, going through the dishwasher or serving hot food.    Within 3 months, several plates cracked down the middle, making them unusable.  A large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added.  I did a search on www.epinions.com and found I wasn't the only person having these problems.  EVERYONE is having these problems.  Plus, it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces.  You have to buy another set.  What a racket.  The clincher is that they are located in Indonesia, so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent.  I've gotten nothing but the international run-around 
 This book has lots of information about the hospital stay and I would recommend only to parents whose baby has just been born. My baby has been home for several months, and because the title said "The First Five Years" I was very disappointed. There was very little of relevance to me now or for the future 
 quindlen's advice here is certainly pretty sensible stuff, though i think any reasonably intelligent person could have come up with something just as good.  my real beef is with the price of the book in comparison to what you get.  the book is only 64 pages long and half of those pages are pictures with no text anywhere on the page.  so, being charged $12.95 for a 32 page book, and a pretty small one at that, strikes me as beyond ludicrous, even if the content is pretty good.  i'm just glad i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
 DVD's which play perfectly well on other cheap players, freeze/skip or don't play when I try to play them on the XBOX. Don't waste your money on this, buy a stand-alone DVD player instead so you won't have the frustration that I've had 
 This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work 
 I'm writing this reveiw on the company, Discount Ramps, rather than the ramps themselves. They charged my credit card immediately upon ordering, then 6 weeks later when I inquired about where these ramps were, they told me the manufacturer hadn't received the metal to build them yet, and the build time is 4-6 weeks. Just be careful, people 
 I bought this slicer, to cut my German bread, that I bake myself. The slicer worked good at first and I was pleased, but after 5 1/2 months, I started to have problems with it. The machine started to make noises and the blade would stop spinning. Come to find out, that the gears ( located underneath the blade ) are made out of plastic and the wore out. So if you need this slicer for cutting bread like I do, it's no good. Now I'm on the search for a slicer that has gears out of metal, but it seems like there is none. I've contacted Deni and Waring and their gears are made out of plastic as well. So if anyone out there has a slicer that has metal gears or has a slicer that has lasted more than 1 year in constant use, please let me know. I need a good one for a decent price. 
 People People People Please! If you have ever seen Rick James live you would know this is the real Rick James. The one that showed up for the show but forgot to bring the show with him. The band was cooking soul food  while Rick was in the backstage eating. When he was on stage he was rushing through it all so he could get backstage to Mary Jane. I love Rick James but let's face it, this was one that should have got away. I was very upset buying this junk, it's not how I want to remmember Rick James. If he had spent more time on the set and actually sing his songs than jumping around and messing with the crowd, who you could feel they wanted Rick to cut to the chase and stop getting them up for a flash of James. ONE STAR! 
 First let me say that I'm a big MATRIX fan. I also have a passion for philosophy. I had high hopes for this book but was soon dissapointed. With each new essay I felt I was starting over. The cave analogy became tiresome and I often found the different essayist going over the same topics. The other writters seem to use the movie to go off on ideas that have little to do with the movie. If you're just starting out in philosophy this might make an o.k. introduction otherwise I would keep looking 
 This book, although it covers a broad range of topics, does not adequately cover any of them.  I teach sewing and bough this book thinking it might be good to use as a text, and was very disappointed.  The pictures are hard to see, the directions vague.  If I did not know what they meant already, I never would have been able to figure it out from this text.  I do not recommend this book to any seamstress at any level 
 Entertaining and fast read marred by naive Noam Chomsky economics.  Assuming you can get over the author's silly dedication to "those, globally, whose lives have been wrecked or snuffed out by the Great Neoliberal Dream and Slash-and-Burn Globalization", the book makes for a quick "slash and burn" read.  'Mad Max meets Michael Moore' is an appropriate  description for this book.  There is much that is implausible about this book: coporate car death duels between bankers to win financial contracts, a utopian socialist Scandinavia in the latter half of the 21st century (that model is collapsing as we speak), segregation of 90%+ of the population in corporate controlled "zones", a fellow with the initials "DC" who runs a dominant oil company that yes, has the same acronym as Halliburton.  You get the drift.     Whenever the author described the weather I was expecting to read about record temperatures being set due to capitalism induced global warming. Fortunately, the author didn't go this far.  In summary, it's an entertaining cyber punk dive into the anti-globalist mind, a jaunt through an "inevitable" nightmarish corporatist world where humanity's best hope lies in socialist Sweden and where humanity's engine of corporate death resides in the US and UK.  Ho hum.  
 This third volume of the Cream series disappointed me. I say this mainly because this book gets bogged down in either conceptual ideas that are less than grandiose or curatorial/theoretical high-mindedness that trumpets the intelligence and sensitivity of those compiling the list. Instead of looking at emerging artists either from the markets point of view or as those new artists inspiring other artists, this book becomes about as flat and appealing as rusty water.  Its one saving grace is that it is bringing dozens of artist's attention for the first time in a major publication. And even if these artists' work for the most part is less than overwhelming, it is interesting to explore their work. Maybe not enough time passed between the first, second, and third Creams to allow for the quality found in the first two. But I suspect it was primarily those that did the compiling this time around that are to blame for the damaging of an otherwise fine series.   Try Vitamin P or the earlier Creams if you are interested in a contemporary art survey.  
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps. 
 This S80 used to be the only WIDE ANGLE compact point and shoot digital camera on the market. It has now been discontinued I'm told. But, we're in luck! There are THREE other digital point and shoot cameras with a real 28mm WIDE ANGLE lens! These are: 1) The Panasonic DMC-FX01 for $250, and the 2) Canon Powershot SD800 IS for $400. and, 3) The Kodak EasyShare V570 for about $350.   So, you ask, "who needs a 28mm lens?" You do! Most people concern themselves with how LONG is their telephoto lens. But, most people who "know" know that it is the WIDE ANGLE lens that is most important---most of the "best shots" are made with a WIDE ANGLE lens. For example, you're in Europe and you are trying to "get a shot" of that Cathedral of Notre Dame over there. You NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are in the California Poppy Fields and you want to get the expanse of the golden-yellow poppy flowers with the huge blue sky filled with white clouds above---you need a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are sitting at thanksgiving dinner and you want to take a photo from the foot of the table with everyone sitting on the left and right---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are in the garden of the California Mission and you want to take a photo of the ENTIRE garden surrounded by the mission walls---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. It's Christmas day and you want a photo of the ENTIRE GROUP of visitors in front of the Christmas Tree---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. This is where the 28mm lens on THIS camera comes in! So, you NEED THIS CAMERA! Otherwise you'll be cutting off heads and leaving Aunt Sylvia out of the "Christmas Group Photo" this year---and she'll disinherit you and as a result of not having a wide angle lens you'll live a life of poverty and misery everafter! :o) If you agree or disagree or know of ANY other digital point and shoot camera that has a WIDE ANGLE lens please write, Email:boland7214@aol.   Here's one more wide angle candidate: Kodak EasyShare V705 7.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Ultra-Wide-Angle Dual-Lens Optical Zoom     
 I am a Buffet fan but I hated this CD.  The Acoustic guitar stuff is distorted. The rest has jimmy at his worst.  I recommend choosing a different Buffet C 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 This novel is a travesty and should never have been published.  I am so sorry that any of my money went to a company, Coronet, that would render such a great author's work into a chopped up mess.  Read Whirlwind, it is great and essentially you will get two books for one if you believe that Escape is one unto itself ( I obviously don't).  I was expecting further elaboration upon the story line of Azadeh and Erikki but it is just each section that pertains to them chopped out of Whirlwind and put into a separate novel, butchers!  
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 ,,, instead of dispassionate, reasoned argument. Faludi interprets everything, *everything*, as proof of her argument that a "war" has been declared against women. There are no shades of grey, and no counterarguments in Faludi's book. This makes me wonder just how carefully she did her research; assumning she dug deeply enough, did she just disregard anything that didn't tend to support her point of view? I have worked hard to get a JD and an MBA, and if that education has given me only one great lesson, it's that you cannot ignore real contrary evidence (and it's always out there); you might not like it, but you must address it.  I'm a woman in my 50s, and I believe that, with friends like Faludi, women don't need enemies. If ever a man described women as inferior to men in terms of capacity for reasoned argument, all he'd need to do to prove his point is refer to Faludi's screed.   Faludi's book is geared to the sheep among women and the ignorant among young girls. Academics are bound to eat it up, unfortunately; particularly those poor disenfranchised tenured female professors.   
 Need a quick lesson in intolerance for your child? Try this despicable & poorly written book. Totally inappropriate for this age group. Lacks any nuance, and deals only in hackneyed and offensive stereotypes. It is depressing that parents feel the need to indoctrinate their children in this way, at this age. I am an educator, and I am appalled 
 *warning* spoilers What an awful adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy's General Tilney. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen. 
 This was, by far, the most disappointing novel I have read by Bharti Kirchner.  It was contrived, stereotypical and sappy.  Though, the plot idea was intriguing--a seven year old Indian girl is married off to her best friend, is then separated from her groom, her mother is brutally beaten and she ends up adopted by a white, America couple--it didn't hold together.    One of the biggest flaws in the book was the stereotypical depiction of the characters.  The worst is of Carlos, the main character, Meena's, good friend.  Though he is from Mexico, he teaches her samba (from Brazil), Kirchner misspells his hometown of Oaxaca (she spells it Oxaca).  He is macho and womanizing, and seemingly mindless.  Also, Bharti's writing style seems half-baked and almost condescending to her readers.  Kirchner ties up the complications a little too readily and unbelievably.   If you would like to read a far superior novel by Kirchner, my reccomendation is that you read "Sharmila's Book," which is also about a young Indian woman's bicultural sense of self.  Far more interesting, compelling and well written 
 On his internet website (in the column titled "Wussyism At Harvard") Fred says black people end up in prison "Largely because of an almost infinitely documented fifteen-point deficit in intelligence, however measured, between blacks and whites." But Fred conveniently neglects to mention what sources he's referring to. Maybe the sources in his dreams.  Look at the other reviewer talking about his Anglo brothers in the UK, Australia, and where ever else white people live. If that doesn't give you an indication of the type of people this book will attract, then I don't know what will. Disgruntled white males need only apply 
 I bought this item "blind," meaning I couldn't inspect it to see if it was what I was expecting.   First, a little background:  DeVito and Strickland put out a large hardcover illustrated book called KONG, KING OF SKULL ISLAND. It was a prequel and sequel to the original KING KONG novel. Naturally, I wanted to have the original novel so the two could be a "set," so my expectations of this book were as follows:  A hardcover book that was the same size as KONG, KING OF SKULL ISLAND, and lushly illustrated with new art by DeVito. I also expected it to have the original 1932 text by Delos W. Lovelace.   Those were my expectations, now here's what it actually is:   The book is only available in paperback and is about 3/4 of the size of KING OF SKULL ISLAND. The illustrations are sparse, most of which are partial-page black and white pencil sketches. That's not the worst part. The illustrations in this book are LEFTOVERS not used in KONG, KING OF SKULL ISLAND. The nicely done cover of Kong on the Empire State Building is not used in the interior at all, and key scenes begging for a picture in an "illustrated edition" don't have one.   Oh, and the original Lovelace text? Not here. Oh, some of it is here, but Strickland had to rewrite the story so this could be a joint follow-up to KKOSI, but it looks and feels like a rush job.   So don't buy this book thinking it is either the original 1932 novelization, or a worthy companion to KONG, KING OF SKULL ISLAND, because it is neither. 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 It isn't worth the box it's mailed in, let alone $12.  The poles and pieces of balsa wood that supposedly hold the thing together break apart while assembling it.  (The poles are all the right length by the way, you just have to assemble it correctly - not an easy feat.  It's very easy to put it together backwards.  And then taking it apart and putting it back together the right way is nigh impossible 
 The first Farseer book impressed me with its great writing and interesting characters. The second book, though not as great, was still a solid sequel. This third Farseer book is a mess (see Kaymin's comments). The 757 page book (paperback version) should have been edited to fewer than 500 pages. A few of the ill-considered, disjointed plot lines also should have encountered the delete key.   What could not be repaired are some of the idiotic key elements such as the fact that no one remembered that the ancient race who helped the citizens of Buck were actually dragons that exist as stone statues until imbued with the memories, souls, and lives of multiple humans. What the heck? And somehow, the protagonist, FitzChivalry, continues to make the same stupid mistakes he did as a teenager and still manages to survive. Of the main characters, only his wit-bonded wolf made reliably sensible decisions.  Given the flaws described above, I am astonished by the many five star reviews of this book. I believe that fans of the first two books were overly generous to this one 
 I bought 4 of these light sets after seeing them in Real Simple magazine. I thought they looked and seemed to be a perfect option for my kitchen......WRONG! After only 15 minutes, my brand new batteries (4 AA) seemed to fade, and within an hour.....DEAD.  I thought this is a mistake, and bought new batteries again, only to be upset when the same thing happened!  I called the manufacture about getting the adapter 4.8V it requires.....only to be told they do not sell to the public and I would have to track it down at Radio Shack, etc. Well, I have had no luck on that yet.....lots of 4.5V, but no 4.8V. I wish I could send these back. They were a complete waste, and if I ever find the proper adapters, I will certainly use them. But that defeats the purpose of me choosing wireless lighting, doesn't it 
 Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books.  We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption 
 Over the top attempts at wit seldom work, as this volume proves. I like dry humor, sarcasm and off the wall references, but this is just dumb 
 Sorry Rod, but I've heard this stuff, and I have to say this is pure garbage. It hurts me to say this too. What happen to you. Stick with the rock and roll you know like Maggie May, Stay With Me, Hot Legs, remember these, or are you getting senile. I loved you in The Jeff Beck Group, Faces, or even early you or 80's you, but swinger Rod, I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!! 
 This book is a disappointing finish to the Gemini trilogy.  The characters were inconsistent with the first two books of the series in such a way that this book seemed not a finish at all but rather a separate story all together.  
 I thourougly enjoyed the movie, but these cuts remind you singularly forgettable the music sound track is (with the exception of one or two tunes such as "So Long and Thanks for All the Fish."   Save your money for the DVD, or better yet, look at the BBC video of the original TV production 
 I find this book good as a quick reference but not for best in design for logos. It has mix of very great to low ends. I would hope that they would do more screening of the quality of the logos 
 At First When I Got It, It Seemed Fun.  Then As The Minutes Go By It Got Boring Quick.  The Missions Suck, The Bosses Are Too Hard.  I Just Sold My Game,  If You Buy This Game You'll Be Doing The Sam 
 I was not thrilled with this work.  Here's why:  The movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow.  It is beautifully filmed with great costumes, colors, imagery but the acting is so bland, almost weak!  Christ, I wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate! The sex scenes were boring.  Maybe i should make films!  This is frustrating!! It had it's moments so, 2 stars.  Wish someone would make a movie about 'Narcissus and Goldmund' or 'Cloister and the Hearth'.  Now That would be Passionate! (unless Amblin or Touchstone did it). 
 I have nothing more to say than I've already said in my headline. Lou Dobbs' book was a big disappointment for me.  
 I heard Dr. fishman on public radio and got excited that maybe there was hope for my chronic pain. After finishing the book I realized this guy is only out to sell a book and promote his practice. The book was a waste of  time and money and gave me more reason to be depressed.  He offers little  information that will give any hope of curing pain.  In the end you walk  away from reading it with the feeling that it is hopeless.  So don't even  bother wasting the thousands of dollars it takes to get tested and prodded  because in the end you will never be cured. Save your money and buy some  other book amazon has in its vast arsenal that will get your mind off of  your pai 
 I have been a huge fan of the original "Mad Scientist's Club" since I was a kid.  I continued to re-read it as I grew up and read it to my children.  Needless to say, when I found out that another Mad Scientist's book was coming out, I could hardly wait to get my hands on it.  Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.  None - and I mean none - of the stories reached the level of any in the original.  As an example, The Flying Sorcerer was nothing more than The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake "gone airborne" or The Unidentified Flying Man of Mammoth Falls "light".  My advise is to stick with the original, save your money and skip this one 
 It worked great for a few days, then as I got to the bottom of the batch of wipes, they were totally dry.  Also, the whole thing flooded my changing table, not sure why, but I am returning this unit 
 I am a long time beer brewer, who suddenly decided to switch to cider. This book starts with planting trees. I didnt want to wait that long. I wanted recipes! The section on yeast was a real disapointment, it listed one yeast not to use. Elsewhere I have read of the debate over English Ale yeasts or Champagne yeasts. This was the info I wanted. If you have NEVER brewed this is your book. If you have ever brewed and want to make a batch skip this one, get Paul Correnty's "Art of Cidermaking". Yes its out of print and runs nearly $50.00, but its worth it 
 Let me qualify something.  I have a two year old.  This book is not good for a two year old.  Pictures: Poorly done, with some artistic watercolors that are really to dark.  Not a bright happy and pleasing in the illustration department.  The pictures are really elementary in skill level.  Story:  This book is really just a huge social message about the loss of habitat for certain animals.  I dont think that little kids really can conceptialize this let alone care.  The message also offers no solution to the problem.  Leaves you hanging at the end as you wonder if you missed something.  Text: Not a rhyming book.  Actually, just did not have good flow.  I hate to be the odd man out here, but for MY purposes - not a book that I would recommend you buy 
 I bought this DVD for my third-grade twins who are having difficulty memorizing math facts, and don't quite understand the relation between these math facts and the real world.  I thought this DVD would be perfect, explaining basic math facts with humor and real life examples.  But their explanations are way over the heads of this age group.  In explaining the concept of "carrying over" while adding, for instance, here is what is said and written out on the screen:  "Carrying over means you take the digit in the tensplace of the digit place sum, and carry over that digit to the next digit place to the left in your addition problem.  You do this whenever the sum amount in the digit place is greater than nine."  Yeah, *I* get it, but it is not the simplest way to present it to an elementary grade child.  I'm not certain what grade level this series is for -- perhaps middle school and above? -- but definitely not for those just starting out 
 I wasn't too impressed about this book as many other reviewers were. The only positive thing I can say about this book is for its style. Obviously, Leo Tolstoy is well-known for his novel epics, WAR AND PEACE, and ANNA KARENINA, and also for his short stories (some which I've read and enjoyed). But from reading this book I didn't really see that brilliant storyteller. The book is more like a biography about a fictional character and his death than an actual story. Of course we as the reader get the universal ideas of death (such as "better him than me" attitude, "Why do i deserve to die this way God?" etc.), and as someone who has recently overcome the lost of a family member, I can relate. But to me I found this book boring and pointless to read (thank goodness it was a NOVELLA!). I don't really see how other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I mean it was a well-written book and all, but nothing worth bragging about, and it's definitely NOT Tolstoy's best work. 
 This vacuum cleaner is great in theory.  In practice, it appears to have been designed by someone who has never actually had to use a vacuum cleaner under realistic conditions.  My kids hate using it because it is so bulky and inflexible, even though it is substantially lighter than our previous cleaner; often you have to vacuum over small ordinary bits of thread and lint many many times before the cleaner will grab them...I guess it's some consolation to know that in the meantime, it is sucking up invisible microparticles.  Forget about vacuuming under furniture ever again; the hose is held in a long inflexible cumbersome wand that prevents you from working in small spaces; the suction causes the hose to collapse upon itself.  The bagless suction is great, but it belongs in machines designed by people who have already come to grips with all the other things a decent vacuum cleaner needs to do.  We would never buy one again, never recommend one, and have had frequent cause to regret this expensive purchase 
 I hate to be the 'dog in the manger' on this one, but I found this book very irritating.  Not so much in that it's a particularly badly written book (it's not), but its incredible popularity is more an indictment of it's fans rather than it's creator.  Mitch Ablom books, in general, and "For One More Day" in particular, are popular for the same reasons McDonalds, Olive Garden, Celine Dion, and Tom Cruise are popular.  They provide a mass audience (baby boomers in particular), with a well-packaged, predictable, easily digestable, intellectually nonthreatening, and utterly mediocre product.  "For One More Day" is tailored to the worst in the whiny, self-absorbed baby boomer generation.  As the boomers age, they greet the almost universal midlife themes of dissapointment and regret as if they were the very first people to ever experience those emotions, and make a huge deal of broadcasting and analyzing their feelings to death.  Who doesn't reach middle age and not feel some regret that they didn't write the Great American Novel, marry the Homecoming Queen/King, or start a fabulously successful dot-com?  I guess with the baby boomers it's a particularly bitter pill because they were brought up from the get-go to believe they were oh-so-SPECIAL.  Mitch Ablom has tapped this rich vein of boomer angst to great success.  His protagonist, 'Chick' Benetto, is a washed-up ball player with a broken marriage and a drinking problem.  In a fit of self-pity, he tries to kill himself and botches that one too.  He meets his dead mom, acknowleges he has been a real poop, and finds redemption.  Cue the string section and loosen the tear ducts.  Oh gag me!!!!  Even some of his 'novel' plot devices are nothing new.  Anyone who has read "An Incident at Owl Creek Bridge" by Ambrose Bierce will be spitting nails at Ablom's shameless cribbing of the books main twist.  The book itself is a childishly easy read.  Ablom is no great artist with the English Language, and no one with greater than a third-grade reading ablily will be taxed by this one.  Faulkner, Eco, and Melville can rest easy.    The baby boom generation has never been known for it's intellectual horsepower, and this book is tailor-made for the Oprah Nation.  A lightweight tome for a lightweight, self-indulgent society 
 I'd call myself a pretty big Bodycount fan, and most people I know think that BC are a joke and ask me how I can like them.  The first three discs were excellent.  I like "Drive By", "Bowels of the Devil" "Dead Man Walking" as my favorite songs from their first 3 albums which were excellent. This disc, man I remember buying BC Violent Demise the day it came out the same with Born Dead when it came out, and I don't feel anything at all for this disc.  I'll probably never listen to this disc again except out of obligation to the fact that I bought it, so that it would be alongside my other BC cds.  The mixing is painfully bad, so much so that it interferes with all enjoyment of the disc.  There is no guitar prescence whatsoever.  The drum sound sounds almost like it was played on an electronic kit than a beefy live sound.  Ice-T's vocals are way, way, WAY too loud in the mix.  Which is unfortunate because it doesn't complement the songs, it just makes you real, real, sick of Ice after a few minutes.  He's cool when he's talking about politics and terror and other street topics, but when there are more and more songs per BC album where Ice T is crooning/singing literally off key about trying to get girls, it makes you real embarassed for him that the song got that bad.  Back to the production, whoever was at the mixing board on this disc was high.  Everything about this release stinks "Bad bootleg" including the horrible cover art, but sad but true, we waited 8-9 years for a new album that was a total disappointment.  
 Although this book has a noble purpose, it gets lost in meaningless fluff and 50 cent words.  Why do authors feel the need to write books for people with degress in Literature instead of the general audience???    I guess that's why there is "Best-Selling Authors" not "Best-Writing Authors"  It was hard to read and had so much rhetoric to classical literature.  If you like reading Thesis papers, this is for you.     
 Save your money!  I have sat through some terrible movies, but this one takes the cake.  There is no plot.  It is a below-low budget movie that looks as if it was recorded on a cell phone.  The character on the movie basically repeats the exact same thing with three or four different victims, and the whole time we are subjected to slaughterhouse footage.  There is no way to really even know what is being done in the scene at hand.  Even the Henry movie, and Dahmer look like 5 star movies compared to this one.  
 If mind-bending thrillers like Basic Instinct prove anything, the theme of an expert becoming obsessed with his cryptic subject presents a great deal of potential. This film attempts a similar tapestry. Our protagonist (Ewan McGregor) finds himself progressively involved in eavesdropping a disturbing femme fatale across the street (Ashley Judd) who's in the blackwidow-spider type habit of zapping all males she beds. Problem is, nothing much happens of this premise. We never find ourselves feeling for the agent or his liege. No romantic overtures with dangerous undertones. No edge of the seat interactions ala Sharon Stone films of the early 90s. Instead, there's a queer apparition of the agent's daughter that punctuates every second scene and adds to the pile of threads that end up nowhere. Such constant failure to take advantage of its almost-intriguing buildups gets the film my generous 1-star rating, anyone but McGregor's biographer needn't bother 
 Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless 
 I have been a fan of Orson Scott Card for years. I loved the Bean & Ender Series and would picked up a book just because his name was attached without the usual research, recommendations from friends, reading reviews, etc. After reading Empire, those days are over. This book was a disappointment and I felt I was reading a piece of propaganda for the right wing rather than a meaningful piece of fiction.  Empire is a quick read, fine for a rainy day if nothing else is available. The characters are shallow and the plot predictable. The book is more of a soapbox than anything else. I guess that's his right to use his publishing clout anyway he wants, he has earned it. It is also mine to look elsewhere for my reading selections 
 After book 4 the series begins to meander around.  Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks.  The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the "bad witches") seen from different characters perspectives.  This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing.  The author must being paid by the word count and not the content.  The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again.  I no longer have the patience to actually read each page.  I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action.  The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell.  His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on.....  This series had a good basic story.  Unfortunately you have to wade through crap to try and find it.  I'm beginning to wonder if the series will ever end 
 The title of this book is a bit mis-leading. Many of the recipes call for many, many ingredients and the prep time is off. For example, one recipe says 20 min. prep time. But after you read it, it says to put something in the fridge for several hours. Making a lifestyle change like the Zone is hard enough without adding the frustration of buying sooo many ingredients and putting together complicated recipes. Plus, chicken and Salmon are about the only ingredients as meats. Where's pork or turkey 
 The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes... 1. Frisby 2. Mirror 3. Toilet paper 4. Shooting target 5. Tras 
 This book of more than a thousand pages has every topic that could possibly be on the ACT. The topics are explained in a clear, concise manner. But there are so many topics that their explanations are almost too concise: Two or three sentences of explanations are given and a couple of examples. The format of the examples are in a No and Yes format for the English section. The drills in the English section and Science have good explanations with them. But in the Math section, in which work might be needed, there are no explanations, only answers. The Reading section has no explanation either. The diagnostic test and four other tests gives you great explanations for each topic, though.  Don't get me wrong, some topics are explained well because of the many sub-categories. But other topics are really sketchy on the details. Also, in the English section, the book expects you to memorize all the "by-the-book" terms, like superlative and present perfect. I had never even heard of those terms until I had taken a Spanish class. Moreover, other books might help you memorize things by acronyms but this book if just full of dry information.  If you have to take the ACT in a couple months or weeks, this is a very bad book for you. With all this info, you would need a year to get through it all. Moreover, there is so much stuff that you really don't need for the ACT. This book gives you years worth of information. You can really tell from the science topics of astrology, meteorology, physics, etc.   At least now I understand the elusive diffence between who and whom. 
 Writing is about more than researching. This is the worst written, worst edited book I've ever read. Scribblings from Professor Hirshson's notes - I had to stop after 76 pages 
 The author seemed to be on a soap box about the public education system and how we all need to boycot.  But I was able to stop cracking my knuckles using one of the methods 
 I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.  The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them.  Everything was very 2 dimensional for me.  I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun.  I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy.  But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many 
 This was my first -- and last -- Cat Who book.  I bought it because I needed something to read at the beach, but found it so inane that I went for another swim instead.  Having spent money on the book, I felt obligated to eventually finish it.  I kept wondering when I would discover the plot, but alas, the book ended without one.  I had hoped to read a mystery story, but the only mystery -- the body found on Qwilleran's property -- was never developed.  Another reviewer called this book a pastiche -- a quite appropriate word.   Want to write a book like this?  Here's how...  Take a small town newspaper, cut out stories at random, then stick them together.  Throw in a rather silly single male journalist who spends his days wandering in and out of other people's lives, writing corny sayings and then attributing them to his cat (I thought Koko was supposed to be smart!), eating in restaurants, and traveling between his various properties 
 I have to start by saying that I love christmas music, especially all the "Golden Oldies" like Bing Crosby, Ray Coniff, Nat King Cole and Andy Williams. I bought this CD to add to my collection because I love the Rudolph the Reindeer movie and thought this CD would be cute. It is NOT cute, it is actually completely awful! He sounds raspy, the songs are completely off tune, and the whole CD is depressing. I have never been so disapointed in a Christmas CD, I gave it away to a charity store. It is not even worth $7.99. DON'T BUY THIS!!! 
 Having read Ms. Martin's other titles in this series with varying degrees of genuine enjoyment, I had high hopes for Chasing Stanley.  To put it bluntly, Stanley (the Newfoundland) was the most engaging character in this book.  Delilah had possibilities, mostly unfulfilled, as too much time was spent emphasizing how insecure and pitiful she is.  Her good character traits, such as empathy, kindheartedness, etc. were illustrated at the beginning and then shoved aside in favor of trying to illustrate the lacklustre romance.  And the hero...ugh!  Juvenile, thoughtless, and cruel with a budding alcohol problem are not exactly qualities I look for in a romantic hero.  Overall a very disappointing read.  Check it out from your library if you feel you must, but don't waste your money 
 should both teach and delight.  The Monk's delights are many, but it teaches not.  therefore, two stars 
 I'm a great fan of Bujold, and in particular of the Vorkosigan series. But this one is a lemon. Clearly, and very unusually for her, Bujold had nothing to say and no idea what to write about. The only reason to read this book is if you've read every other Vorkosigan book (and the superb Curse of Chalion), in which case you probably loved them so much you wouldn't trust this review anyway. 
 Don't waste your time with this, folks. This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film "Graffiti Bridge."   But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it 
 I thought the concept for this dvd was great- choose a different workout every day, really work on toning the parts of the body I wanted when I wanted.  The other reviews seemed very promising.  So I was thrilled when I got the dvd and saw the different menus and the variety of workouts available.  The reality was a little different.  Yes, there's a great deal of variety to choose from, but the instructor has all the rhythm and charisma of a narcoleptic chartered accountant.  The routines have no rhythm- the spacing between reps was completely irregular which made it very difficult to follow the excersizes without keeping my eyes glued to the TV screen.  The workouts are performed by the instructor while a recorded-after-the-fact voice-over kind of rambles through the instruction.  It felt very awkward to try and do- there's no flow to it.  I'm sure that the instructor knows her stuff and she seems to be really good at pilates, but the lack of clear rhythm and direction makes this dvd impossible for me to follow or enjoy.  
 This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par 
 I completely agree with the prior reviewer -- this book was way too silly to be taken seriously.  I've read some of Stuart Woods' earlier work, which was VERY well written and believable.  This book was decently written (I finished it) but had so many ridiculous plot developments that I can't recommend it.  My advice is to skip this book unless you're looking for pure escapism. 
 This is the off-beat story of Esker, a 31 year old woman who, since her college years, has been haunted by a past relationship disappointment.  The question of the story: will she allow a man to love her again?  Interesting premise, but there are many problems with the way it was handled: the previous lover was so unloving it's difficult to empathize with the extreme loss Esker's felt in his absence;  Esker offers so little in the way of emotional connection to the new man in her life, his continued affection for her doesn't make sense; the book never delivers anything in the way of character growth or change.  Nothing happens here.  She's unhappy in the beginning.  She stays that way.  A real disappointment.  I got the sense the author was more interested in the way she used language than in what she was actually saying 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 The stocking were very lovely.  The pic shows an elastic on the thigh area which is false.  I bought these for my wedding and did not even open the package until the day of.  I was very upset to learn that I needed the elastic straps to hold the stockings up 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 I'm not a huge fan of this phone.  I got it because I needed a new phone, it was only 40 bucks and, it's pink.     1.  The battery life on this phone is TERRIBLE.  T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.  Yesterday, after charging the phone the ENTIRE night, took it off the charger about 8am for work.  I made a 5 minute phone call, a 6 minute phone call, entered a number into my contacts, entered an event into my calendar, received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping "low battery"!!!!!  2. The ringtones are SOOOOOOO crappy.  Remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago?  That's what is here.  3. The date and time don't continuously display on the outside screen.  I don't have a clock in my office (I have a very small office and work for a non-profit) and I don't wear a watch, I'm constantly opening my phone to see the time, it's ridiculous.  4.  The battery life is TERRIBLE.   The good thing about this phone so far:  Great reception.  I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am able to speak to them before the battery goes dead.     If you want a cute-sy phone and you speak for less than 10 minutes a day, this is a great phone.  Otherwise get something else 
 I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).  At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.  Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist 
 This book has two key faults:  the author's unobjective/uncritical assessment of her subject and an asleep-at-the-wheel editor.  Carmel Snow seems to have been a fascinating and complex character, but the author's apparent idol/family-worship prevented her from viewing Mrs. Snow critically.  That ultimately makes the Mrs. Snow presented in this book a one-dimensional character - "Aunt Carmel who worked like a man, didn't have much time for her family, etc."  It would have been interesting to know, for example, why Bazaar's circulation numbers often didn't equal Vogue's, for all of the paeans to Mrs. Snow's editorial genius.  What were the real, business reasons for the housecleaning at Bazaar after Mr. Hearst died?  Mrs. Snow's alcoholism was almost entirely avoided until the very end, when it was presented as "Mrs. Snow liked to have several cocktails at lunch" and then noted only as the cause of a highly embarrassing social moment.  Alcoholism doesn't happen overnight, as it seems to in this book, and it would have been interested to know what effect it had on her work.  The book also suffers from the want of a good editor who could have eliminated the author's juvenile asides to the reader, e.g. "how to put it", "Pace, Nigella Lawson" etc.  
 I went through at least half the pack on wasted jammed paper. I truly have never had a problem with paper going through my printer, but this - frankly - sucked. The stomper software is pretty lousy for bringing in artwork created outside the program, but I got that down after two mis-registered prints. SO I THOUGHT I was finally in the clear- until this cheap backing and paper started ripping in the print feed. How hard does Avery have to work to make a decent product. Jut to be clear- the original stomper paper that came in the pack worked fine through the same printer. So I can only assume the problem is this product. Maybe they "reformulated" the product if they manufactured the original. Probably saves them a buck a pack. Truly a disappointment  - and waste of time and ink 
 I love independent films but this one was a bomb. Starring Courtney Cox as Sophie, a Los Angeles art school photography teacher. One night her and her boyfriend stop at a convenience store to pick something up- a robber comes in and shoots him. She goes in and finds him and from there we dont know what happened, the story gets fast forwarded to after the murder and Sophie trying to deal with the grief and what actually took place that night. Every couple days shes having visions of what might have took place. Sophie is as confused as the viewer is whos watching this film, trying to piece together disorienting memories of the murder. As November is finally starting to make some sense, the movie starts over. Tons of repeats of scenes & the repetition does nothing for the film. At the end youre left wondering what the hell you just saw, what actually happened & what the real truth is in this story. This film is reminiscent of Memento yet nowhere near as interesting. A very serious movie starring a former sitcom star. Picture David Lynch meets Memento, thats what this film is. Im not a huge fan of Lynch and i felt memento was an average movie. So if you like the above mentioned maybe you should give it a shot but I wouldnt recommend this film. Some words id use to describe this film are surreal, cold, claustrophobic, confusing, I guess you could call it a mystery. I wouldnt recommend this. 
 I first  read J. Gilbert many years ago: many people, it seems, jump on the bandwagon whey they find a poet who doesn't publish often or publish a lot of poems. Mr. Gilbert has admirable feelings, but he is unable to translate them into readable, cogent, successful poems. He is not better nor worse than many poets who are acclaimed (wrongfully, for the most part) and regularly published: e.g. Jorie Graham; Louise Gluck; May Oliver; Maxine Kumin; Charles Simic, Gary Snyder etc. ad infinitum, ad nauseam.   The major problem respecting poetry in America today is that we have too many writers and too few readers (I know, some good poets can't get published--true, but far fewer poets than most people realize). Mr. Gilber subtracts time from the reading of other poets, including especially the classics: Virgil, Dante, Donne, Herbert, Pope, Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth, Dickinson, Yeats, Pound and Eliot, to name well-known poets. Among more recent poets, those readers who effuse over Gilbert and many other current poets, should be reading Elizabeth Bishop; Edgar Bowers; Geoffrey Hill (often difficult, but absolutely the best poet of our time and certain to be studied in years to come); Basil Bunting; Charles Tomlinson (a must!!!); John Berryman (Dream Songs); J.V. Cunningham.    That said I have read volumes and volumes of poetry published in the last 25 years. Good poets are there for the reading: Betty Adcock; Dick Barnes; Dick Davis; Ellen Bryant Voigt; Gibbons Ruark; Cathy Smith Bowers; David Mason; Bin Ramke; Andrea Hollander Budy; Kathryn Stripling Byer; Fred Chappell; Kelly Cherry. Not a lot more.  The bad inevitably crowds out almost all the good, particularly when many readers are still trying to emulate Sylvia Plath or Anne Sexton or the odious John Ashberry; or they just use modern lingo indiscriminately or they write about politics, feminism ad infinitum, ad nauseam. Or they write what they read and hear in Creative Writing classes and workshops that ubiquitously litter our land with slop and slag.   Avoid Mr. Gilbert: read good poetry (And if you can't stand to be told what to read: listen to Mahler, Mozart, Bach). You could also do a lot worse than read Shakespeare or Cormac McCarthy. 
 If there was a prozac for books, this book would need a dose of it. Dumb, pointless plot. Dumb, pointless characters. A substandard effort from Pohl, who is one of my favorite authors 
 I don't know what book those other reviewers read, but I was put this on the shelf in 5 minutes.  Much is written in Greek.  I tried keeping up with a Greek Interlinear Bible on the computer, but still couldn't make sense of it.  The author assumes you can understand Greek.  If you're not a Greek scholar, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.  Major disappointment 
 this album i found in someone's cd case my friend found and he gave it to me. then i found this i popped it in and i wasn't surpised because it came out in the bad boy era 1998 and i wasn't really feelin this cd but the only songs that i really liked was Wise Guys For Life and Tommy's Theme from the belly soundtrack featuring LOX   
 This audio book would be much better read than listened to. There are certain areas that you will not be interested in, and some areas you'll want to read over and over again 
 Please, you guys. Stop recording new CD's. We have plenty of Matheney CD's. The music world is flooded with CD's that will never be as great as the Brandenburg Concertoes by Bach. Matheney's music has grown stale like moldy bread. The trouble with jazz is that it's just finger food for people with enormous egos. We don't need another Matheney - whomever duo CD. Go and buy the music for 18 musicians by steve reich. Now that's stunning music. All of my pat matheney cd's have a layer of dust because I don't play them anymore. Give up, Pat. Try something else. YOu've left your legacy back in the 70's. Give up 
 My little one got her fingers stick it the toy. I had to tape it off. Still not a very fun toy at all 
 While I appreciated and generally agreed with the thesis Richard Florida puts forward that creativity is important for society, there were many times when I found his writing `style' to be annoying.  I had almost put the book down after completing the first third of it.  Mr. Florida's sensitivity to criticism and unabashed need to respond to every negative comment he received from his first book made me wonder just how narcissistic this man was.  His ego flows onto each page and sometimes, in my view, gets in the way of his work and feeds a perception that he is not completely objective.  There are many points that get overlooked in his analysis.  Why are people gravitating to Austin, Texas?  Mr. Florida postulates it is because the city is open to new ideas and diverse.  While I am certain that there are people who choose to relocate based on perceptions of how open and diverse a given area is, it makes more sense to look at more practical motivators such as taxes, real estate prices, crime rates, or climate.  Tangible factors such as these get little mention.  The assumption made by Mr. Florida is that a heterogeneous, open society is more creative than a homogenous, closed one.  I guess that Japan and South Korea don't count.  I could go on, but I would not recommend this book.  
 I'm a Beatle fan from way back.  Love them, will forever! As such, I buy every book about them, I have for years!  A couple of years ago, this Hieronimus non-book came out.  What a DISSAPOINTMENT!!! So BORING! Over and over again... the same info. It was like the author, Hieronimus (Bosch?) was some kind of street reporter, getting reactions from people who wanted to do nothing but sing their own praises.  What a BORE!  I couldn't believe such a trashy book would in any way start to explain how such a classic picture came to be, and it certainly didn't!  And then to top it all, something I've never seen before in a book, advertising in the last pages!!  The entire book is a study in bad taste, and that muddy cover which is hard to believe was done by Heinz Edelman.  But there is good news!!!  Last spring, another book came out on the Making of the Yellow Submarine.  It's called UP PERISCOPE YELLOW by Al Brodax and it's just FANTASTIC!!!  For one thing it's AUTHENTIC, written by the producer who was there, and knew the Beatles for a long time, he also produced their TV cartoons.  It's clear that the wonderful stories he tells in his book (Al Brodax) came out of the close relationship he had with the Beatles.  There are pictures in the book of Brodax and Segal working on the script, (Brodax was one of the co-writers) with Ringo playing the piano for him and Eric, with Brodax arguing with Paul about the script, etc...  He knew them well.  UP PERISCOPE YELLOW-WHAT A READ. 
 I am not a Disney fan, I brought the set simply because I like some of the songs offered.  What a disappointment!  Music is flat, and songs are sang by your average Joe and Jane!  Coincidently, I brought this set along with Elton John's "Greatest Hits 1970 - 2002".  Compare Elton John's version of "Circle Of Life" to this set's makes me want to throw this set out of window 
 See my review of his other waste of time for more detail.  I have met his guy and know that he is just a terrible trader.  Everyone made (and lost) in the late nineties into 2000.  The key to successful trading is having a set of methods that can work in any market, or at least keep your losses limited during tough times.  This book niether provides any insight into profitable strategies that work today or lessons on how to keep losses to a minimum (in fact I KNOW that his guys averages his losing trades...losers average losers, mark).  Avoid this waste of your time. Spend toime reading the educational resources on your own brokers website instead.  Its free 
 I wish I read the reviews before I bought this thing, unfortunately.  Extremely user unfriendly to connect and disconnects itself often; kills batteries even in sleep mode.    The size and precision is good when it does work, but definitely not worth the money.  I exchanged it for a new one thinking it was just the first unit, but still terrible 
 Saw the previews of the first movie, but I wasn't expecting too much from that. I tried to finish both the first and the second, but that didn't work out too well...I felt these films didn't deserved to be watched all the way to the end. I don't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie, and that includes the first. All I really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it...Y'all should really consider watching Cops and those insane police chases shown on TV. After all this is just another episode of Cops with guest actors in it 
 TERRIBLE BRA.  WHAT I MISTAKE I MADE THINKING THIS WOULD WORK OUT FOR ME.  TERRIBLE FIT, NOT MADE FOR DD CUPS OR FOR THAT MATTER ANYONE OVER A B CUP....  VERY DISAPPOINTED.... 
 The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say --  The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so.  He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything.  He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet.  There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society.  
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 "the close-minded, vain beliefs that most Christians harbor. anti-intellectual" I hear this all the time from close minded pushing only one theory.   Who is the one with a closed mind? sounds obvious to me. Give us students the freedom of choice, I don't want one idea forced on me. be it evolution or intelligent design, the danger is having only one idea. What the Catholic church did at one time abused and perverting christianity for its own powers and control, this is now being done by evolution and those closed minded thinking by forcing one theory. there are only 2 options, the earth created itself, or someone created it. give me my freedom of choice. Thank you 
 Amazingly tedious for a thriller.  Reacher is a good character, believable in his expertise, but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence. The book takes too long to tell everything (and I mean everything) - it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought Reacher has (many repeated over and over). I hope Child fixed these flaws in later books. 
 I read constantly and mostly light murder mysteries-meaning nothing gory etc. Gone was very boring and I believe so is because there are just too many characters-It was difficult to keep them all straight.There didn't seem to be much of a plot until practically the end.I have read Mr Kellerman's books before and found them a lot more enteraining than this one. Also he uses words I never heard before to describe something,rather than stopping to look it up I would have to guess, otherwise I'd lose what little plot there was at the time. Also I get offended when the dirty 4 letter words are used-granted it was only by one character-but neither needed to be in the story line. 
 I had such high hopes for a book that got to the heart of my favorite city and my favorite literature. However, first it dismayed, then depressed, then just made me plain angry that Ms. Quindlen could be so superficial, so full of cliches, have such shallow skills of description and so absolutely little insight into either London or literature.  Surely someone soon will pick up the inky scratches and try again.    
 This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started.  The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all.  I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help.  It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.  So, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so 
 This was a very easy read, but in my opinion was a disturbing read. The positives about this book were few and far between and were common knowledge already. Yes we know we should be friendly to people visiting our churches, not because this book says so but because God says so. Some of Mr. slyvias principles and comments are wrong and not supported by scripture. The first statement that caught my eye was his principle of scaffolding. These are people that labor and sweat and work hard at growing the church but like scaffolding are torn down was the church is built. Please show me the biblical precedent there. The second is that Music is as important as theology because everybody already knows theology. That could possibly be the dumbest statement i have ever heard. Lost people already know all the theology? How? They certainly will not learn it in the post modern church of today. But the biggest problem i have with this book is that I feel that pastors are going to try to convert there church into a High Defination church and in the process drive out all the people that are currently there, something Mr slyvia is proud doing in only a few months. If you are a pastor and you want to start a hgh def church then I would suggest you leave your current church and start fresh so you dont destroy the "scaffolding" of your current church 
 Well, there're always the bands that evolve and change their styles. You may or may not like them, or like their style at the beginning but not later phases, and vice-versa. But this album is completely different than every other Oasis album. It has a completely different sound (I'm not saying it's bad - not my taste to be honest - but some people might like it). If you're looking for "Oasis Sound" albuns, you're looking in the wrong place. The sound here is noisy, you can see it was not worked on.  In my opinion, Oasis felt too big for their own good, and thought people would like and buy anything they did - so "why bother with the lyrics, clear sound and instrumentality that got us here?" Well, at least it's the feeling I got.  I'm a huge Oasis fan from day 1. My true, honest opinion is: you can buy absolutely ANY of their other albums and get GREAT Oasis music. In this album, you'll find something else, a sound that's not theirs. I have it, and would trade it for any of the two I don't yet have, Heathen Chemistry and Don't Believe the Truth. Totally dispensible from an Oasis collection. Bad music? Well, we each have our own tastes, so who am I to judge? If you're curious, listen to it and judge yourself! ;) But in Oasis' on words: "We'll never release s*** again! 
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 Not The Original Film. Doesn't have the original disco scene with "I like the night life" song. THEY COMPLETELY RUINED THE MOVIE 
 Purchased the item, arrived defective, replacement was also defective 
 Revisionist Drivel.  The author disregards in toto the intent, mindset, and historical context of the framers of the U.S. Constitution, then imputes whole new meanings to individual words and phrases of the Gettysburg Address, in order to support his preconceived notion as to its intent.  He slings the word Democracy with abandon, while hardly bothering to mention that the Constitution founded a Representative Republic.  Isn't it remotely possible that Lincoln was really just dedicating a cemetary, and not trying to change the focus and direction of the entire governmental structure, with a 3-minute speech 
 The story is the same and just as wonderful as it has always been.  I bought the CD version for a car trip, and was extremely disappointed in the narration.  It was read rapidly, and without pause.  I found that, even though I know the story well, I could hardly keep up!  I have several other books on CD, and have not had this problem.  Too bad... it was a waste of money, and a long boring car trip 
    One reviewer wrote the review about the "Super Ants"....this is not that movie.    This movie staring Dean Cain bites big time, unless you like movies about chases....there are several car chases, car chasing man, man chasing man, helicopter chasing car....Get the point?    The plot is strained through out the movie in dribbles... if you can make it through the endless sceens showing actors walking around doing nothing,walking or staring blankly (probably wondering if this movie will ever be over). *** Fast forward special** 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 This book has clear and precise photographs and knitting techniques.  The problem is that the typeface chosen is so hard to read, making it almost impossible to follow the patterns.  The font is too fine and too faded to read clearly.  I found my eyes were straining to read the opaque font.  When I gave the page more light, the shine on the page completely obliterated the text.  Very frustrating 
 Waxman's book makes one wonder if she really writes for the New York Times.  Any amateur film geek who's actually seen the films she writes about will find multiple errors, strange, unsupported statements, poorly written and edited sentences, and could probably write a better book themselves in short order.  That said, Waxman's interviews do give her a point of view on her six main subjects which is interesting, and some of the gossip is compelling.  Waxman badly needs an editor.  She thanks one in the acknowledgments, so apparently someone held the title, but no one much seems to have performed the function.  Had a good editor got hold of this manuscript, it might seem less like it was written in crayon in a big hurry.  Which is a shame, because it does have its moments, a few revelations, and a driving narrative.  But too much takes away from these strengths to recommend the book highly 
 Way too expensive for little in return. The same size piece of dark chocolate with the same calorie content would be just as filling. [...]      
 This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant "homemaker". If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too 
 We weren't expecting much from this one. My husband remembered it as not being great, but being tolerable. I think he was interested in the weapons in the program.  Anyway, even my husband could only get through the first five minutes. The writing is spectacularly bad. It's kind of funny in that Richard Burton clearly is drunk/hungover and hates the script as much as we do. He's practically rolling his eyes as he recites his lines.  You should only buy this if you're interested in collecting the world's worst films featuring the world's best actors 
 I was all excited about the it coming out and thought it was going to be really good. Well, it sucks!!! I regret buying it!! 
 When someone writes an autobiographical memoir, if it is honest, he bares his soul.  Frank Conroy's soul is unlovely to say the least. He writes without remorse - indeed, boastingly - of his sedulous part in a terrible hazing incident that involved the group beating of a schoolmate to the point of unconsciousness. And then he drags us through his pathetic, sloppy early liasons with girls, as if his experiences are something transcendant and unique just because they are his. One reviewer wrote hysterically that he hates women. Not true, of course.  He is simply a supreme egotist, supreme, here, meaning far beyond the norm, beyond the natural self-concerns of most people. In one lamentable episode he completely violates the trust of a loyal and heartbreakingly earnest young woman, then shows not even the slightest trace of remorse. In Frank Conroy's self-indulgent world, Frank Conroy is number one and the devil with everyone else.  This is an attitude he never outgrew. It is almost, in fact, as if he is proud of his amoral stance, as though it lends a patina of masculinity, something which he seems insecure about anyway. He was known for reducing his students to tears in his renowned Iowa Writer's Workshop. Other reviewers gush on about his writing skills.  But when a writer's heart and soul are flawed, he cannot speak truth.  Our writers and poets should be our moral and spiritual guides.  Upon acceptance of the Nobel Prize for literature, William Faulkner said: [Our writers must relearn] "the old universal truths, lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed - love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice.  Until he does so, he labors under a curse.  He writes not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars.  He writes not of the heart but of the glands." Therre is no compassion and no pity for anyone in Frank Conroy's world but himself.     
 The plot is stupid, the acting is bad, and the poker play is awful.  Painful experience to sit through the whole series.  Just watch Rounders 
 Octave Mirbeau, The Torture Garden (RE/Search, 1899)  A new edition of a nineteenth-century classic of decadence is usually a good thing, right? The problem being that nineteenth-century classics of decadence often end up reading more like Henry James-- in his long-winded later years-- than actual decadence. The Torture Garden is redeemed in this respect only by being shorter than most.  While it cannot be argued that, along with its brevity, The Torture Garden was certainly one of the most explicit books of its time, that time is long past, and one has to ask the question of whether the book has any relevance at all to the modern reader. In most cases, the answer will be no. Today, The Torture Garden is going to appeal to an extremely select group of people-- those who both hunger for the explicit and have enough tolerance for the diction of nineteenth-century writing to be able to get the explicitness out of it.  Somewhere along the way during the twentieth century, fiction got a lot less heavy on the description and replaced what was missing with an emphasis on plot. Now, normally I'm the first person to rush into the breach, screaming about how awful an idea this usually is. It leads to things like Danielle Steel selling uncounted millions of novels that are not, one presumes, being used for their most appropriate purposes (e.g., lining cat pans). However, the parallel to this is that there had to be some sort of previous description-heavy movement, and it had to lead somewhere decadent enough that the literati felt the need to rebel against it. The previous remark about Henry James in his later years is quite an excellent example of where it had led-- bloated, flowery books that weren't really about anything, in any meaningful sense of the word. The Torture Garden is one of these, minus (thankfully) some of the bloat, and literally flowery. There is much breast-beating, a good deal of horror (in the beginning, anyway) at the thought of women showing their ankles in public, the common trope of a faraway country (in this case, China) being picked as a setting because no one really knew all that much about it, and a whole lot of description, but underneath, there's really nothing at all. Worse, Mirbeau seems to have decided to ignore such things as continuity (contrast, for example, the endless, intensely boring frame at the beginning of the novel with its final page, and wonder how the narrator got from point B to point A). To the reader of the modern pornographic novel, this will not be new. In fact, it's a mark that's branded the cheap, low-quality pornographic novel... well, seemingly at least since the turn of the twentieth century. * 
 I enjoyed and learned a lot from both of Tanenbaum's OS textbooks, but this is really awful. On the one hand, the descriptions of things such as RPC are so abstract that I can't see how anyone could be expected to understand what a real RPC system would look like; on the other hand, there's not nearly enough effort made to give a picture of how the systems discussed fit into the broader context of computer science, or relate to each other.  Moreover, the book is badly written: the writing is alternately overly colloquial and overly academic in style, as if it were written by someone very smart, but for whom English is a second language 
 Might be a great product.  I can't be sure.  Because, uh...hello?...mine didn't come with any instructions whatsover.  I opened it up and I was like, "ah...hello?  Where are the instructions?"  But the Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze did not answer my questions.  If anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions, I would greatly appreciate it.  Until then my Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze is just gonna sit there, not being used, like my box of floss, a bag of onions, and my heart. 
 When I sit down in the theater to watch a film I start with a neutral rating of zero so that the movie itself can then take me up the star rating, or down.  I rate differently than most.  I do it, for my purposes, in a much better way.  Trust me.  You should try it. Start out neutral then be mutable.  Go up or down with your rating as the movie progresses.  At the end of the day you will come up with what is a personally more accurate composite rather than a final, less step-by-step derived method of judgment.  If only waiting until the end to state your case, much of your case cannot be stated. You will come up with a more accurate impression if the film is evaluated as you go. Very important also, is the type of rating.  Never limit yourself to the typical zero-to-five star confinement.  Always allow yourself a much more realistic range of from a minus ten stars, up to a plus ten stars, or at the very least, a negative five up ten to a plus five stars.  You will like it better, personally.  You know very well you have seen a movie where zero stars is simply not low enough.  This movie:  I generally have a difficult time recovering up into the plus-star level on my movie score card rating, back into the positive rating category, when I consider the overall rating ultimately given, when in the first few minutes I am abused by a movie in the way this one burnt.  It is not a good sign, or indicator of good quality to come, when a deranged, icky creep in his underwear comes out of the bathroom in someone else's house, screeches, shoots the lead actor in the gut then commits suicide after blithering back into the bathroom.  It wasn't scary.  It wasn't a harbinger of great things to come.  It was just crude, offensive and a cheap way to get intellectually challenged viewers to want more. Right off the bat this is a gross, totally classless way to abuse a captive audience paying for, hopefully a well thought out storyline, artfully delivered.  The art of movie making was sacrificed in favor of a blood and guts in your face introduction.  Sitting with my wife I told her, within five minutes of the opening curtain, that B. Willis "was one of them."  She waited until near the end and asked me how I knew that so soon.  "Well, my first clue," I says, "was when he (Willis) was shot dead on his own bed by the underwear-guy with the concave chest during the offensive first scene, just before he splattered his own blood and brains all over the bathroom as far out into the bedroom as possible."  Think about it:  from that opening scene on Willis did not interact with anyone the way normal people interact, even if one stretches reality in order to conceive the acceptance. Subsequent interactions were not right and very obviously so.  Now, don't misunderstand.  I have seen many films that are filled with all kinds of gritty gore and head squashing.  This particular film was so low class in its attempt to shock the viewers that it was simply disgusting.   Believe it or not, the classless opening is not the main reason upon which I rate this movie a minus nine stars.  The reason is this: The single most predominant cause of my disliking this film is philosophical in nature.  That is, I do not like any message that implies that we, ourselves, are not responsible for what affects our lives.  Everyone would love to get off easy for their own actions that have led to poor conditions within which they themselves find. Yielding the responsibility for our behavior, and course of our lives,  blaming our own individual predicaments on other forces, by us uncontrollable and subject to another force, or entity, is the biggest excuse for self produced bad circumstances that mankind has ever used, the most often used, that is.  Uneducated people, those that haven't been around, haven't traveled, are not well-read, do not see or hear or care to understand the world and their place in it, hoping to blame something else for their resultant condition, they eat this up.  It is too frightening for them to face their action's consequences so just love to excuse themselves from their own equation catalyzed by this type of tripe.  The completely erroneous idea that what will be will be or what will happen happens is rooted in certain, "Eastern Philosophies," based on the idea that man is inconsequential in his own environment and might just as well not try to improve his own conditions since what is gong to be will be no matter what.  The "Western Philosophy of Life", where what happens to us depends a great deal upon how hard we work at being and becoming what we want to be, is the main reason those cultures seeing the world and life and our place in it in that way, that are light years ahead of societies which have been around for thousands of years longer.  If water is not delivered by pipes directly into our homes then it was not meant to be, and why fight what is meant to be?  If sewage is not drained from our homes by pipes to be deposited in recycling plants then it is useless for us to change what is into what might be better since it is the way it is since what is, is. What results of this approach, if these views of life are taken as unalterable facts, is that no motivation exists to stop from lazily sitting and watching life go by being what it will be.  This film sends a message that other forces make puppets out of us, so our screw ups are not our blame. That's a bad way to approach life.     Bad.    Even if the premise of this film is accepted, the positive reasons for the sixth sense to exist at all were left on the cutting room floor.  The examples of the workings of the mechanism that might even slightly imply why things were OK to be the way the film portrayed were left out.  Go figure.  One could lie to himself with that assumption, albeit erroneous, if why what was the main theme of the movie had been even somewhat justified. 
  i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star. 
 This is a great show with great writing and acting.  Unfortunatly I had to purchase & return this 3 times (season 1).  Once from Circuit City, twice from Amazon. The 1st disc freezes and skips and is basically unwatchable.  I think Amazon should pull his item from its inventory and complain to the manufacturer. They should have never put this on a double sided dvd 
 I was really disappointed when this item arrived.  It is cute and well made, but barely holds a pound of pasta.  This is more suited for single servings or wall decor, but I wanted a large heavy duty colander.  Oh well 
 This magazine took a radical change in direction earlier this year, meaning most reviews prior to April 2006 are essentially reviewing a different magazine.  I was a subscriber since the early 90's and have recently cancelled.  This magazine had a mid (end of life?) crisis and now wants to cover just about anything that uses electricity.  And cars!  Why would I pick up PC Magazine to read a car review?  Their "improved" layout uses cartoonish hand drawn arrows and "cool" sayings to replace actual review content.  What is their market here?  12 year old geeks with an extra $80k laying around to drop on an SUV?  Get real.  Until this magazine makes another radical change in direction to get back on topic, it is best avoided 
 I once had a cheap shaver I got at Sears that I learned was made for Sears by Remington. I liked that shaver, so when I found the R-950 at Sears on sale for $40, I decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver. Big mistake. After 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck (especially with drier winter skin), not to mention the occasional cut lip I get with the R-950 while trying to shave around the mouth, I am going back to my old shaver. How can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave... but it does. 
 Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series.  As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really "jumps the shark", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the "corrupt rich guy" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space.  Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead 
 As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time. Chillout 2001 thru Chillout 8 was very good in comparison. This CD is not a complete disaster, however, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating. Quite a few 4/5 star songs however, lots of 2-3 star songs. Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.   I think the people that rated this 4 or 5 stars don't own a lot of lounge/chill and are probably a lot easier to please. I'm very dissapointed. Maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) Oh well...   I highly recomend any of the CDs in this set before this one. In fact, Chillout sessions 7 was SUPERB!!!  
 I found this book incredibly boring. While it is obvious that Leddick gets into his characters, I did not. I found them two-dimensional, hollow cliches lacking in authenticity. Mr. Leddick should do more research and try to imbue his characters with more dimensions and distinct voices. I would suggest that he write porn instead, but even the sex scenes in the book are unrewarding, unerotic and unarousing. On the plus side, the guy on the cover is quite tasty and fortunately legal. Someone should just put together a coffee table book of covers of gay novels. I am sure that it would be more stimulating than a great deal of the novels themselves 
 I would have preferred a sample page of the music to preview prior to purchase.  The pieces are too simple for me. 
 My review is two thumbs down.  It might help a total novice at the game, but it provides nothing for people who know anthing about poker 
 Well, if you want to read the experience from academia, go right ahead. For a better insight, see Michael Beschloss or Ike's own biographer, Stephen Ambrose. This book was a hit in the scholastic arena but never  caught on in mainstrea 
 Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the "desperate", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore. 
 SAY HELLO TO  queens of the stone age.personally i dont like bands as qotsa,but must admit that finch did an amazing job with plagiating many ideas from this band!!!!!!this record is tooooooooooo complex  and "unoriginal".rip,fnch.just another "one hit wonder" band 
 thats exactly how this album feels! you know, some irish songs and influences are good, but this is ridiculous. when 95% of your lyrical content is irish at least keep it interesting.(spicy mchaggis jig??? what the....?) so i say if your even interested in this cd or something 95% irish, get drunken lullabies or swagger by flogging molly instead, if you dont already have them. id also recommend the new murphys cd "the warriors code" if you want faster irish music done good. i give it 2 stars because its not nearly as bad as some of the other stuff out there. oh yeah rocky road to dublin kicks arse....thats about the only reason to even put this cd on. easily the worst DKM albu 
 Of the over fifty books on leadership/coaching that I've read, this is by far the least useful.  There are anecdotes for basketball fans, but as far as useful ideas on success and leadership there are few.  It is the most useless book I've read in the coaching/leadership field (even worse than Coach K's or Dean Smith's). 
 Not worth the time or money. Nothing new, not even the title 
 Don't buy this book.  Unfortunately I did.  This book is at best an       amateurish attempt at writing.  It is simplistic in plot with little to no character development.  Poe is probably turning over in his grave at the cheap references to his literature to promote blood and gore without complementing his ability to develop and build suspense into his works.  I bought this book based on the rating and review published in the Denver, CO "Rocky Mountain News."   Mystery readers--stay with P.D.James or Dan Brown 
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
  Don't get me wrong. The deck is great if you happen to be a Wiccan or follow a form of Paganism that is very Wiccan in style.  The problem is in the deck being advertised as good for all pagans.  With the cards referring to: The Maiden, Mother and Crone; The Threefold Law; The Words of the Magus; The Horned God and other concepts that are found only in Wiccan styled paganism it makes it as foreign to Germanic, Slavic, Celtic, Egyptian, Greeko-Roman and Middle Easter paganism as the decks the Well Worn Path was designed to replace. In fact in some cases more so! Especially when you count on Hermeticism connection to the Mediterranean faiths.  Other than this the deck is excellent. Just like many pagans from the not-Wiccan camps I'm tired of books, decks and articles trying to paint us all the same. It's becoming eerily like Fundamentalist Christian groups passing off non-denominational prayers turning control of our lives to 'our Father in Heaven, the most supreme God.' Then claiming it is appropriate for all faiths.  It's not that I have anything against Wicca, it's just of all the Pagan denominations it's adherents are the ones most likely to state that some aspect of there faith applies to all pagans and/or witches and anyone not following them isn't a REAL pagan/witch. This a trend I'm glad to see is dying down. 
 I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.  They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk, yet the other styles fit me perfectly.  Great idea, but they should have worked on it more.  I can't wear these outside the house 
 I bought this book for my wife upon the birth of our child. We travel often and were hoping for some actual information that would help us TRAVEL with our baby, we already knew what to pack when visiting our neighbor. We were bored out of our minds listening to stories about the author's 'little junior'- don't waist your money on this one! We are still looking for a book with REAL information concerning the technicalities of traveling with our baby 
 This film was dreadful.  Streisand is absolutely unlikeable.  To enjoy this film, you would need to buy into the romance between Streisand and Nolte and I just can't see how that is possible.  I couldn't believe it when I found out how critically acclaimed this film was.  Along with The English Patient, this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed' films I have ever had the displeasure of viewing 
 If a "suspense" filmed was played in the woods, and it didn't actually contain any suspense, would a bear watch it?   The previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making "Domestic Disturbance", the newest `thriller' starring John Travolta, Vince Vaughn and Teri Polo.   Let's talk for a few minutes about Mr. Travolta. Can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them? I think that Travolta has now surpassed Richard Dreyfuss as the comeback/ lose it again king. After a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer Quentin Tarantino in "Pulp Fiction", Travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices. "Face/Off" and "Broken Arrow" highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed Travolta to join the $20 million club. In the last few years, every film Travolta has appeared in has failed miserably. "Lucky Numbers"? "The General's Daughter"? That film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it? "Swordfish"? Interesting, but a flop. "Battlefield Earth"? Why does he keep making this trash? It has to be the paychecks. I can't see any other conceivable reason. John, baby, how long before the studios realize that these films aren't making any money and they stop hiring you? John, baby, how long before you need another comeback vehicle?   Frank Morrison (John Travolta) is a divorced father who makes wooden boats. He doesn't get a lot of business, but the business that he does get gets a great deal. He doesn't charge his customers enough to make a profit. Frank does this because HE IS THE GOOD GUY. His son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary) has a lot of problems accepting his mom's (Teri Polo) new relationship with Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). He gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone. A couple of days after his mom and Rick get married, he stows away in Rick's car and witnesses him murdering a business associate. The police don't believe him however. After a little soul searching, Frank believes his son. He may lie to everyone, but he doesn't lie to Frank.   Directed by Harold Becker ("Sea of Love"), "Domestic Disturbance" is a suspense film without any suspense. From the moment Danny stows away in Rick's car and WATCHES HIM MURDER Ray (Steve Buscemi), which we also watch, we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is. To make matters worse, Frank instantly believes his son, which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between Frank and Rick. A boring cat and mouse game. When you know the identity of the villain, a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet. When Frank believes Danny early on, the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it.   The film would've been greatly improved by showing Danny in the backseat of the car, watching everything, the pain and suspense registering on his face, while the audience sees nothing. Then, when Danny tries to convince his dad, the police chief, his mom, that Rick is a murderer, at least we haven't seen the act, and we would require some convincing as well.   Because the filmmakers chose to show us everything, the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have Frank doubt Danny, his son. However, after a very brief segment, Frank believes Danny, causing us to watch a battle between Frank and Rick, which isn't very interesting.   Each of the actors, including Travolta, are serviceable in their roles, but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes, the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium.   Skip "Domestic Disturbance". It isn't even worthy of a video rental. Go to see the far superior and very different "Amelie" or "The Man Who Wasn't There". Your money will be much better spent. 
 I saw this book in the book store the other night and almost bought it.  Norman Jewison was on the TCM documentary of Steve McQueen, seemed like a nice guy with some fascinating stories, and I thought it would be interesting to read about his career and all the celebrities he has worked with.  I thumbed through the book, reading bits and pieces.  On the back cover was a praising review from Gore Vidal - Strike 1.  Below that was a praising review from Cher - Strike 2.  Inside was a picture of Jewison with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - Strike 3.  Not to mention the book states John Wayne supposedly called Jewison a "pinko Canadian."  Also not to mention a few other things I found offensive.  I put the book back on the shelf, kept looking and wound up buying "Capote," about the life of Truman Capote.  He was a Southerner, a writer, hob-nobbed with the rich and famous, and on the back book cover it said he had a feud with Gore Vidal.  Home run. 
 I have an Iriver T10 and there is virtually no software to support the USB plug and play interface that Mac owners have always expected. Pay a little more and buy an IPOD.  It interfaces with PCs and Macs equally well. 
 	Junie B. Jones goes to first grade at last!  If you liked Junie B. Jones in Kindergarten, you'll love her in first grade. I know I did! I like Junie B. because she's a trouble maker. She always has an excuse for everything. She goes on little adventures which hardly work out well. If you like trouble, go to your local library and get Junie B. Jones Goes to First Grade at Last 
 A high school guidance counselor could write a better job hunting book then this! Dr. Mornell has so little to say he resorted to using a huge 14 pt type font so he could fill up 187 pages.   His best answer for the standard "What are your five-year goals?" is " You can evaluate my work in three, six, or twelve months - and if it's excellent, we can decided how to best use my talents within the company." In my opinion this answer is vague and shows the job candidate has no ambition, no incentive to take ownership of his career, no plan and no sense of direction.   If you are serious about finding a job, order "Knock 'em Dead 2001" by Martin Yale and get serious answers from a pro on really tough interview questions 
 I opened this book very neutrally--I had never heard anything about Susan Sontag except her name, in a preface to an Annie Leibovitz book.  I still can't believe some of the things I read.  Sontag mentions in the foreword that she has an "obsession" with photography.  I would argue that she has an obsession with resenting photography. She begins by comparing a camera to a gun and the act of taking a picture to rape.  To a certain point, I can understand this--being photographed is a very self-conscious experience.  But somehow, I think rape victims would laugh at this comparision.  Self-consciousness is not exactly rape.  Also, she seems to believe that all photography is taken completely without the consent of the subject(s); they are innocent victims being raped by guns.  The last time I checked, most of the photographers she mentions (Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Edward Weston, Julia Margaret Cameron) took pictures only with express permission, and many (Eugene Atget, Ansel Adams, etc.) did not take pictures of people at all.  Almost all good pictures, with the exception of Henri Cartier-Bresson type photography, requires tacit consent between photographer and subject.   Sontag's resentment seems to come mostly from the resentment generated by photography's replacement of writing in description.  Specifically, she says that whereas photograpy "steals" the pain of others, writing uses only one's own pain.  This is funny, since I remember reading about how Jane Austen's neighbors complained because their lives were being stolen for her books.  Ever since the art of storytelling began writers and storytellers have been "stealing" other people's lives, their pain, etc.  Fitzgerald used Zelda's insanity just as David Bailey photographed Marie Helvin.  I believe that the art of writing and the art of photography are incredibly similar, and Sontag sounds very sour grapes.  How is Strand's photographing the famous "Blind Woman" different from Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood?" My biggest objection to Sontag, however, is her lack of either proof or explanation.  She simply states opinions as if they were facts, and then stops.  For example, according to Sontag, Weston is now regarded as antiquated and cliche.  Really?  Somehow I thought, considering the worth of his work, his exhibitions in museums, and the wealth of books devoted to him, as well as his inclusion in every basic photography class, that he was still very highly regarded.  I'm sure that Sontag regards him as antiquated and cliche, but this is very different from the "everyone" she generally to be present and in full agreement with her. Sontag also concentrates exclusively on one genre and attacks photography as a whole through that genre.  Diane Arbus's photos are apparently taking horrible advantage of everyone pictured in them, and are freakish visions of a bleak world--therefore all photographs in the world are taking horrible advantage and are freakish visions of a bleak world.  I can understand why some people find Arbus's photos terribly offensive, but I think only the extremely deluded would use her as representative of all photography. One last aspect of Sontag's book, which I found the most offensive, is her assumption that a picture is stealing the pain of others and, in a sense, profiting from it artistically.  This is despite her inclusion in her "Anthology of Quotations" of Richard Avedon's interview where he stated that the pictures he took of other people were more about him than about them.  Everyone who has ever practiced photography with any passion can testify to the truth of this statement, hence my conclusion that Sontag has probably never really picked up a camera.  Look at Avedon's pictures of a tortured Marilyn Monroe, and then read Arthur Miller's "After the Fall," which describes a tortured and pill-popping Marilyn Monroe.  There is very little difference, except that in Avedon's pictures Monroe still retains some amount of dignity, whereas in Miller's play she becomes a demon of hysteria and cruelty.  In the end, although I am both a photographer and a writer, I would say that writing has ten times the power of misrepresentation and "stealing the pain of others" than does photography 
 Every review I've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just don't get it.  No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it, and by then you're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters, it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next.  If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal.  Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases.  I have to wonder what they could be: "Damned Melon!" or "I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!"???  I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether.  In sum, don't waste your time 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 A bit cheesey... I felt like I was reading a fluffed up self-help book! If you are a fan of The Da Vinci Code looking for more information on the lost sacred feminine, this book will be of little help.  I bought it because I thought it would be an interesting way to absorb some facts, but I found it to be a simplistic, repetetive, overly-idealized account of a woman's "rebirth".  I couldn't even finish it!  While its okay as a light read, it won't satisfy your want of solid religious/historical information 
 For one thing Cantor claims the ancient Greeks were so gay. I dipute that. I think ancient Greeks were just living in a very temperature-wise hot, sunny climate and as a result were often semi-nude or even nude with people of the same sex. The affection the same sex showed each other was traditional and very most likely didn't usually include the act of doing it. Also, on other homosexual points it's somewhat wrong of Cantor to point out gay English kings. Even though a defense of this could be that Cantor was only pointing a fact in this instance I have studied medieval history for years and never before heard of this terrible fact of these particular English monarchs engaging in the Bibilically sinful act of homosexuality. A personal point on something different I also got of bored of hearing how English and Spanish people ate. Hey neither of these groups are noted for their great food (tacos are mexican food). Talk more about what italians ate in the middle ages please! Cantor has done better writing. I prefer his book on the plague to this one by far!    
 I think this CD was misrepresented - probably unintentionally. I thought I was purchasing a CD by the 70's band, Chase. The CD I received is NOT that band. Its a female - soulful - type music. Not bad if you like that kind of stuff - but, I don't. So, I am not very happy with this purchase 
 this book doesn't even deserve 1 star! i would give it a negative number of stars if i could! this book is awful! i read fifty pages and couldn't take it any more! the caracters are unoriginal! the plot is a cheap wannabe of something great that leaves you feeling like an easily amused simpleton for attempting to read it in the first place!!! honestly if you want to read some good, fullfilling fantasy, read something with a little depth to it read something good like 'Lord of the Rings' or 'the firebringer trilogy' or 'the Bartimaeus Trilogy' at least they have something original to them! 
 As a vegan, I have tried just about every tofu product on the market, and nothing ever came close to the terrible texture of these noodles.  The smell when you opened the bag was not pleasant, but if you wash them off and parboil, that goes away, but is replaced with a slightly sweet smell that I disliked almost as much.  But I kept an open mind, cooked the noodles for a few minutes, added my favorite sauce and fresh ground pepper with some soy cheese grated on top.  Whoever said it was like eating rubber bands was exactly on target, they are incredibly chewy and just don't taste that great either. Even as a low calorie food, it seems like a waste to spend 40 calories on these noodles. 
 Waxman's book makes one wonder if she really writes for the New York Times.  Any amateur film geek who's actually seen the films she writes about will find multiple errors, strange, unsupported statements, poorly written and edited sentences, and could probably write a better book themselves in short order.  That said, Waxman's interviews do give her a point of view on her six main subjects which is interesting, and some of the gossip is compelling.  Waxman badly needs an editor.  She thanks one in the acknowledgments, so apparently someone held the title, but no one much seems to have performed the function.  Had a good editor got hold of this manuscript, it might seem less like it was written in crayon in a big hurry.  Which is a shame, because it does have its moments, a few revelations, and a driving narrative.  But too much takes away from these strengths to recommend the book highly 
 I wish I came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie, we own the original (non 3D version) and she knew the 3D version was the same movie but was excited about the 3D aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it.    We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...  Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.  Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release 
 I also bought this book because of high praise here. After going through it several times, I am forced to conclude that it has been of no help at all in planning my visit to SE Asia.  
 I bought this item from Best Buy.  It works great until it was time to change the batteries.  The battery cover is hard to open, which caused a back piece to break off.  Since then, the mouse did not work anymore.  I would not recommend this mouse 
 The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them.   The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective. Even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place. The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well. Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite 
 This is the worst looking DVD I've ever seen. I loved the movie; I was delighted to see it, and bought it right away. I knew it was old and the SFX would be dated, no problem. But... watching it was like dragging fingernails over a blackboard. It jitters. It blurs. It hiccups. The color is bad.  The only other DVD I've ever run into that was even close to this bad was "The Final Countdown"; I can't help but think this DVD is actually defective in some way, except for the fact that it plays continuously without any complaints from my hardware.  So... if you loved Outland, I guess this is what you have to buy, but man... be prepared for a sub-sub-sub-optimal experience 
 I have been reading James Patterson's books since the first Alex Cross came out. I thought the first 3 or 4 Cross books were brilliant but since then I feel the standard has dropped gradually to where we reach London Bridges.  This book has a solid storyline that needed fleshing out but I think the author was in too much of a rush to get the book on the shelves to worry about the story.  Let me get this right - Alex's family are taken hostage in the final few pages of the book, we get a couple of pages devoted to Cross' work and then the family is returned. There was no discussion on the anguish Alex was facing, nothing on the fear that the family was facing, nothing written about this at all! It would have been better to have taken them at the start of the book and have the book devoted to the fear that Alex was facing and his determination to catch the Wolf and get his family back.  If Alex was so dedicated to catching the Wolf, why was he taking so many time-outs throughout the book to visit little Alex, have dinner with his numerous friends etc?  Most disappointing, Mr Patterson 
  . . . and more nonsense.  Like I've stated in previous reviews, the only reason I read any of this c**p is because as a professional Christian educator and theologian, questions about stuff like this come up far more often than I would like -- and I've gotta have my ammo ready.  Here we go again:  Dispensational pre-millinalism, which is the theology presented in the book as "authentic" Christianity, was invented out of whole cloth in the mid 19th century.  This is not the faith of the Apostles.  This is not the faith of the Early Church (East or West).  This is not the faith of the Reformers.  Luther and Calvin would have rejected this.  This is not the faith of the Great Awakening.  Wesley and Whitfield would have rejected this.  Even in Protestantism, this represents a minority "out there" viewpoint.  A non-Christian who picks up one of these books and believes that it represents mainstream Christianity will be grossly deceived.  This is not honest theology; this is not honest biblical interpretation; and the writing is horrible to boot 
 It was interesting to read a review that commented " It is still true, you can not find any study in those countries about Christianity".  That statement is absolute fiction of course - especially in the 33 Jesuit schools in Syria. Perhaps in the west, it has slipped our minds that Jesus was born in the middle east, and we adopted this middle east religion from them.... The eastern Churches very much study Christianity, and many Muslims around them in the Levant, since Jesus is reverred in Islam. John the Baptist's head is maintained in a memorial monument in the middle of the Ommayad Mosque in Damascus.  The most noted manuscripts used for our common bibles today, were discovered in Alleppo (Syria).  Cursory research reveals Lewis's connections to Intelligence, and that speaks for itself. This book should be read, to balance it, in conjunction with 'Hostage to Khomeini' and 'Venice's War Against Western Civilization', unless one wishes to be taken for a very sophisticated ride. Better still, one could reside in the middle east for a while and see for one's self instead of amplifying other people's writings without the slightest ability, credential or experience to determine whether or not they might be accurate. But be ready for shock - it has little in common to the Psy-Ops portraits we have been spoon-fed with by western media, moronic television porgammes (suchas Fox), and artful books such as this.    It's still a fine read, and awfully convincing - it hit it's mark in that respect. Much knowledge on Christianity - one wonders of the author hails from Christian ancestors ?   Continuing the other review - that people in the middle east would supposedly benefit greatly from reading this book was also amusing, to say the least. People from the Middle East would benefit best from a good lawyer and a truth serum, given the looting and plunder of their resources.. 
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 only in very small letters, INSIDE  the book, they say it is "THE ARMCHAIR DETECTIVE 2". Since I allready had that book, now i have two copies of the same book. VERY BAD PRACTICE OF THE PUBLISHERS. DONT BUY IT IF YOU ALLREADY HAVE THE ACD2 
 Yes, it was intended as a "fun" read (literature of the absurd?) and it did evoke several chuckles, especially at the first.  But as literature (read into that word what you will) it's an abysmal failure. Crammed with so many jokes, puns, outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action, one's interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices. It's a case where you can't see the forest for all the intervening trees.   I had expected a "straight" tale similar to the Alienist.  Then when I discovered it was a humorous take on the police procedural I perked up.  It was only after the 100th hyperbole and cutesy 20th century reference that I grew weary of the whole thing.  Toward the end it descended into caricature.  What's sad is that the idea was a good one - maybe the author should stick to SNL and the visual media.  In fact, the book seemed very visual, almost as if the author were transcribing a SNL skit 
 It does give you some hints, but it isn't that technical. It's more an "imitate me" book than a "understand it" book. To me it wasn't very illustrative...   The exercises are a little bit ridiculous, so it's kind of hard to try to practice if you don't want to bother any nearby person or neighbor, or if you get easily embarrassed.  Right now I'm reading "The New Voice: How to Sing and Speak properly"  and it seems more reasonable, it talks about making your voice before singing, instead of making it as you sing... like in this book.  I will give it a 2, because it does help you improve, but this book doesn't cover the "understand everything that is happening" part good enough for me 
 The content and design of this thick book is great.  Unfortunately the quality of the manufacture of this book in no way reflects the  merchandise produced by PRADA.  Prior to removing the book from the shrink-wrapped plastic it was obvious that a stain from the glue had soaked thru the cover.  After reading the volume for about 30 minutes the cover completely seperated from pages.  Utterly disappointing. 
 The country music crowd built the Chicks up, then they went to England and showed their true side.  As a result country music lovers, true to their country, turned on the Chicks; so now the Chicks say that their music isn't country.  I say that their music isn't music but it just noise 
 I would just like to add my note of agreement with the reviews of Michael A. Gatto and Bill Marsano and add one additional rather major error in "Stolen Figs"; on page 92, "After Hannibal came the Longobards, the Byzantines, and, in the middle of the sixth century, the Normans,...". How's that for turning history on its head? And he's only about five centuries off with the Normans. Conclusion? A complete waste of time 
 Characters are flat. I don't really care about the Art and Music.  Murder mystery was so boring I found out that I didn't care who killed him.  Read 3/4 of the book and shut the pages 
 So there were lots of great parts of this book, and lots of relevant historical information, and, at times, it really shines.  How paved streets came about in London, for example, the Macaroni fashions, and other important historical phenomena are covered and are covered pretty well.  However, the book does not read well at all.  You will find yourself reading and re-reading and re-reading again.  Good information, but not very digestable, and the conclusion needs work, as it's difficult to see the relations of all of the "spaces. 
 Leonard Bernstein was indeed a great exponent of Mahler's music, especially during the sixties. But, I am sad to say, he was not always its best interpreter. Bernstein's presentations of Mahler are often big and bold - or, in other words, overloaded - and occasionally he even adds instrumental effects just to make the music to sound even more swollen (consider, for example, the addition of a bass drum stroke in the ultimate chord of symphony no. 1). Passages that require sophistication are often underlined with broad, syrup-sentimental strokes. This is especially the case with these late Mahler recordings, which Bernstein made for DG.   In some people's taste, this is just wonderful. They want showpieces and nothing else. But other people might have other intuitions regarding Mahler's music. For example, they want orchestral balance and not too deliberate takes.   Now this DG set is incredibly expensive - $191! My advice, if you want a set with Bernstein's Mahler, is to look for the set with his earlier recordings for CBS/SONY. You get it for a third of the price ($ 63), and the interpretations are usually far better in all respects (with the exception of No. 5).   But if you just want the best box with the complete symphonies of Gustav Mahler, I would recommend Rafael Kubelik's set (DG collectors series) as the first choice. Kubelik's interpretations are far more balanced and presented without mannerism, and, overall, his set is more consistent than any of Bernstein's. For reference, you could then add the selected gems of Bernstein's early Mahler recordings: Nos. 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.  Thus I give two stars for this DG set, three stars for the earlier CBS/SONY set, and four stars for Kubelik's set. 
 This author obviously has a political and religious agenda. For anyone today to seriously believe that anyone than Muslim Arab terrorists perpetrated the most heinous terrorist incident in history is just moronic. His "proofs" are all worthless inuendo, and remind me of some of the nonsense I read on snopes.com. It's pretty amazing what some people will believe. For those reviewers who think this book is important, let alone factual, I've got this great bridge to sell you...  Don't waste your cash on this trash 
 Honestly, I can't really remember the first two because it has been so long since I seen them.... But I doubt  this one was the best. We have Bruce Springsteens sister going around killing all the teens in the camp that  commits sins. Well, I'll say that there is a few semi original killings here. But there is no reason to root for anyone in the film other than the killer. The asian girl is totally annoying as is the rest of the cast.  This movie in some ways attempt to be a horror movie and in other ways it wanted to be a spoof movie. Reality is that it failed on both accounts as it isn't scary or really that funny 
 No wonder John Gardner didn't write more fiction books.  He was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction, rather than actually writing it.  "Creative atrophy" I believe John Gardner himself would call it.  If there's ever been a better example of the "those who can't do, teach" argument, I haven't encountered it.  This is hardly the place a "Young Writer" should start.  Instead, how about reading what you like and avoiding "ignoramouses" such as John Gardner?  John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world's finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn't have the luxury of a "rigorous classical education."   The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.  It's interesting to note how Gardner, who "taught" creative writing at the university level, fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education 
 The backgrond information was interesting, however it did not make up for the mistakes in the restaurant section, etc.  I found the book confusing and inaccurate on a number of occaisions.  The book also lists only a smattering of hotels and restaurants which was very frustrating.  For example, the book states that Gabrielle's Restaurant is on the "edge of the French Quarter" which could be further from the truth.  The restaurant is far past Rampart St., which is the edge of the French Quarter.  The bok also lists the St. Louis Cemetaries No. 1 & 2 in the Garden District.  This also could be farther from the truth.  Save your ... for a book on N.O. with accurate info 
 Being a big fan of Grant's unique guitar playing, I've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music.  As far as I know, this is the only book about him.  The book doesn't go into a great amount of  detail.  The discography and selected reviews are worth reading.  I'd say  your best bet to understanding Grant Green would be to spend the money you  would plunk down on this book on a good CD of his- Idle Moments, Green  Street, The Complete Quartets with Sonny Clark. Then you can really get  your money's worth.. 
 This book reads as though it was written by the staff from the television show, "The View".  Jez... 
 "The Beast in the Jungle" is the most effective sleeping pill you are likely to find anywhere. I challenge any reader to go through this text in one sitting and not falling asleep or, at least, not to experiment a tremendous mind-numbing feeling. Of course, I haven't read all the books in the world, but I dare say that this is the most boring piece of writing ever conceived by anyone. I find it very hard to imagine something more awful than this. It's absolutely impossible, unsurpassable.  Henry James' style is so artificially conceited and pompous that you have to ask yourself if the trash he used to write wasn't a very calculated joke after all or if he's just trying to take the reader for a ride (a ride into a world of dullness and boredom, that is). The supposedly "psychological insight" of James is just a mere exercise in nothingness, the highest form of pretentiousness in its purest expression.   In this short???-story (James wasn't very strong on things like "precision" and "conciseness"), the terrible fate that seems to be in store for the main character after pages and pages of monotonous text, turns out to be that "nothing is to happen to him". Pathetic and childish. In my opinion, "The Beast in the Jungle" is the greatest proof that James was a dreadful writer (not to say "an insipid donkey").  Actually, James is so comical as to excite parody. In the old days H.G. Wells likened his prose to an hippopotamus pushing a pea and Ambrose Bierce said that James' work would benefit if someone took the pain to translate it into English. I personally agree with the two of them but, you know, many things that in the past have been judged as "ridiculous" or "stupid" are considered today, through some arbitrary process known as "reassessment of literary figures", as something pretty relevant and sophisticated. That's life, isn't it?.  "The Beast in the Jungle" is a poor story that serves James as an excuse for writing a lot and not to say anything significant. Completely worthless. In case I had to choose, I'd prefer to read a telephone directory instead.  Of course, this prime example of literary incompetence is regarded as a masterpiece by many scholars.  Well, each to his own.. 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 This band is recommneded because of New Order, unfortunately New Order is far superior.  Unlike most great bands I was not intrigued by theeir early work and it does not have a timeless sound.  I greatly enjoy The Cure, Depeche Mode and others from this same era but not Joy Division.  New Order fans skip this CD 
 I was very excited to read Dana Spiotta's 'EAT THE DOCUMENT' not only because the premise sounded great but also because of all the praise it had generated.  Unfortunately this novel did not live up to my expectations at all.  The first three fourths of the book was, in my opinion, nothing more than words on a page.  It did not set the stage for the heart of the story nor was it very interesting.  So many times I considered putting the book down never to pick it up again, however, an unfinished book nags at me therefore I was compelled to complete it.  Only the last hundred or so pages, where the focus was more on the main characters Mary Whittaker and Bobby Desoto, made the book at all redeemable.  I would have loved a lot less of the pretentious social commentary and more of an in depth look into SAFE the 70's radical group that Mary and Bobby belonged to as well as a better look into Mary's life not only for the first few years after she went underground but in present day as well.  Although this was not the fast paced thriller about two fugitives separated not only by time but irreparable actions that I thought it was, I am glad that I finished the book because if I hadn't I would have missed the best part of the story.  However, this book takes a lot of patience.  If you are not into the history of the 70's radical movement and how it relates to today, this may not be the book for you. 
 Ordered this item and it looks GREAT! Unfortuneately it did not work. Had a short in the button. Returned it and am awaiting refund.  Good customer service.  NOTE i repleaced this item through local merchants in my area and after the third one with the same problem we decided to not purchase this toy 
 This is an addendum to my review of two years ago.    First off, I mentioned that the book is written on a grade-school level.  Why not produce another edition, with the title "The Depression Workbook for Smart People" or "The Depression Workbook for the College-Educated"?  This may help some of us to feel less put off and alienated.  Additionally, the book is also written from a highly feminine point of view.  The profession expresses concern that more men are not coming forward and seeking help for depression, but I believe many men are not comfortable with many of the suggestions put forward in this book (and many others).  Men are not inclined to take up painting, or knitting, or flower arranging.  We like skeet shooting, NASCAR, and cage fighting. In other words, expecting men to become more like women in order to get well is unreaslistic.  Another suggested edition: "The Depression Workbook for Men." 
 This book was not helpful at all. I take substitute teaching and education seriously. I was looking for real activities that I could use when the teacher did not leave plans or if I had a few minutes to spare. The activities were not original or helpful.  Additionally, the pages looked like a child designed them. It was not professional. Neither was the publishing. Much of the ink was faded. 
 Frequently demonstrably wrong, and regularly claims "facts" that do not seem to occur in any other source, casting serious doubt upon their authenticity. Anyone repeating anything from this book runs a severe risk of perpetuating inaccuracies. For example, the claim in the blurb that "Twenty people literally "drowned in beer" in 1814 when a vat in a London brewery exploded" is simply not true - only eight people died, all when  buildings collapsed, and the vat never "exploded", one of the hoops broke and it collapsed 
 I wanted to like this book - I really did - but it thwarted my attempts every time.  The writing is atrocious, and not a page went by when grammar and spelling mistakes didn't mar the text.  I'd read in earlier reviews on Amazon that such problems existed, but I held out hope that revisions had been made, that the author had finally employed the services of an editor, or that it wouldn't be "that bad".  None of this was the case. The plot was not entirely terrible, but there were long stretches of boredom alternating with implausability that really made me want to stop reading.  For such a short book, it took me a long time to wade through it, as I could typically only stomach one short chapter per sitting.  The only thing that drove me to keep reading was that I was convinced that it couldn't possibly be so awful for the entire duration of the book.  (It was.)  Descriptions were uninspired and redundant, dialogue was ridiculous, characters were just characatures of figures you've already seen in bad Hollywood movies, and the plot, with few exceptions, failed to engage.  Even the setting in the facinating and enchanting Yucatan didn't help, and the author's attempts to include tidbits of Yucatan Anthropology 101 in his dialogue just came off as insipid. I'm sorry this wasn't a better book.  I decided to give it a shot as I was planning a trip to the Yucatan and wanted to believe that this would be something fun to read.   If you value good writing or a good story, don't make the mistake of thinking you'll find either here 
 Dr. Reich:  I have been reading on and off your article Testing the boundaries of Parental Authority over Education:  The Case for Homeschooling.  I even cut the corner off the book so it would be less prone to being wrinkled.    I was talking with William the mailroom guy about it -trying to explain how you get your relevance in order for you to be paid for what you do.  Clearly what you write has so little to do with the world that he and I live in, and in my life as the father and husband in a home that teaches our children your writing seems like something I would find when I run SETI@home.  Little bars going across the screen randomly.  I read your paper really as a means of escape from the reality, it is a little better than Steven King - without the bad words and ever present pharmacy scene.       I did a poor job of explaining you to Will - the reason I got into the conversation with Will about you was that I was in the mailroom using a really cool old device for cutting the corners off of documents- I was relating your political science paper to papers on chemistry or military planning.  I stated that the relevance of your work was dependent on the acceptance of the relevance of others work.   A paradigm, I guess is the right word, but it may as well be collective delusion - pretending to know something is as bad as ignorance and even more damaging.  Even the title reads like a horror story - like I am Meryle Streep in Sofie's Choice making the decision between children and losing both - Testing the boundaries of Parental Authority over Education - that sounds like something out of the twilight zone like I am living in a Fascist nightmare and you have the right to stamp my papers to let me see my children,  woooo I get shivers.     Reading your citations and the flimsy, inadequate, and un-tenable explanations of the limited data available makes me absolutely quiver with excitement.  I imagine that there is this whole other world in which you and other "researchers" live that holds untold riches in the form of grant money and Department of this and that funding and the lauding of other "authors" that uphold your delicate intelligence, the sugary latticework of interdependent conclusions that must be protected from the acetone of actuality.     One of my favourite lines is "Given the triad of interest-holders and the significance of their respective interests..." p24  this reads like a EULA for and online banking program or computer translation of Japanese pornography.     I realize that the important-sounding necessarily equals importance of an idea in the world from which you write so it has to be like that, but still, you come off like Stone's Alexander  a parody of epic - you define the meta-subtext, the clearly jumbled code that you slosh is meant to cover your exposed backside - "How should the balance of educational authority be struck?"p25.  You are here demonstrating in a rather McCarthy like way your very Un-American and masturbatory intellectual elitism.  Un-American because by our nature in all the documents and rights we have the right to individual freedom from government tyranny is the first, masturbatory in that you are clearly massaging a question which only you seem to grasp, by intellectual elitism you are posing a question that is useless, you ask it only to hear yourself then expound for a few more pages that if you replaced the word "Child" with "Car" you would never by that automobile from any dealer if you could help it.     In short you seek to make the family the child parent something like a software user agreement, in which the state can remove your rights when and how it feels necessary based on data that only has relevance because of other data.   I will provide the best possible education for my children and I will do it within and regardless of the context of the state.     Also I wonder if there will ever be a masters degree in homeschooling?  Nope, because there is a whole other world out there in which your profession and ideas have no relevance - no journal or tenure or educational lubricants needed.  Only test will be is my son and daughters able to take care of their families be a good soldier or engineer or mother or father,     There is no answer to your question is never to be answered because it is not to be posited, because it was answered 230 years ago when some British Authority got a rifle shoved up is ass as far as it would go.     The public education system is like the corrections system - I am glad it is there but I hope that my children are never "taken care of" by anyone who works for them.  It is my choice and right as an American to take care of my family.      Peace     Ted Sbardella 
 This book is all about extremes.  It describes lighting and materials in very simple terms and then proceeds to list the complex equations involved.  There doesn't seem to be any middle ground.  I understand that metal is shiny and that tree bark is rough and bumpy.  But going from that to the complex equations is quite a leap.  I was hoping for a book that explained objects in relation to the settings that 3d programs like 3ds Max use to create their materials...Diffuse, Specular, Glossiness, etc. etc.  I would only recommend this book to you if you can make use of the complex equations used to produce realistic lighting.  
 I read this work when it originally appeared in the Hebrew press. Grossman is a skillful writer and propagandist and the work is very artfully done. Nonetheless the work is a one- sided piece in which he makes the Palestinians far more moderate and humane in relation to the Israelis than their own media or their own terrorist actions have ever evidenced. One particular moment of the sentimentalization particularly offended me, when Grossman sees in the face of an old Palestinian the face of a grandparent of his from the Shoah. Perhaps he should have seen in the face of the descendants of survivors of the Shoah murdered by the Palestinians( Of which there are not a few in Israel) the face of his own grandparent.That might too have been sentimental but at least it would have reflected a true historical reality.  
 This video was not very interesting.  Neither Pamela Anderson nor Charlie Sheen can act their way out of a paper bag.  Although Pamela has her physical attributes to her credit, they can't carry the video.  This was my first venture into the Scary Movie set and it probably will be my last.         
 Upon my first experience with the Babysitter's club soundtrack i first interpreted it as an attempt to summarize the late oedipal complex (as outlined by freud) engendered in the psyche of most pre-pubescent feminist thinkers; i refer you to the song 'daddy's girl.'  'Hannah i locked you out' served as a comparable foil to this feminist view by accurately displaying the adolescent male point of view and as it pertains to the what most people refer to as "dating" (to use a colloquial term).  However upon closer inspection of the compositional arrangement i found the songs to be both trite and frivolous.  There failed attempt at a social realist portrait of comradary (in their so called baby-sitters club, if it can so be called) and serves only to portray a highly styalized and erotic display of repression and sexual angst is more reminiscent of the rococco style, renound for its total lack of philosophical basis.  As a result this cd, in my opinion, should not be viewed by any serious music concasseur.  Thank you 
      Ya, sure Mandela is a great person, a personification of a accumulation of moral and ethical supremeness, but lets face it, this book sucks.  I had to read this for a high school english class, and it bored me to death.  So many facts, so many potentially useless information, its as if Mandela intentionally tried to put emphasis on the less entertaining portions in his life.  Personally, I dont see how all the other commentors could stand finishing this book.  Good story...badly written 
 This movie is complete garbage. I actually like Robert Downey Jr as an actor but hated him in this movie. Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this trash 
 I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked.  And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.  If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all.  I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah 
 Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted! 
 This book was a huge dissapointment for me.  I am a stay at home Christian mother of 3.  It is the typical Christian "fluff" that so many publishers and authors are putting out.  I might as well have picked up an arts and crafts holiday book.  I am suprised that focus on the family affiliated themselves with this book 
 Dragon 9 is supposed to have Vista compatibility, via an update that you can get from Nuance. Unfortunately, the update does not work very well, especially in the area of commands. Imagine opening Outlook and giving Dragon the command for composing new mail or even checking mail, and watching it do nothing but move to another message in the inbox. Then, imagine going to the Nuance site to get support. You have to answer about a half-dozen questions and provide you key, even if you have a registered account that contains that key. Finally, you are told that support will cost you $9.95. Ten bucks to fix broken software?! It's no wonder they don't have a support forum; it would be filled with irate customers. I won't even go into the problems with getting the support person to comprehend the problem, except to say that the software did a better job of understanding me.  I've moved on to using the voice recognition in Vista which, contrary to a popular YouTube video, actually works pretty well. At least when I need help, I can get it for free 
 Unfortunately this item was not at all what I was expecting or wanted. Amazon did not have a pic, but I chekced other wesites and found the same pic on each one, none acturately represented the case.   The exterior of the front is very feminine. It has stiching that makes in appear padded into diamond shapes 
 I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being "Blind."  One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  That was not this book.  At first, I thought it was just me.  Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book.  But I found it too new age for me.  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.    Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.  But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one 
 I really wanted THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES because I thought that the story of the Mothman would be fascinating reading, a really intriguing narrative of the sightings of the tall, grayish man with wings and red eyes who could take off in flight straight up off the ground, an interesting examination of the myth and the legend. There is something to me very frightening about this type of legend, and I was eager to read the exploration of sightings around Point Pleasant, Va., in 1966 and 1967 before the Silver Bridge collapsed and nearly 40 area residents died in the tragedy. What a great tale could be told, I thought...  I am still waiting. This book is not well structured or told. It seems to be the dumping ground of every otherwordly event Keel has ever seen or heard of. There is little narrative arc here or suspense. Keel has the mistaken notion that loading the book with every bizarre occurence he's ever been told or witnessed gives him credibility, but it is actually the opposite. He and his "colleagues" saw so many UFOs and strange lights in the sky in West Virginia (and other places across the country) in the late 1960s, that one simply cannot believe that there isn't more corroboration of these sightings.   Keel does say that he doesn't believe in beings from other planets, but rather beings from a dimension outside of our own who like to make trouble for us, find things out about us, and sometimes warn us of things that are going to happen. Because of their inexperience with earth time, they often use out of date slang and drive old cars that are in mint condition and still smell new. For some unexplained reason, the "people" from this other dimension seem always to wear thick-soled shoes.   Keel as a true believer is a poor writer of a convincing book, as he often justifies a witnesses credibility by saying that they are respectable people, or some such qualifier. He anticipates, then, no need the reader might have to be convinced that thousands of sightings of UFOs and Mothman may need some evidentiary backup. This lack of the writer's disbelief and proof, the lack of any plot or arc and the muddled content of the book make this work a solid disappointment. Someone needs to let me know if the book that can be written about this ever is written 
 I returned this showerhead the day after I purchased it. The flexible arm is pathetic. I had to fiddle with the thing for 10 minutes just to get it to hold the showerhead up. Then as soon as you tap the showerhead, it falls back down. Ridiculous. Water-Pik should be ashamed of themselves. 
 As a dog lover and past owner of two dogs who will remain in my heart forever, I was disappointed.  Marley would try the patience of a saint.  Instead of being entertaining, the story struck me with sheer frustration. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
 This kit conveniently contains 20 sheets of photo paper. Unfortunately, Kodak doesn't contain an ink cartridge for them.  Fine, I thought, I'll buy a separate cartridge. Guess what? You can't! Kodak only sells cartridges bundled with paper so you will be forced to use their paper. Why do they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges? Seems pretty dirty 
 I run out of cartridges much faster with my HP using this cartridge than I used to with my old Epson.  I feel like I'm being gouged (ripped off), having to buy cardridges so often 
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 This book is packed with information -- there is no question about that! It is full of accepted, conventional wisdom. And that is why I did not like the book. When I read it I said to myself "here we go again". The introduction says "You can trust us, we are from the American Dietetic Association". But I think it is the same old junk that the FDA and the USDA and all our so-called experts have been giving us for the last 25 years while we get fatter and fatter and lose more and more of our grandparents and parents to heart disease and diabetes. Diabetes has become a problem now even for children as young as 10 years old. Why? I cannot understand why it is taking so long for the word to get out. There is a revolution going on right under our noses. In my opinion, while people like Dr. Atkins and others were on the right track, only Doctors Michael and Mary Dan Eades have put it all together and come up with a health program that really works. I've lost 55 pounds,lowered my cholesterol by 17%, my triglycerides by 66%, and my LDL by 15%. Moreover, I've rasied my HDL (the "good" cholesterol)by 13%. My blood pressure is now around 120/70. My ratio of Total Cholesterol to HDL is down from 5.0 to 3.7. (5.0 and over is associated with heart disease). I've read all of this stuff before! I've been to Weight Watchers, Nutri Systems and Jenny Craig. I've tried all kinds of diets. Trying to follow the food pyramid just doesn't work. Let's face it, we just don't have time to prepare and eat so-called "well balanced meals" (with too many carbs anyway)day in and day out. In my opinion, this book is a waste of your money and time and effort. If you want to know what really works and why buy "The Protein Power Lifeplan" by Doctors Michael and Mary Dan Eades (on this site) instead of this book. Better yet, buy them both! Try this one (or the other) for a year and then try the other for a year and then email and let me know how you did 
 I could not get into this book.  The storyline was dull and so were the characters.  Not recommended 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 Though this is a nice little book with good photo illustrations of the postures/exercises and a nice introduction to chakras, these exercises are very difficult for a beginning student. I will try them further down the fitness road, much further 
 I've heard many of the term before. Zoomburb. Big Box. Alligator. I guess that's what happens when you grow up in the house of an engineer. I figured this illustrated guide would be interesting to look at, so I picked it up. The pictures were only satisfactory, and some of the writing was above my head. I did learn lots of new terms though. However, I don't think I would recommend this unless you have some interest in land-use, urban planning, or architecture 
 This is an antiquated work. I have disposed of it. It is not worthy of being on your list. I am a former college history major and this book was a major disappointment 
 This is an interesting Seuss book. The moral that it is trying to portray is good, but the story is pretty lame and it doesn't seem to flow as nicely as most Seuss books 
 This mini-series takes advantage of the fans' interest in the love triangle.  Two different endings were shot, so that not even the actors knew who Christy would choose.  Unfortunately, this decision to keep the viewer guessing until the final scene makes Christy looks like a flake. By the time this soap opera ended, I didn't care about Christy's fate; I was feeling too sorry for both the men in her life.  Catherine Marshall's characters deserve better. Stewart Finlay McLennan is excellent as Neil; I wish he had an experienced actress playing Christy and a script worthy of his talent 
 As a senior computer engineer who has been in embedded systems programming for 5 years, I found this book very useless. If you are looking for my advice, just save your momey and find something else 
 Melody Thomas can write and she creates a vivid and interesting backdrop for her story in the first half of the novel and also a vivid and interesting heroine. I'm a sucker for Victorian colonial settings and for unusual heroines.   Brianna was an engaging heroine, young, idealistic, courageous, self-confident but vulnerable and unlike other heroines she has had a life and purpose before she meets the hero. However the brilliant photographer, socialist and suffragist who wanted to lead an independent, self-determined life once gives it all up to lead a co-dependent life with the hero and submits herself to the rules of others, Michael, his mother and the obligations of his ducal home which was a big part of my problem with this book.   The moment Brianna meets Major Michael Fallon she is lost to the world. I have never seen a heroine who loved or sacrificed more for the hero. The fact that she doesn't admit to herself that it was soul-searing love from the first moment for her doesn't make it any less real. She might be lying to herself but all her actions speak a clear language. She's caught in a whirlwind of passionate emotions heightened to desperate degrees by a reticent and emotionally detached hero who shows her affection one moment and a cold shoulder the next. She pursues him relentlessly, not deterred by Fallon's outward show of casualness and negligence. Actually she goes so far in her pursuance that I cringed at some of her antics. Brianna is clearly beyond pride or a healthy sense of self-preservation when it comes to the hero. I found Thomas has captured the essence of female obsession very well.   Major Fallon on the other hand remains an enigmatic person. I never could make him out. He seemed emotionally detached even as he gazed hotly at Brianna. His behavior didn't make sense to me because the thoughts the author attributed him with seldom matched his actions. He allegedly feels like a green lad in front of the heroine and like wax in her hands but in fact his actions are that of an extremely controlled person who domineers the whole relationship because he's not ruled by his emotions as Brianna is. He claims later to be obsessed with her but you never actually see any sign that would indicate an obsession on his part especially compared with the very real seeming obsession his wife feels for him. He thinks of his wife only in sexual terms to the point where it began to repulse me. I had the nagging feeling he mistook sexual desire with love and never really was interested in what was behind the alluring form of his wife and erotic passion she showed to him..   One the surface Michael Fallon is the possessive, protective alpha hero with the standard problematic past but there was an undercurrent of something deeper here at work which was never fleshed out. Many threads were left hanging such as the issue with Michael's youthful painting and Brianna's problems with her mother-in-law and her initial reluctance to become a mother. She's actually unhappy to become a mother and this thread is left hanging also. And what became of the cottage that Brianna wanted to reconstruct for her photo-lab and which reconstruction her mother-in-law stopped eventually? What did Michael think of her work? Was he ever interested the least bit in that part of her?   Sadly enough, while Brianna's love for Michael seemed touchingly authentic, his alleged love for her never came to life for me at all. At one part of the story while she is already married to Michael Brianna demands from her husband that he courts her because she feels that he has never done so. The author closes that thread with the mere  mentioning that Michael now courts Brianna. How he actually does this is not described at all which was most disappointing. I think Thomas should have pictured this instead of writing another superfluous sex scene where Michael exerts once more his tremendous sexual power over Brianna which successfully overruled her common sense every time (most annoying for this reader).  The ending left me quite sad for the heroine because I felt she was not happy with the life she never would have freely chosen for herself and which will be full of restrictions and obligations to subdue her once exuberant spirit. She had sacrificed everything and gained not much in return except a perpetually randy hero whose love for the heroine seemed  shallow and of course a baby every year.      
 This book could have been written by the "the N.I.C.E" from C.S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength.  This is quite simply the most cynical book I've ever read. There are no positive messages or characters. The Heart of Darkness, an exploration of evil in us all, is cheerful in comparison.  The setting is a religious (Catholic) school called Trinity. The teachers and administrators are called brothers (Jesuits?). The brothers are all either completely corrupt, complicit or psychologically weak. The main character who fights for his own road, in the end, recants. His friend, the only other marginally moral character is portrayed as both weak and unwilling to go against the group, no matter what the cost. The other characters are either portrayed as amoral (Archie) or unwilling to stand up to the promptings of their conscious.   I guess this last point is the most disturbing yo me. There are many characters who are prompted by their conscience to act against some kind of wrong, they all ultimately FAIL TO ACT ON IT.  The main message: Life is pointless and filled with selfish and hateful people. Trying to fight against this (no matter what your conscience tells you) is futile. Those who are the most self-serving and manipulative triumph in the end.  I found this book fully out of touch with reality. I have been down some dark roads in my life and in 42 years have yet to meet anyone as selfish and malevolent as Archie or Brother Leon. The sheer numbers of bad and weak-willed in one school is just absurd.     
 PROS:  Makes a quick cup of coffee. CONS: I went through two of these.  Very cheap and breaks easily.  I'm finding the specialty pods- Skinny Latte & Cappuccino, hard to come buy.  Usually the ones I find on the store shelves are expired.   If you really want a Black & Decker Home Cafe, get the newer model-  GT300 Home Café.   *Note: I also owned one of those Senseo coffee makers.  It would consistently dispense the wrong amount of water resulting in numerous overfills therefore wasting numerous coffee pods, so more expensive isn't always better 
 After reading The Crack in the cosmic egg, Magical Child a 30 years ago, I like to read these books. Holiday readin 
 When I was given this book by a guy friend, I thought, why am I getting a book from a Jackie Collins type writer? I had heard of some of Sydney Sheldon novels and most of them seem like JC or Danielle Steel like potboilers that appealed to housewives. but I gave it a chance and I finished it two days later.   The book revolves around Tracey Whitley (as referred to as TW in the rest of the review), a well to do computer programmer who is engaged to a wealthy banker. However, due to the death of her mother a series of unfortunate events leads her to jail to attempted murder. She was setup.   The book then follows her in jail and then her release and revenge to those who put her there. The last part of the book leads to her new life as a Master Thief and romance of a roguish competitor.   The writing style of Sydney Sheldon is not unlike that of a soap opera. He provides you enough twists and turns to keep you interested, but ultimately his books are like Chinese Food. You consume it and then forget it. It is not because the book is badly written, but because the characters have major flaws.   The main flow of TW is the fact that she is given a cloak of invincibility. Everything she does is perfect, there is literally no suspense later on in the book when she goes to Europe of her getting caught. Her antagonists are idiots, the mafia are clowns and the genius tracking her is lame (and of course crazy). When she lives in a world of cartoonish badguys, of course, she'll come out on top.   Another problem is believability. If anyone thinks that this plot is even remotely possible, they need to get their head examined. TW goes from being a meek, young girl to a Master Thief who easily robs the Prado Museum, the Diamond Exchange in Amsterdam, tricks mobsters and master chess players at their game in less than 2 years. Simply ridiculous.   Associated with the above problem is that Sidney Sheldon does not respect the robbery crimes. They are given like 15 pages each and there is no detail to any of them. Some of them have interesting twists (like how she tricks a emerald dealer in London), but the Prado robbery, pure fantasy.   So maybe that is what Sheldon is getting at all along. He is not a technical writer, he is all about the Female Fantasy (meek, proper woman blossoming into a strong, sophisticated Master Thief who gets the finer things in life and the bad boy-whom she converts). In that case the book works, but from a realism stance, it is a wash....Rating: C 
 Johnson lumps in "the gay lifestyle" with "alcoholism, drug addiction, sexual perversion, and any number of terrible problems that can afflict a family" (Pg 172). If you find this appalling, then avoid the book because there's a lot more of this.  If that doesn't bother you, then you might find some inspiration here. Clearly many have. If you prefer anecdotes/stories to bullet point advice on how to pick yourself up, this is the book for you.  But to be on the safe side, if you're looking for a role model in dealing with homosexuality in your family, do look beyond this author. While many believe that homosexuality can be "cured" with prayer, it is more widely held (by the medical community amongst others) that this is not a condition that can be cured any more than blue eyes or black hair. Be sure your approach doesn't do lasting damage to your child and your family.  
 A well meaning friend bought me The Grave Maurice in anticipation of my wanting a good read for a summer holiday. It was a grave mistake, not on the part of my friend, but on the part of Miss Grimes. Like one reviewer, I was tempted to lay fault on the editors, but throwing it back over the transom for a complete rewrite (or outright rejection) was probably not an option.   Not being a Martha Grimes fan coming into this read, my beak was well wetted for a good, fast paced, and satisfing read that hinted at topics interesting to me: race horses and the market. The Grave Maurice reads more like a bundle of "notes for future novels" than the final *well crafted* novel I expected. There are a few moments of close focus, but unfortunately these are rewarded with banal conversations, usually about food. What is worse, aside from the over-frequent references to Little Chefs, a debateable but established pinnacle of roadside Englishness, there is nothing quintessentially English about the dialogues and interactions. The characters are intrusive, explain themselves or their actions uninvited, and in short, reflect little reserve and even less depth of personality. For the sake of brevity, I'll forgo comment on the thick handed treatment of the market related bits. Finally, as to the story itself, by page 207 (paperback), I'm still not quite sure which crime will be the one warranting the skills of a Scotland Yard detective. Not a good sign. And not a good sign when I notice myself speed reading just to finish the book "on principle". I'm not worried at all that I'll miss something in this scatter-brained mess.   As an aside, I wouldn't hold the author's American origins at fault, as Deborah Crombie, a mystery writer with Texas origins, more than amply demonstrates authorial skill, refined attentiveness to anglophile atmosphere, and most importantly, editorial craft, in her "English mysteries". If you haven't read Miss Crombie's books, do yourself, or your vacationing friends, a grave favor and head over there instead 
 Mr. Tesla should have let someone else write his biography. Granted he was at his peak in the early 1900's, but much of the information he gives out about his life, especially his childhood years, is truly unbelievable - not in a good way 
 I like self-help books; I was tricked into buying this book because of its title.  I was angry when I realized the book was simply one-page, drawings (poorly done) with comic one-liners.  The book was offensive to me 
 I don't remember where I saw it, but I caught a reference to this book, 334 : A Novel by Thomas M. Disch.  It sounded interesting...  A futuristic look at life in this particular government-controlled housing unit.  After finishing it, all I can say is "why?"...  The book is a series of vignettes that follow a group of people who live in this government housing complex.  It's sometime around 2020 to 2025, and the stories jump back and forth over that timeframe.  The best I can do is describe this as "reality novel-reading" (as opposed to reality television), and I don't like either, I guess.  The stories were pointless, the writing attempted to be philosophical and deep (and it was totally wasted on me), and I never really got caught up in any of the characters or in what was going on.  It sort of reminded me of the movie Pulp Fiction in the way that the timeline of events was completely out of sequence with what you were seeing.  The end of the movie is the start of the movie from a different angle...  That sort of strange stuff.    Perhaps I'm just not "sophisticated" enough for this book, but in my opinion it was a waste of time and paper...  The only thing it had going for it was that it was fairly short.. 
 Ok, first things first, FALL OUT BOY IS NOT PUNK! Fall out boy is emo. Not punk. Punk Is black flag, agent orange...but NOT fall out boy! Their songs are bad, mostly about how their girlfriends wont sleep with them and they can not play their instroments at all. Listen to the bassist!  Think twice about buying this horrible CD!  Thank you for your time 
 David Rees is a really talented and funny person from what I've come to understand, so it confuses me that he'd waste his time rehashing a book he self-published years ago. This is not worth republishing. It reeks of a temp worker sitting bored at his desk -  It's not funny, and Rees is on the verge of exposing himself as a one trick pony if he doesn't put out something new soon! Never fear! I recently read a short story by david in the Politically Inspired Anthology and it was brilliant. David, what do you say you leave the clip art behind and give us something fresh like that? I'm a fan of yours and feel really ripped off by this book 
 I am a long time fan of le Carre - have read and loved all his books - until this one. I just could not summon the interest to finish it. Yes, I'm sort of curious about why this guy's wife was killed, but not curious enough to wade through all the documents and emails et cetera ad nauseum along with him to get there. I was on vacation and had nothing else to do, yet still, I could not wade through this mind-numbing book. I got about half way through - did I quit reading too soon? Did it suddenly pick up after that?  If you're new to John le Carre, start with an earlier book - seriously. Because he's a wonderful writer, really 
 The book is 50% watered down information, 50% anecdotes about the author paddling up some river or off the coast of NY or somewhere.  Seems to be more oriented towards racing or endurance than just the average person who likes to paddle around.  It doesn't have enough information for somebody just starting out, and  it has no useful information for an advanced kayaker.  Example: He says he's never tried a dry suit, but then goes on to tell you to use a two piece, but that they are probably too hot anyway...  As for roll recoveries - he more or less says nobody really does that and it's too hard to explain anyway, so he didn't bother.  If you want an excellent book, try "The Essential Sea Kayaker" instead.  I got both of them at the same time, and The Kayak Companion is probably going on the shelf never to be read again 
 These headphones can be slightly uncomfortable around the ears. Sometimes the part that loops behind the head is too bulky to sit comfortably while leaning on headrests or to fit under hoodies.  I've had these headphones for about 4 months and the sound quality is waning. i can only hear from one earpiece most of the time.  So basically, go for a higher quality, more comfortable item 
 I was certainly looking forward to reading this book.  While I haven't read any of the other books written by this author; his reputation preceeds him.  Unfortunately, I was wholly unimpressed by his approach.  I find the writing style very unnatural for mathematics.  It can be difficult to follow the long, rambling sentences with his strange turns of phrase.  While I can appreciate that this is modern writing, the style is inappropriate for the subject.  Mathematics must be presented clearly and accurately.  I left the book thinking that the author didn't understand the subject very well himself.  It's an interesting topic and therefore there is something to be gained here.  Sadly, there are much better alternatives to this one.  If you have a mathematical background the book may irritate you with it's style.  A pity though, it is a wonderfully rich and interesting subject 
 "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" is a history of that villain we all love to hate from the L. Frank Baum children's classic, The Wizard of Oz. I hate to write a completely negative review, so I'll start with something good. I finished it. Even that is not saying so much, since I rarely abandon a book in mid-read.  My most lasting impression of Wicked is that it just doesn't fit with the characters as I know them. In this book the Wizard is a corrupt tyrant; the Wicked Witch of the East is an (admittedly disliked) political leader and religious influence in Munchkinland; Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, cares more about fashion and society than true good works; and the central character, the Wicked Witch of the West, is not really wicked, nor is she technically even a witch, though she is still decidedly green. The lengthy philosophical discussions of politics, religion, animal rights, the nature of evil, and the presence or absence of souls felt empty and out of place with the colorful and imaginative Oz I love. Here, Oz seems dreary and unrecognizable. I don't dislike philosophy, but I missed the fantasy. In author Gregory Maguire's telling, life in Oz is bleak.  I had hoped this book would give me a new appreciation for why the witch (named Elphaba--a take on L. Frank Baum's initials) is the way she is. What I got instead was a mostly uninteresting character whose story went nowhere. I admire the attempt to humanize a villainess, but presenting her as a (somewhat) complex and (somewhat) sympathetic character makes her actions against Dorothy, not all of which are documented here, so much the less believable. Sometimes the villain just needs to be a villain! Confusingly, Maguire has taken too many liberties with the original The Wizard of Oz, ignoring some key scenes and reinventing others to suit his purposes.  It's nearly impossible to separate this book from its roots in the work upon which it purports to be based, but even as a stand-alone novel, it fails. Maguire hints at ideas and plot points that either never come together or are completely abandoned. The bottom line is that I love books I can't put down. This one put me to sleep. Literally. I finished it, but only because I really wanted to like it and hoped for some redeeming conclusion. It simply did not live up to the potential of its intriguing premise 
 I was disappointed upon receiving this CD.  I was expecting the one that is specifically with Tangerine Dream.  When I realized & looked that one up, it is OUTRAGEOUSLEY priced!!!  WHY???  Tangerine Dream isn't anymore popular than alot of other music, if not that popular or well known at all!!  I can get Pink Floyd CD's, Enigma, or One AD at reasonable prices...Is there any other resource I can look at to purchase the CD..Legend with Tangerine Dream??  Thanx for your time & listening..  Sherry 
 I had to read this book for school. I was tired of it after the first page. How was this story so popular back then? It's boring and unreal. C'mon! One guy lived with animans most of his life anf Gilgamesh was part god. I know a story of a real hero, Neo from The Matrix. That guy is cool and interesting. Also, he is cool to watch. Gilgamesh would never become a movie. People would fall asleep. Besides, any school book isn't fun to read 
 As an adult, I now understand the meaning of this book; but as a child I actually understood the story to mean that being ugly was bad and made you unloveable and that being pretty was important and made you loveable 
 If anyone has ever done any research into the fields of congnitive psychology or memory, you'll realize how incredibly awful this book is.   "If you are unable to remember any specific instances [of abuse] like the ones mentioned above but still have a feeling that something abusive happened to you, it probably did." Page 21. How awful is that? Completely misleading as well. Any memory such as this can be implanted into someone's mind, when they had NO actual abuse in their lives.  Furthermore, "If you think you were abused and your life shows the symptoms, then you were." Page 22. Need I say more? This is utter trash. Completely unbased by scientific findings or even common sense.  Avoid this book at all costs if you are a serious victim of child abuse. Realize that it is very easy, as humans, to recall past instances of violence, trauma, and abuse, when they actually NEVER happened.   It's sad and morally disturbing to see a book such as this in print. It's even more disturbing that people are accepting this book as a true "self-help" book. I encourage ANYONE thinking about buying this to reconsider and do a lot more research into their past before conjuring up false recall of past memories 
 Try doing something other than copying or scanning (both work quite well actually) and you are in for a terrible time.  The settings are simplistic "High print quality vs. Standard" (Oooo decisions, decisions)  Don't try to print anything with vivid colors!  You will get terrible results.  Couple that with the in package software's inability to create 8X11 photos that are centered, and you have one poor printer.  I don't know why they stopped making the IP 90.  Why mess with perfection?  Don't get me wrong, the scanner and copier and fax are great if this is what you wish to do with this device.  As far as photo printing goes, there are far better on the market for a far cheaper price 
 Wow, the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my  circulation!  It is way too tight for casual wear.  Also,  the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose, and  your hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me.    If you're not an athlete, then don't buy this skull cap.   It's meant primarily for bald football players to wear under their helmets 
 This book is offensive to at least one of the two genders, though it's hard to say which. It suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot, more or less. Whether that's more insulting to the male brain or the female body, I'm not sure, but the book portrays neither gender realistically.  I like Heinlein, and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential, but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass, and it's not even particularly good at being that.  The gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so, but Heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature. More's the pity 
  There are about 20% power thoughts in this CD/Book and rest are unpractical nonsense.  Nonsense like:  "I love every cell of my body" "Let the universe's solution come to you" "I am decisive in my decisions.  If I make a poor one, I'll just make another one."  I guess if you are completely foolish or just ignorant, this book will not help you much.  Your mother probably gave you much more and better advise than this book.  
 This book is only ok. It has many shortfalls, including the metric and food issues mentioned in other reviews. After trying this despite its shortcommings, I moved on. I would recommend the Foundation Diet. Though its not ment specifically for PCOS'ers, it has put me on tract, helped with hair issues and made me feel generaly better. I have lost some weight as well. If you do try Pcos Diet Book, be sure your measuring cups have metric 
 After close examination of this text, I conclude that from a Chinese/western medical perspective that this book is an attempt to make pseudoscience look convincing in order to support the marketing campaign of the authors. From a position of Chinese medicine and medical physiology expertise, they have failed.  Energy therapy is based largely on false assumptions about the brain. It uses a "thought field" approach as the main background theory. However, thought fields do not exist. The book explains energy as in positive or negative terms. However there are no physical similarities or correlates between normal energy and thought energy. Any physics scholar will know that energy does not work that way. There are know known physical correlates with new age notions of thought energy. The book makes feeble attempts to argue for the existence of these spurious and non recordable energy fields.  It steers clear of paranormal claims that are usually associated with energy medicine, but it is still pseudoscience  Qi is more accurately conceptualized as a philosophy, not a science, and its physical existence is not empirically supported. The book is completely unconvincing in arguing otherwise. In addition, they note that while acupuncture, a procedure used to correct the flow of chi, has been shown to provide some minor analgesic effects, its utility has not been demonstrated for treating illnesses or diseases. Chinese medicine uses a combination of treatments that work together.  The authors' proposed mechanisms of action are all spurious pseudoscience. There are simpler far more plausible reasons that may explain the few cases of success with the energy therapies techniques. These include placebo effects resulting from the mere expectation for improvement, demand characteristics, therapist enthusiasm and support, therapist-client alliance, and effort justification (i.e., the tendency to report positive changes in order to justify the effort exerted), and psychological manipulations such as distraction, suggestion, acceptance, and dissociation. These reasons are dismissed by the author, in preference for erroneous notions about meridians, thought energy, and the flow of Qi. The authors even claim that when the techniques fail it is because a negative person has "undone" them.  Considering that these techniques may potentially distract the patient's attention away from a serious illness such as cancer, and that the energy therapists in general do not cater for this eventuality, sensible consumers need to think more than twice before embarking on this pseudoscientific treatment. The book may convince you to open your mind for a while. However, please do not be so open minded that your brain falls out.  Regards Dr Le 
 I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability.  It's going back in the morning.  This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches.  I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc.    For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine 
 THERE WAS NO DOUBT I WASN'T WARNED BEFORE PURCHASING THIS, WHAT I WAS GETTING.  IT'S SARCASTIC, PARTS ARE FUNNY, BUT I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO WASTE ANY MORE OF MY TIME BY FINISHING THE BOOK. HOWEVER, HIS BOOK ABOUT THE WOLF & 3 PIGS WAS MUCH MORE CLEVER AND ENTERTAINING 
 Mike Davis, in an interview, admitted that he does not let the facts stand in the way of his arguments. City of Quartz demonstrates this tendency to the fullest. In a previous work, Davis pulled a passage out of a work of fiction and cited it as fact. He shows similar inventiveness in this work, citing studies that were never conducted, inventing interviews, and displaying a creativity with statistics that would be admirable if it weren't for the frightening fact that many who have read this work found it "incisive."   Those who applaud this work do so because it supports their politics. Those who attack it do so because it does not. I tried to remain neutral while reading, but when I read the book I found the inaccuracies to completely outweigh any points made by Davis. His purposeful and methodical deception does more harm than good to his cause.   For more information on this work, see an article at: (...) I would steer clear of Mike Davis and his blatant distortions of the truth 
 The old Dirt Devils that I used to own were awesome - they would last forever even when taking lots of abuse.  So I bought this updated one with high hopes.  What a mistake!  The biggest problem is that the agitator brush is air-powered, rather than electric or belt powered.  Consequently, the brush stops turning whenever it hits anything soft (high carpet, plush upholstery) and is even less likely to turn if the filter is clogged up from cleaning.  Time to find a new hand-vac manufacturer.. 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 Listen to this CD, then listen to anything off "Double-Wide". Notice anything new? Didn't think so.  Yes, the Unc has a good sense of tone and his rhythms evoke the roots of folk, country and R&B simultaneously, for which something must be said. That something comprise my two stars.  In fact, he'd be wonderful if he'd just stop singing.  Indeed, he gets no reward for badgering my aural nerves with "Memphis Soul Song." This annoying detritus is a lot like the movie adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel "Beloved" in that there are so many places it could, and should, end. But NO, it drags on... and on... and ON!   And please, enough with the "Sophisticated Country Boy" routine. Kid Rock tried that, had his moments, and now where is the Kid? He's making the cover of the Onion. That's not necessarily a good career move. 
 I wasn't sure what I'd get but it turns out to be basicly an overpriced noteboo 
 When Susan Faludi published BACKLASH in 1991, one of her chapters was devoted to the regressive representations of women in TV and film. There was even the hint of resignation that this was not a temporary blip, but perhaps a permanent or long term situation. Luckily and in part thanks to Faludi calling attention to the backlash, instead we saw in popular culture an explosion of images of strong women. In TV alone we have seen the emergence of such characters as Dana Scully, Xena, Buffy Summers, Aeryn Sun, Sydney Bristow, Max Guevera, Kathryn Janeway, and Veronica Mars, not to mention those Gilmore girls. Even shows not specifically centered on strong women have them as a matter of course, such as Kate Austen on LOST or Samantha Carter on STARGATE SG-1. Indeed, a chasm seems to separate our situation and Faludi's in 1991.   Given the richness of the subject, it is simply shocking how weak this collection of essays is. All anthologies are uneven, but this one contains a higher proportion of weak or simply awful essays than most. I don't have a confident explanation for why these essays are on the whole so weak, though they do share some common characteristics. Let me highlight a couple of these. I do want to add, however, that there are a couple of very good essays, in particular Renny Christopher's marvelously insightful essay on Aeryn Sun in FARSCAPE as well as the essay by the volume's editor on female action figures. But most of the essays are deeply flawed. Let me explain my problems with them.   One very obvious problem with several of the essays is that they either misread the shows that they discuss or almost intentionally misrepresent their content. For instance, one essay guilty of this is Sharon Ross's essay about female friendship in BUFFY and XENA. Most of what she says is unquestionably true about XENA and if the essay had been merely about that show would have been one of the stronger additions to the collection. But it is a terrible reading of BUFFY. She reads BUFFY as largely concerned with the kind of discussion and reevaluation of matters that she views as uniquely true of female friendship. If you read the essay without having seen the show, you would imagine that Willow was nearly the co-lead character of the show, instead of a member of an ensemble cast. In point of fact, BUFFY is most decidedly not a show about female friendship. In fact, excluding Willow, Buffy is actually more heterosocial in her relationships. In fact, Willow aside, Buffy relates more easily to men than to women. Apart from Willow, all her closest friends and confidantes are men, including Giles, Xander, Angel, and Spike. Her relations with women are almost always uneasy and conflicted, including her mother, Faith, Dawn, Cordelia, and Anya. Moreover, even including Willow there is never a point in the series where she primarily or exclusively goes to Willow for advice instead of Xander or Giles. To read BUFFY as primarily as a show about female friendship is a travesty. Ross also states that the show is at its "most effective when" it "offer[s] stories of the primary female friends resisting men's attempts to keep them apart." She then cites several shows as examples, including "I Robot, You Jane," "The 'I' in Team," and "Yoko."  These are not bad episodes, but they are far, far from the show at its most effective and none would make any reasonable list of, say, the top twenty-five or thirty episodes of the show's 144.  In other words, only by distorting BUFFY to a remarkable and untenable degree can it be made to be a show about female friendship.  There is no question that there is a strong female friendship as one of many major constituent parts of the show, but it is hardly privileged in the way that Ross states.    Another example is Sara Crosby's essay on three supposed instances of suicidal self-sacrifice among TV action heroines due to the forceful suppression of strong female heroes by structures of patriarchy:  Max at the end of Season One of DARK ANGEL, Buffy at the end of Season Five of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and Xena in her show's series finale.  I won't argue with the Xena part, because that is fairly accurate, but the characterization of Max and Buffy's deaths is utterly baffling.  First, Crosby characterizes Max's death as a suicide, which is absurd, unless being shot by one's clone, over which one maintains utterly no control and therefore no agency, counts as a suicide.  Agency and not similar DNA (and the DNA is only similar and not exact, since one of the themes of the show in Season Two--and it would have been THE theme of Season Three had it not been canceled--was Max's genetic uniqueness, which would have enabled her to save the world from annihilation) is acknowledged in every day language as determinative of suicide.  But Crosby barely hints at the radical departure from normal language use she is making.  It also isn't clear what structures of patriarchy she is talking about in DARK ANGEL.  In fact, Manticore, which is the entity that kills Max, is totalitarian, not patriarchal.  Unless one can generate a convincing essentialist definition of totalitarian as patriarchal this is not at all the same thing.  There is in fact a remarkable disregard for gender at Manticore and one of Max's more striking traits, despite being played by a very beautiful woman, is that she has never been feminized.  We could debate the fact that Jessica Alba is beautiful, but the brute fact of prime time television is that we will never, ever have an unlovely young person playing a lead role in such a show.  Similarly, in talking of Buffy's death at the end of Season Five, it is impossible to identify the structures of patriarchy.  Interestingly she never mentions the fact that the Big Bad of Season Five is a goddess except in passing.  Buffy sacrifices herself to close the hell portal to save her sister and her friends because of some supernatural rules.  Are the rules patriarchal?  If not, it is difficult to see how her death becomes gendered.  In other words, the entire essay is a colossal stretch.  The fundamental problem with these two and several other essays is that the writers do not seem to understand the different from actual society and a television series.  A TV series may reflect society in the way it is conceived, but it does not actually contain that society.  In fact, most of the TV series of the past fifteen years with strong female leads actually imagine a society that is different from the actual one.  In our real society, there truly are systems of patriarchy that repress women and attempt to relegate them in lessened roles.  But that system may not be replicated in a TV series.  In fact, there is a gender utopianism in many of these shows.  If one watches BUFFY or FARSCAPE or VERONICA MARS one will be struck by how rarely the ability of these women to take care of themselves is questioned by the males around them.  As Renny Christopher points out in her brilliant final essay of the volume on FARSCAPE (an essay that alone justifies the purchase price), FARSCAPE is a representation of a world in which patriarchy does not exist.  The Peacekeepers may be ruthless and totalitarian and authoritarian, but he makes no distinctions based on gender.  But what is true of FARSCAPE is largely true of these other shows.  The writers try to make the shows about issues that are really excluded by the show.  Now, one might argue with how realistic the shows are by excluding or minimizing patriarchal structures (they aren't realistic, but that is because they are utopian:  they are trying to show us a world that ought to be, a world in which women are allowed to be as strong as men), but you can't escape the fact that they are fictional worlds.  In BUFFY a man does not react with shock if Buffy kills a demon with her bare hands in front of a male as in "The Prom."  I haven't rewatched all of BUFFY in a year, but the only moment I can recall when someone was shocked that she could do what she did despite being female was the beginning of "The Gift," when a boy she has saved from a vampire asks her how she "did that."  "It's what I do," she replies.  "But you're just a girl."   But even here the point is that an unrealistic burden has been placed upon her, causing her to feel the weight of the world on her shoulders, leading her to answer, "That's what I keep telling myself."  But this is the exception.  Normally no one acts shocked if she clears the Bronze of vampires in "Welcome to the Hellmouth, Pt. 2" or overcomes a large gang of demons in "Anne."    I guess what I'm objecting to is an overall intellectual clumsiness in these essays.  As a grad student I read countless bad essays along the lines of the ones here and I think at least many of them are a result of the "publish or perish" mentality dominating American higher education.  And there is a push if you are in gender studies to take some of the central assumptions and apply them to a wide range of subject matter.  It is as if they strive to understand their discipline first, and then only half-heartedly study that towards which they apply it.  One example of intellectual sloppiness can be found throughout the first essay in the collection, Claudia Herbst's essay on Lara Croft.  Throughout she makes one generalization after another about the actual mental or psychological states of gamers that could only actually be validated by statistical analyses of actual gamers.  A large number of her "proofs" are actually anecdotes from postings on boards on the Internet.  A good example can be found in this passage:  Writing of Lara she says, "Men may interpret her toughness and her tiny waist as sexy.  Many women find her figure disturbing and respond negatively to the nature-defying design of her body.  Perhaps what women are responding to . . . " (p. 35).  These are incredibly loose hinges upon which to build an argument.  "Men may."  Do they are do they not?  And where is the polling data that indicates which.  "Many women find . . . "  Again, how many women, and where is the polling data.  Two very dubious suppositions, but then after constructing these straw men and women she goes on to speculate "Perhaps what women are responding to . . . "  She hasn't established any real women do so respond, let alone that women in general do.  Yet the entire essay is built up on weak links such as that.  Not all the essays are bad.  Though I question whether Sherrie Inness has done a good job as an editor, her introduction and her essay are both good.  Jeffrey Brown's essay on BARB WIRE was interesting, though he hasn't made me want to see it.  Charlene Tung's essay on LA FEMME NIKITA did, however, make me want to give that series a shot.  So also with David Greven's essay on WITCHBLADE (currently unavailable on DVD), though I am suspicious of his depiction of the lead as a lesbian hero (it doesn't quite pass the smell test, though perhaps I am wrong).  Dawn Henecken's essay on Chyna might be OK.  I just have less than no interest in either Chyna or the world of fake wrestling, so it was a tough essay for me to get through.  Marilyn Yaquinto's essay on women in gangster films was fun.  All in all, however, I cannot recommend the collection.  Apart from Renny Christopher's very fine essay, I don't think there is much that one interested in the subject can't live without 
 As a teacher and a parent of an eight year old who would like this item (and whose daughter happens to fall within the company's recommended age level) I am appalled at the lack of thought and responsibility that went into the production of the music that accompanies this product. As sickly sweet and boring (to adults) that some children's music can seem, suggestive lyrics are not appropriate or appreciated by this parent. On top of that, carcinogenic substances don't belong on items intended to  be touched by human beings, especially ones that are still developing. This is one item that will not end up under our tree 
 some of the stories were good enough in this collection, but most were too boring too catch your attention (too obvious, boring descriptions, weak plot etc.). i guess you have to be into the old charm of the english ghost story to really appreciate this. i guess i am too modern to be scared by a guy who talks to a guy who turns out to be a ghost, and that's it 
 The author tries to bring both the biography of Walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither. It is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time,  but, after reading the title and reviews, I was hoping for a detailed biography of Walsingham  or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers.  Instead, it is a general overview of Walsingham's life with references to the work that he did. There are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of Elizabeth I. If you want details and a better understanding of Walsingham the man, and his life work and actions, you will need to look elsewhere 
 When I was introduced to Goldberg at a conference a few years ago, the first words out of his mouth to me were (almost a direct quote), "See, I don't have horns and a tail." Other than my name and that I am a journalism/mass communication professor, he knew NOTHING about me, not even my politics or whether I had read his book. The man doth protest too much, me thinks. I have read his book, and there is nothing like a completely one-sided book complaining about the mass media being one-sided in the other direction. If all of the mass media companies (which includes book publishers) were one-sided in favor of liberals (other than Fox, National Review, Weekly Standard, etc.), Goldberg wouldn't have been able to get this book published, let alone advertised, reviewed, etc 
 This book has lots of beautiful pictures but hardly enough of true haciendas.  It is lacking originality and exterior/interior photos of the haciendas themselves.  Text content is "ok" but repetitive and sounds like that from other books.  Very overpriced for what it presents.  The authors mention that they are building their own "new" hacienda.  If they have such a true love for the old ones why didn't they rescue one from ruin??? Very commercial in my opinion 
 These Benchmark Atlas books are not any better then the Free Atlas you can get from your insurance companies. I bought and returned all of them for the western states.   I was hoping to get more detailed (back roads, etc) maps, also GPS coordinates etc. No in these, Not worth the cost of shipping 
 To be honest, I couldn't get through it.  It was that BAD!  The arguements in this book were so poorly thought out that the reader is left with no idea of what the hell was going on.  Buy this book only if you have money to waiste and you can't find anyone else to give it to 
 Michael Mandel's book has laid an egg, but you can only understand why if you make the mistake of picking up this book and reading it. This same gent, who "predicted" the Internet depression (after it already happened) now seeks to burden us with the believe that all these hobgoblins out there are the "enemies of growth." But his arguments are unconvincing and poorly presented, in prose that is hackneyed and academic-dull 
 This was the worst CD I have ever received.  It did not have a case at all and the CD did not even play.  I returned the CD and did not receive my money back 
 Perhaps I should forgive Thompson his tender age for the grievous philosophic error he commits as soon as he puts pen to paper, to wit, neither is functional programming new nor is Haskell its foremost exemplar. (Curiously, one Dr. Haskell was my orthodontist when I was a little boy, which rang a soft little bell deep in my cerebrum.) As far as functional programming is concerned, LISP is the way, the truth, and the light. Haskell may do more by way of notational "syntactic sugar" than LISP--with certainty, it can be hard to express yourself graphically when limited to concretely mathematically grounded notations [LISP = L(ots) of I(ncredibly) S(tupid) P(arentheses)]. Notwithstanding, I contend that the more difficult exercises that Thompson introduces--putatively as a vehicle for showcasing the brilliance of Haskell--point in quite the opposite direction. For LISP allows, nay encourages, parallel top-down/bottom-up development whereby you carefully extend the language to create, shall we say, a meta-4GL atop which to code your application, whereas Haskell will have none of this: it is a run-of-the-mill 3GL with some concepts and quirks that may be unfamiliar to the less sophisticated programmer, nor less, nor more. Nay, nay, I speedily toss Haskell into the basket that houses nearly every new language that comes down the pike: a few new tidbits perhaps; a more tersely expressed concept perchance; but nothing new to the sophisticate whose grasp of computer language (not to mention compuer languageS) extends beyond the ALGOL family (and, by extension, its somewhat more capable analogues, e.g., C, Java) and the handier "scripting" languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Perl) that attempt to marry some OO concepts into what is ultimately a procedural substrate. Kids, first learn what a computer system is; learn assembly language on six or seven processors and how it relates to their bus architecture, I/O interface (e.g., whether DMA or "programmed" [a la the R6502: an admittedly poor term]) and microinstruction decoding; study LISP, APL, FORTRAN 66, SNOBOL, and other vehicles that enable you to explore the range of man's machinewise thinking beyond simple-minded von Neumann and MIX models that calculate the contents of address 1 based upon the contents of address 2; THEN, and only then, read and comment upon a Haskell text 
 Interestingly, I look at this issue in quite a different way. GM food is tested and has been shown to be safe. I try my best to search out GM products and avoid untested organic stuff 
 Like an earlier reviewer, I still have about 80 pages to go on this book, but at this point I don't really care who done it, what they done, or why.  I'm a big fan of the Alex Delaware novels, but the usual strengths of that series are nowhere to be found in this book.    Mostly, it's too complicated both in plot and number of characters.  I'll read a couple of chapters and six new names are introduced.  By the time I pick up the book again, I've forgotten who they are talking about.  Some of it is truly gratuitous, such as foster or step-children whose names are different from their parents or guardians.  I need this one as an e-book so I could search back and find out who the heck all these people are.   If I wanted to work this hard at reading, I'd go dig out War and Peace 
 1. Watch the movie "Hustle & Flow." The handful of songs that are played all the way through sound good, especially the catchy and smooth "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" and "Hustle and Flow."  2. Get CD soundtrack to film. Discover to unpleasant surprise that virtually all of the songs on it are operating on the mental level of "Whoop That Trick." (That is to say, a very low IQ level, with endlessly repetitive choruses that aren't catchy.)  3. Realize that amongst the professional rappers on the soundtrack, the best one is professional actor Terrence Howard.  4. Smile bemusedly. Sell used CD 
 This could have been a very good documentary, but the video editing style made it unwatchable for me.  The camera never stays on any subject for more than 5 seconds, film is sped up and slowed down for no apparent reason, and bright flashes of light with loud sound effects highlight the transition from scene to scene.  The events surrounding 9/11 are fully capable of engaging my attention without this in-your-face style of presentation, which ironically dilutes the overall impact of the film 
 This book does have some nice pictures, but I don't like the way some of the animals are named, for example calf instead of cow, kitten instead of cat....  I think very young children find it easier to say  cat, cow instead of kitten and calf.  There were too many of these types of identifiying names.  I'd stick with a book that has the basic names and work from there as my child gets older 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 The Junie B. Jones series represents thoughtful storytelling replete with the sorts of syntactic and semantic errors that all thoughtful parents try to stamp out of their children's discourse conventions. For example, my multilingual daughter, a second grader in an international school in Japan, incessantly mixes Korean, Japanese and English grammars and meanings, not to mention reproducing the very colloquial forms of casual spoken English I'm always encouraging her to readjust in agreement with more standardized forms.  The typical difficulties that young native speakers of English have in moving, say, from the comparative to the superlative or in adjusting tense forms in regular and irregular verbs are codified throughout this series. Those who might object to this critique would also have to defend why errors such as those referenced here occur not only in the dialogues among the characters, but also in the expository portions of the stories. The author makes no effort to encourage her young readers to see the differences between colloquial forms and the more widely accepted standardized forms.  Thanks to Ms. Park's efforts, young children honing their language skills now have an opportunity to model the varieties that society generally deplores. Though her stories are delightfully cute, her methods do not further the kinds of knowledge that the larger society will come to expect from informed citizens. If her editor hasn't yet been dismissed, I would encourage Ms. Park to reflect a bit more on her approach to educational texts. 
 Did you hear about when Amazon accidentally uncovered the identities of some of the reviewers and it was discovered that a lot of Authors were giving their own books numerous 5 stars reviews?This book in my opinion is a classical example of that,the book has no structure,no organisation.The author blows his trumpet a lot about his farcical NFL career (who cares).It is truly an awful book on options and I would be willing to give my copy away for free.I would give it 0 stars if Amazon would have given me that option,buyer beware 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 This book was an anthology of 19 stories. I didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. I had to read almost every paragraph over. I could not comprehend at all 
 Isn't this illegal or something?  To write a mystery (or anything for that matter) that simply has no ending? I don't think I've ever encountered anything quite like this before!  It's not that it's left up to the reader's imagination or anything like that.  The book just ends! No resolution of any kind.  Like there were pages torn out! Even if a story is to be continued in the next book of a series, fine but there has to be some explanation for the characters' actions and some kind of ending in order for the reader to be encouraged to come back for the rest of the story.  I actually quite enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book and assumed, stupidly I guess, that the author would pretty much tie things up so it was such a disappointment and actually downright insulting to find that the author simply doesn't care in the least about her readers. At the very least, the author and the reader have a silent understanding that the reader will be willing to excuse some errors or idiosyncratic writing or loose ends so long as the author provides the reader with a work that is sincere, entertaining and professional. I did my part. I paid my 10 bucks for the book, I read it until the very end and then the author let me down.  Not just because I didn't like the ending.  But because the author showed such disrespect for me, the reader, that she didn't even bother with an ending! I will never read another of Ms. Grimes books ever again.  What a cheat 
 else....a curse of havning the Kennedys in our government.  It seems that all the wild living, party girls, drinking and stupid actions lead to their troubles....NOT a curse on them.  This book is a piece of fluff!  Don't waste your time 
 This is the most pointless show ever. Seeing baby's fart and dogs biting crotches and people degrading themselves by making themselves look like complete dumbasses is funny? Have the brains of America been THIS simplified? This is a show that belongs on MTV- it has all of the traits an MTV show has: it's pointless, it's pointless, umm... It's pointless... And, well, it's pointless! If you wan t a show with humor (not to steal anything from Danny), watch the Simpson- the funniest show ever along with Family Guy. Why would anyone want to watch a show about people acting like complete idiots? MTV Rocks, maybe. 
 i have read several of this author's works and found them to be good reads.  emma's secret, however, is just a big yawn and reminds me very much of danielle steele {the author who writes a short story but makes it last for about 300 pages by adding a chorus that repeats incessantly}. nothing happens except for the fashion retrospective. it has taken me 4 weeks to struggle through this book and i'm still not quite finished even though i've started skimming some parts.  i guess you can tell i'm finished with barbara taylor bradford. can't wait to start ken follett's new book 
 Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, "Talk of Angels" could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest 
 I wrote a review of this book more than seven years ago, the one dated September 7, 1999: "The trouble with this book is that it has the wrong author...Professor Dawkins, when may we expect the book that needs to be written on this subject?"  Hooray!  We finally have it.  Buy "The God Delusion," by Richard Dawkins instead of this book 
 I ordered the HarperCollins Sansoni Italian Unabridged Dictionary, Second Edition, on the carefully evaluated basis of it's description on Amazon, plus positive reviews from friends.  What I actually received from Amazon was the Grande Rizzoli Larousse English Italian Dictionary. I made one attempt to reorder the HarperCollins Sansoni, but again received the Rizzoli Larousse, at which point I gave up. Perhaps Amazon could let me know when they find it? I understand it is a good book 
 I was really excited about this toy because it was a stacking and sorting toy in one. And I love Laugh and Learn toys. I got it for my daughter for christmas when she was 16 months old. She never liked it. I kept it out and encouraged her to play with it, but she just really didn't get into it. Also, there is a sticker that goes on the bottom of the top pot so you can see the shapes through the holes on the lid, and the sticker shapes don't match the holes! Unfortunately, this toy was a big let down. 
 The authors attempted to show how scholarly they are by using very hard to understand language.  I would have appreciated language that was easier to understand to help me deduce their perspectiv 
 I thought this was a good slicer until I tried to slice a block of Extra Sharp Cheddar and the wire snapped about halfway through the 3rd slice. No way to replace the wire so the whole unit is now useless. If OXO stands by their warranty, I might try to get a new one, but until then I am going to use a cheaper adjustable one 
 for those who have not a clue about any area of prefabricated housing types and techniques, this would be an ok choice.  for the rest of us, however, it is full of too much "fluff" and unsubstantiated opinion to be of much use.  his use of the title "manufactured" houses, which is a term that is only (in the most strict "correct" sense) to be used to describe mobile homes constructed after related legislation of the 1980s, displays the first example of this ignorance.  he also does not cite any references, despite using figures in the text that should require that approach.  a lot of the information is also now out of date. use it as a starting point, but not much more.  i would suggest you read allan wallis' "wheel estate" for information on manufactured house form and history, and colin davies' "the prefabricated home" for much of the other prefabricated home types instead.  neither of those can provide a full knowledge of the subject matter in and of themselves, but currently they provide the best sources for beginning a study of prefabricated home types 
 It looks like a magazine rather than a book. Only few projects are nice but it's not worth it to pay $21 for those projects. The instructions aren't that clear and neither the graphs, I would not recommend it to anybody since there are much better books out there (e.g. The beaded garden - Diane Fitzgerald). I have seen many Russian books on beadings and there are much more interesting and worth to be translated.   
 I read "The Big Sleep" expecting a detective novel which would keep me up at night turning the pages, finishing it in one or two sittings.  It lasted a month.  The plot isn't all that exciting, and frankly hard to follow.  There is little to no character development.  I certainly felt the cigarette filled rooms smelling of booze and rumpled detectives, but the storyline was uneventful.  I will rent the DVD to see what Hollywood made of the book.  Certainly, there must be other intriguing works of detective fiction, perhaps even by Chandler, that would be better than "The Big Sleep." 
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 A very god movie as far as content, but terrible picture quality as far as it being high def. I would have to say don't waste your $$ on the HD-DVD version and just by the regular DVD, they both have the same picture quality. 
 I've never taken an economics class in my life.  I'd always heard that economists spoke a different language than everyone else, and in some instances, lived on a different planet than everyone else.  After reading the very enjoyable "Freakonomics," I decided I might be wrong, because if "Freakonomics" was an example of what Economics is all about, then it was fascinating.  So I went in search of a book on Economics that would also be accessible to the layman, and came across "Hidden Order," which only reinforced my earlier stereotypes.  Despite a great opening chpater or two, I put the book down after 5 chapters, as each one became more incomprehensible than the last.  I have no doubt there is some very good information in this book.  Unfortunately, it's written in a mixture of English and "Economics-ese" -- just when you think you're close to understanding what Friedman is trying to get across, he throws in a chart and some terminology that makes everything incoherent.  On top of this, many of the examples and explanations he uses make absolutely no sense...at least no sense to anyone who lives in the real world.   Perhaps this book would be useful to someone who has taken an Econ class or two, but if you haven't, you'll simply find this book frustrating.  Thank goodness I checked it out of library and didn't have to pay for it 
 I had to read this book for my college history course in World History.  The book gave good factual events from an American who had gone to Russia during the five year plan in Stalin's regime.  This book is an autobiographical account of an American man's life and marriage in Russia, yet I did not enjoy the deep amount of factual literature that was implemented into the book, since the author did not let the reader become intimate with his personal life or feelings.  I felt that this book was more of a textbook than a novel.  However, I believe that professors will most likely assign this book for their students, especially for the topic of the five year plan, due to the amount of historical and factual content embedded into the story 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 Since I listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as Tony Roberts performance was so bad, it was impossible to follow the story line.  He read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did.  In addition to the slooooow reading, his characterization were completely over the top.  Dino sounded like a moron and "Billy Bob" well like a Texas moron.  And what about Billy Bob, that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story.  Skip this this one or prepare to suffer 
 Please read this before ordering:  This is yet another compilation album featuring previously released tracks by Mannheim Steamroller.  If you're new to the band, this isn't a problem, and it might in fact be a good way to be introduced to their non-Christmas music.  For the rest of you... you can compile most it yourself and save some money.  Here's the track listing:  1. Love is Blue 2. Time For Us 3. Circle of Love (from "Fresh Aire 8") 4. Sunday Morning Coffee (from "Sunday Morning Coffee") 5. Pine of Rome 2nd. Movement (from "Yellowstone") 6. Sonata (from "Fresh Aire I") 7. Yam Seng (from "Romance") 8. Mozart Piano C. 2nd. Movement 9. Teddies and Hearts (from "Impressions") 10. Rainbows (from "Fresh Aire 7") 11. Velvet Tear (from "Fresh Aire 2") 12. Cavatina  Chip Davis has apparently retired, as he only releases compilation albums these days, featuring just a couple of new tracks each time to ensure somebody buys them.  Financially, I'm sure it's working out great for him, but it's a shame that a good musician has resorted to doing this.

   As was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for.  They gave us Advent Children, cell phone games, and finally Dirge of Cerberus.  This game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under-used and least interesting character in the Final Fantasy Series.  Its the creators way of telling us that they will never re-make Final Fantasy VII but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man 
 If the author was not a Stanford University lecturer, I would surely think he is a leader of some obscure eastern religious sect. And like most such leaders, the author is great at saying things without substance, but somehow makes it sound substantial.  For example, in the paragraph that starts with "what is the highest goal?", I have noticed that the author never directly answers this question. Instead, he wavers with few meaningless dialogue such as "philosophical traditions tell us that we have within us amazing potentiality, including that of the whole universe...power of many nuclear reactions is present in  even a cubic cenitmeter of empty space..The highest goal is simply to be in this experience of connection or truth all the time." That sounds awfully like what some bald headed Krishna dude try to sell me during my college years.  To be sure, I felt the book does try to enlighten your spirit. Certain passages does open your eyes to new possibilities towards spiritual enlightment. If you are into such stuff, I suppose it is best to get it from a famous Stanford Lecturer\Yogi 
 I haven't read this book.  I won't read this book. I don't need to read this book.  Here someone has the audacity to compare the Harry Potter books with Tolkien's huge achievement; anyone who would think there is anything worth comparing is dull-witted.  This has been written to make $. Ignore it, good people 
 If you want to waste your money on a useless product, then buy shedender. The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside.  As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do. The next day, I wired out just as much as I would have if I didn't use shedender. The bottom line, your pets shed from their top coat, not the bottom coat; so you're wasting your time and money with this product

 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 this is, i am sure, a perfectly helpful book across the pond.  in america, especally the upper midwest not so much.  the measurements are off and the ingredients are not readily available fresh or frozen.  very few recipes i can use. some interesting ideas tho. 
 It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the full season box sets much sooner 
 This book just proves that religion is something the world does not need. You can get the same effect of this book by reading a Dungeons and Dragons rule guide or listening to a Helloween song.  Avoid 
 Pinsky has alighted on the translation solution that will eventually give rise to the definitive English Dante.  Rather than forgo ryme altogether or force his English into perfect terza-rima, Pinsky employs slant rhyme.  Pinsky calls his version Yeatsean, but of course other poets have embraced slant rhyme to great effect--Dickinson stands out for me.    But reading Pinsky's "Translator's Note" prepares you for the failings of his translation.  For he has also aimed for a more compressed version, one with more enjambment, to convey something of Dante's own compression and, I suppose, swiftness.  The problem arises in the very first tercet, where Dante spends three full lines on waking up lost in that dark wood.  Pinsky dispenses with those lines in 18 syllables, then interrupts Dante's startling recollection at the end of the second line to rush the next tercet into the first one.  The enjambent conceals the slant rhyme, mooting Pinsky's otherwise brilliant poetic solution, and also shucks the essential weight of Dante's opening.  It reads like a prose translation, embarrased by even its own of-rhymes (which are actually a great idea!) and blasting through Dante's thought without recognizing Dante's own choices about end-stopping his thoughts more frequently.  Unless English is 20 percent more efficient than Italian, or translators care for sense at the exclusion of the original's poetics, this book disappoints.    And it's a swift, compressed opening even at three full lines.  Three lines--just three--for Dante to depict himself as spiritually waylaid:  further compression simply detracts, and it dishonors the poem's already admirable economy, not just its efficiency but also how it chooses to spend each tercet, the careful filing of each one with this step or that in his journey, or to run over into the next tercet.    Pinsky's is a bilingual translation, allowing you to just visually register how much more ready he is than Dante to break Dante's thoughts before the end of a line and start Dante's next phrase or sentence with two or three or four syllables left.  All that enjambment is perfectly natural to English poetry, maybe even to Italian, but the facing-page presentation of Dante's actual words reveal that Dante employed rhyme togeth with the regular ryhthm of the line-endings to generally honor his rhetoric.    That compression, by the way, makes most of the cantos radically shorter than Dante's own verse.  Canto after canto is 20 to 30 lines short of Dante's Italian, and when a Canto is maybe 120 or 130 lines long, the translation becomes more like a discount version of Dante than an English Dante.  Allen Mandelbaum, who translates into blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter), offers the poem the dignity Dante's Italian merits.  You can use the facing page Italian to see that.  Dope out what those latinate words obviously mean, and see how much reordering and reduction Pinsky offers--here turning a descriptive phrase into a single adjective, there shrinking a long appositive or subordinate clause.  Pinsky's diction is more fluent, more readily grasped than other translations, but it often feels off-hand, hasty, artless, undramatic--a tour of Hell in cargo pants.  The story still conveys its tone, but mostly through incident, not via Pinsky's poetry 
 So I am a big fan of Sojourners and Jim Wallis and his "crew." I heard that McLaren was a part of Sojourners and the title of this book looked intriguing, so I gave it a try.  This was the first time I have ever started a book and then intentionally did not finish it. I read about 150 of the 200 pages and went to a used bookstore.  Problems: 1. With a title like "Secret Message of Jesus" you expect McLaren to be suggesting something new, something different, something controversial, or unpopular. But basically what he teaches is what I have heard for years about Christianity. Nothing new. 2. Because he says in his introduction that he is writing for both curious new-comer to Christianity and scholar, he tries to keep it basic. Problem is, he keeps it TOO basic. He feels the need to go in depth about the state of Israel for pages, who the Pharisees were, who the Sadducees were, retell the story of Old Testament history, etc. I just kept waiting for him to get to the point instead of dragging his feet in redundancy. 3. The phrase "Secret Message" is used SOOO MUCH, it just gets annoying. Its almost like McLaren is talking about a club he started as a kid and you got to know the "Secret Message."   4. Poor writing quality and nothing really spiritually in-depth.  Don't buy this book 
 Amazon shipped the wrong size notebook. No problem... returned the product.  Amazon is a great merchant...will buy from them again. 
 this author is shallow and is not precise. this work is a failure 
 I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.   The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.   It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.   I know that "technology as magic" and "religion = magic" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.   Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.   IOW, religion is subject to criticism ("it's not measurable") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.   If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.   The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.  Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this "religious cover for nuclear technology" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it. 
 Ms. Landis's story is interesting and sad, human and not very unusual --yet she seems to have been a special person. However, this book is so badly written and awkwardly put together that it's hard to do much more than quickly skim through it only to get the facts 
 The continually referenced web site says, "Coming Soon." This book may be ok for a full time help author but is very time consuming to find information. CSS, DHTML and HTML Help information is scattered all over the book. The index is of little help. I'm sure someone could build HTML Help if they had years to do it as did the projects the author references. The supposed on-line files might help. I feel very ripped off that the author did not follow through on the website and example files 
 Just note how many reviewers who liked this book use ad hominyms to attack alleged victims and their caretakers.  Also note the repeated references to "False Memory Syndrome", which is not recognised by the APA or any other psychological or medical instituion with a peer-reviewed journal. Is memory fluid? Of course it is. But so-called False Memory Syndrome is simply an invention of perpetrators looking for absolution, and of misguided (even if well intended) researchers who would rather believe it is all delusion rather than face the fact that "well-respected" community members and authority figures are just as likely to abuse a child as anyone else is. Note the completely irrevelvant testimony about his "character". Who cares if he was a Sheriff? Or a "deeply religious man"? Rapists and molesters come from all cultural and socio-economic backgrouds. Yes, cops (even "deeply religious" ones) do sometimes commit extreme acts of selfishness and cruelty, often within their own families. Accept it, people: there is no "type" of person who rapes or molests.  This whole thing reeks of apologetic for a confessed child molester.  Don't swallow it 
 I don't share the same enthusiasm as other reviewers... This is an absolutly boring movie and be warned nearly 60% of the movie is shooting in night time.So you are in the black .A lot of fun garanteed...!!!! Zero action and zero everything. The HD DVD transfer is surely not what you expect from High definition 
 This book has spelling errors, coding errors, screenshots don't match the code, example code does not compile, etc.   Stay away from this book!! 
 Much smaller than it appears. Does not hold 20oz. I gave it away for christmas, instead wishing for one of those old 32oz Aladdin coffee mugs they used to sell or give away at 7-11. I have one old one. It keeps my water cold, and I do not have to fill it often 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 this toy isn't what i wanted because it doesn't work as a tent it leaves small room for playing in. i don't really reccommend it 
 Yes, she has a lot going on and yes her husband buried himself in work and yes her neighbor is attractive...but there is ABSOLUTELY no justification for having a fling.  She is a weak and pathetic wife.  Why wouldn't she simply talk to her husband and say "Honey, I am feeling really lonely because of how much you are working.  I love you and I miss your company, and I'm starting to feel distant?"  That is what any normal, mature adult would do.    An artice of Cathi's that I just read in Tango about dating proves that she is an immature adult, stuck in the 10th grade.  She actually advised a girl who has been dating the same guy for 10 years and who is still crazy about that guy to try and "see other people" before they get married so she won't regret anything.   Morons like Cathi Hanauer make having a normal, stable, loving relationship and drama-free dating experience IMPOSSIBLE.  SHe needs to die. 
 Absolutely horrible ending to this series which wasn't very good to begin with.    There was a time when RAS used to be one of the most enthralling writers in the Fantasy genre.  Now he's become stale, he rehashes old plots, and all of the main characters are invincible.  One can only hope that RAS can revert back to his older style.  And let's hope that happens sometime soon 
 Well, I am really glad I borrowed this book instead of buying it because I saved myself the 10 bucks.  There's nothing new in this book.  At least he doesn't go on and on about his political agenda like he did in the last book but in this one all he does is tell you to feed big pieces of bone and doesn't talk at all about WHAT you're feeding - as in the quality of food.  Don't you think it's important to talk about that?  I mean, is it natural and okay to feed your dogs hormone and antibiotic laden food for its entire life?  Give me a break.  I would would have expected more from someone who supposedly knew so much.  Bottom line: don't waste your money 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 Basically this book was the author's dissertation. And that's about it. The writing isn't that good, and the "study" as a whole is very limited. In particular she ignores the previous punk generation, and doesn't address the changes in the scene over 20 years. This ignores the fact that as punk became more common, the common problems of the general culture seeped back in  - especially sexism. It could be used as a starting point for young people to enter the discussion, but certainly can't be seen as any kind of definitive text because there are too many holes. I was disappointed because I was so looking forward to someone finally opening up this topic, and had expected something better 
 A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was. The same story told second time is just boring. The first one had a backbone: boys trying to achieve the goal despite the circumstances. The second one - ranomly selected stories about this or that - I simply don't care. Meaningless and borin 
 Forget using this in a shed as the light is hardly bright enough to see your hand in front of your face.    It doesn't hold a charge for longer than a few hours (the unit I received stayed on for about one hour and the box stated three hours).  This information was no where to be found on the website.  I purchased this item to use in my chicken coop and had anticipated that I would be able to leave it turned on at all times.  My plan was that it would recharge during the day and stay illuminated during the night.  Not possible with this unit as it can't charge the battery at all if it's left turned on.  In addition the unit I received had been previously used and returned by someone else (obvious from the packaging that it had been used before)... so I'm not the only one who thought this was worthless.  Save your money and try a different product 
 While I was reading this book I felt like I was reading  journal. Essentialy it was a journal with a little plot to beef up and pad the book. This was hard to read because it had very few exciting points. I only finished this because I had to read it for a class. 
 I'm always looking for ways to make coding work better, at any level from nanosecond arithmetic operations to decade-long enterprise operations. I didn't find much of use here, but there were a few good points here (very few). Let me start with those.  The "Execute Around Method" pattern is good idea, applicable far beyond this Smalltalk context. The Beta language has "inner" inheritance, which makes the idea easy, but most other languages lack a good mechanism for undefined logic between matched operation pairs (open/close, setup/cleanup, etc.) "Enumeration" is another good one, enshrined as "Visitor" in the Gang of Four book.  Most of what's left is either trivial or Smalltalk-specific and face it, Smalltalk is mostly a cult language with nearly no commercial significance. The Smalltalk pretty-printing and variable-naming rules, fatuous at best, are just not applicable to most langages. Some of Beck's "practices" are language features (like 'super'). Other "practices", like the long chapter on Collections, seem to describe standard library classes and messages. Yet others (e.g. Type Suggesting Parameter Name) correct language defects - Smalltalk chose to give up the error detection capability offered by variable typing. Beck tries to sneak it back in with variable naming conventions sort of like Microsoft's old Hungarian naming. Some of his suggestions are just dangerous, like that one that says a constructor should "half-way construct an object in one place, then pass it off to another to finish construction. (p.23)" This distributes an object's setup responsibility across its client classes, leaves unusable and incomplete objects floating around, and causes subtle exposures in multithreaded systems - I'd rip out any code I saw built this way.   The good news is that no new trees died to make my copy of this book - I got it used, and it's returning to the used market. At least my conscience is clean on that account, no matter what I'm doing to the poor guy who buys this book next.  //wiredweir 
 In theory, this is an excellent Cher compilation. The cover is lovely (and the first from Universal's 'Gold' series to deviate from their uniform aesthetic) and the tracklisting is a satisfactory overview of Cher's career. It certainly tops the domestic release of 'The Very Best of Cher' which was a skin-and-bones effort intended to offer the essential Cher songs and little else. Australia, Canada and parts of Europe, however, ended up with a far more interesting 2CD package. With a CD-busting length of 42 tracks, this deluxe release of 'The Very Best of Cher' leaves 'Gold' for dead. Although the two vary slightly on the earlier inclusions (you won't find Cher's brash reading of 'Alfie' on 'The Very Best of Cher', nor the iconic 'You Better Sit Down Kids' and 'Living In A House Divided) every song on 'Gold' appears on 'The Very Best of Cher' along with a healthy smattering of oft-forgotten cuts. Neither compilation addresses Cher's Warner albums from the mid-seventies, a shame considering 'Stars' and 'I'd Rather Believe In You' contain some of her best ever recordings, but at least 'The Very Best of Cher' makes more of an attempt to bridge the gap. 'Rudy' from 1982's 'I Paralyze' is a welcome inclusion, as is her otherwise unavailable on a Cher album disco cut 'Bad Love'. The Meat Loaf duet 'Dead Ringer For Love', a staple of Cher's hilarious/fabulous eighties schlock rock period, is also included, as is a cut from Cher's 1994 'not.com.mercial' CD which was sold exclusively through her website a few years back. There are also five songs from Cher's latest studio release 'Living Proof' which might seem slightly excessive, but the songs are frighteningly fun so the decision is justified.  Although the un-chronological sequencing on 'The Very Best of Cher' is rather frustrating - in that respect, 'Gold' is a more effective compilation - on content alone there is no contest. For the casual fan, the 2CD 'The Very Best of Cher' will be the only Cher album they ever need to own. For hardcores, it remains the most satisfying compilation and even offers a couple of rarities that make it a worthy purchase. Had Universal included a couple of unavailable tracks from Cher's mid-seventies period it would have scored extra brownie points, but as it stands 'Gold' is a fairly redundant release for the Cher connossieur and casual fans alike. The 2CD import version of 'The Very Best of Cher' is available here at Amazon. It may be twice the price but it is a far better investment 
 Fictional tale of a farked up childhood in care. Has a gushing jacket quote from JT Leroy so if you like his/her writing then you will probably enjoy this. Was terribly slow to get going and I stopped caring after 30 pages.  
 This was the most disgusting diet product I've tried.  I love marshmallow dip, and this wasn't even close to tasting like it.  It has a chemical taste, like you're eating spun plastic, and makes you actually scared to eat it.  Why even bother eating it.  I'll stick with fat free whipped topping -- at least it has flavor 
 The book is comprehensive. Very seldom you try to look up a picture or video which is not in the book. The reviews are sometimes too short, however, the book would be too unhandy if every picture had a bigger review. Also the facts about the different movies are accurate and helpful 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 This version, however artistic and well performed, has very little tie to the original Nutcracker!  Some highlights:  -  No nutcracker, it is a boy doll  -  An older and mature Clara  -  Eastern bloc inspired costumes (see below) -  A pistol instead of sword fights (including on feigned execution of one of the orphans) -  Non-traditional ballet -  Traditional Score by the Royal Philharmonic (the good part)  The scenery is intentionally dank and grim for most of the production, taking place at a dismal (and clearly abusive) orphanage complete with eastern bloc inspired costumes and sexually suggestive behavior.  Of particular note is the giant sparkly mouth (yes, you read it right), blessing the stage during two scenes which characters show reverence to by sticking their fingers in their mouth (at least one takes to licking the mouth itself.  Odd, at best).  In sum, this production was not suitable for our four year old aspiring Clara, who was expecting (as were we) bright costumes and sugar plum fairies.  The productions claim that is "a delightful feast for all of the family" is, in this writer's opinion, a far stretch.  Bourne's Nutcracker, in a nutshell:  Les Miserables meets La Cage aux Folles 
 If any kid music annoys you, this CD is NOT for you.  These are good old classic songs, but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs.  I'm throwing it away.  I want my two-year-old to know the songs I know and love, but this was a bad buy on my part.  
     I suscribed to this magazine since I got a great offer on it from the company I get my other suscriptions from so I decided, why not??    Its been a year and, although the previews of each week's prime-time programs are fun (2 pages worth) I was very dissapointed. The articles are empty, boring and some downright retarded; rehashing show's dialogues, requoteing newscomments - its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around.    I realize this is an entertainment magazine, but still, the articles in People magazine seem like rocket science in comparison - gasp!!!    Do yourself a favor and just buy a TV guide - MUCH more interestin 
 Boring book, the guy truly rambles; was disappointed especially after I found a good article about Jefferson in wikipedia. What added salt to injury is that I discovered that Hichens was (still is?) a Stalinist - felt that Jefferson might not have liked it had he been alive, i.e. to see a Stalinist as his biographer. Life isnt fair, as daddy says. Finally, I came across a video in which he was debating a British guy, I think his name was George something, he starts combing his hair in the middle of the debate - then he was called Popinjay; couldnt hold my stomach with laughter.. 
 Okay, so the purported author is a rambling old woman in her 70s, but that doesn't mean you will want to bear with this meandering narrative. There isn't much to pull you through--smashing idols with feet of clay? Yawn. Gore Vidal is so much more satisfyingly acidic. Concern for any of the characters? Not much. Fanny T. escapes what little peril she's in during one short chapter. White's descriptions of the characters who populate are marvelous but it's not worth the long sludgy haul to get to them. I'm fond of some of White's other work and thus am disappointed in this one 
 "This book aims to put killing back into military history."  no kidding!  that's like saying "I'm going to put the 'ball' back in 'football'!"  that line had me suspicious... other lines clearly suggest that the author is bringing more than a little of her own "gender" war into the scenario as well.  she makes no effort to be "objective" and easily and gleefully casts judgement on virtually every subject she bothers to discuss.  the following quote is revealing:  "Historians have been rightly cautious about passing judgement on people in the past, but this must be done if we are to grant servicemen and -women in the past an active, creative role in the making of their own histories"  my first reaction was "what the hell?"  so, by self-righteously passing judgement on people in the past (imagining ourselves to be better in the process) we're helping THEM play an active role in "making" their own histories?  that sentence alone proved the author's TRUE motives were not in producing a serious academic or scholarly work on the nature of warfare and killing.  since part of her focus is how the culture deals with warfare and killing--she feels at liberty to quote movie directors, military historians, novels, and soldiers with equal credibility!  Dave Grossman's book "On Killing" is more concise, more carefully documented, and better written.  her bibliographic references ARE impressive.  and yet she only scratches the surface on some issues.  particularly regarding fighter pilots (which is my area of pseudo-expertise).  the joy they took in "killing" was often merely a "sporting attitude" they had.  dehumanizing their "kills" or "victories" helped them do the job.  very few fighter pilots actively took joy in killing their victims.  again, Grossman does a better job of exploring this issue 
 I read the stock reviews and then the readers' reviews and could not agree more with Mr. Hauer's reaction.  I cannot understand how anyone who reads very much could tolerate this poorly written book.  Undoubtedly, Mr. Thomson is a font of knowledge on film history, but he needs a writing class badly.  I threw the book down at p. 181.  Try this on for size:  "No doubt, esteemed Renaissance painters and eighteenth century composers were able to carry on their work without distraction.  (All they had to worry about was Inquisition, plague, or sheer loss of favor.)"  The book is full of bizarre, inaccurate rumblings like this - - and that's before you figure out what in the world this weird aside has to do with the history of American film.  A good editor would have advised the author to reduce his dependence on convoluted sentence structure, entertain simple declarative sentences and reduce this mess to a meaty magazine article at best 
 The hot pot worked great--I could use it at my desk at work to heat up water for a cup of tea super-fast (under 2 minutes).  However, the heating element died after just a few months!  I am really upset--I hate heating up water in the microwave, but I love my cup of tea.  I am searching for a similar item, but one better made than the Rival hot pot 
 I can't take it.  I absolutely loved the earlier Kay Scarpetta novels, but this one? Um, no.  First, the writing style is completely different from the earlier novels, it's like someone else wrote it using Patricia's name.  It seemed very disconnected, nothing more than a whole bunch of ideas taken from fan-fic works.  In places, the book was very hard to follow and there were a lot of places where I looked up and said to no one in particular "what was the point of that?"  Second, Benton.  Give me a break, it was like reading a bad sci-fi novel, although it did give some meaning to a phrase from one of the earlier novels, Black Notice I think, when Marino made a remark about what Kay would think if Benton wasn't really dead.  I actually spent an hour scouring through the earlier novels just to find that line.  Third, what kind of friends would allow someone to grieve for a person who isn't really dead?  It's heartless!  Finally, I have the book Trace.  Have I read it?  No.  It was a gift for my birthday and eventually I will probably read it, out of little more than morbid curiosity about how these characters will be forever tainted this time.  I got through about ten pages of Trace and haven't picked it up again in 6 months, opting instead for Wendy Corsi Staub.  Overall, if you're a fan of the Scarpetta novels, don't read this book.  It will change the way you look at the entire series.  I will be content with the older books and try to block out this black mark on an otherwise fabulous author 
 Whoever was responsible for proofreading this book should be sentenced to house arrest. It's hard to believe this defective product was released by the Oxford Press. The frequent grammar and spelling mistakes naturally lead the reader to question whether the facts of the story have been thrown together with the same careless abandon. As far as the story goes, you already know it. Profits, Politics, Power, and Greed combined to facilitate the proliferation of nuclear technology, especially centrifuge technology and chinese bomb design, to Iran, Libya, North Korea, and, of course, Pakistan. No need to spend your money on this book. The Publisher certainly has not earned your business with the release of this shoddy, unprofessional work. 
 Pages and pages of descriptions of trees, fields, sun, clouds, etc.  I have read 100's of books about World War II and was thoroughly disappointed in this book.  I would not recommend to anyone 
 I just don't understand the fuss, and I usually like "dark" stories and writers. Maybe I should read more Moore, but I just couldn't get into "Birds. 
 Ahhhh, what a great movie.  I cry at the end every time.  I remember when I was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of Apollo 13.  However, I am SEVERELY dissappointed with the widescreen DVD.  Those who created it did not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen VHS version.  There are many instances when this is evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says, "I want to go back there".  When the scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below his knees. On the fullscreen VHS you can see his shoes.  When I buy the widescreen, I want the WHOLE movie, not less than the fullscreen VHS tape.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Buy the VHS 
 I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection ("Trouble is My Business") at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago.  The copy I have is thick with 12 stories.  I bought this copy of "Trouble is my Business" to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories.  My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four?  That's not jake, fellas 
 The pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design.  It does not go with the center design.  I think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look.  Pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either.  
 For better or worse, after the relative box-office slump of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, producers Brocolli and Saltzman decided to woo Sean Connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum.  Connery, who had said he would never do another Bond film, donated all of his money to his own foundation.  While his performance is competent and smooth as ever, he seems all business.  No longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant, Connery mechanically works his way through DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, an outright bore of the Bond series and, in my opinion, one of the worst (certainly Connery's worst).  While some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the Bond genre, it plainly isn't.  It was an attempt to return Bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers.  Far from trying to lampoon the Bond formula, the producers were trying to resuscitate it.  And they failed.    After the opening "gun barrel" sequence, we quickly find Bond on a personal mission to kill Blofeld once and for all after the death of Bond's only true wife (discounting the false marriage in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.  (At least, this is what we must assume, since no mention of the marriage is made in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER).  Bond catches Blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and, after a couple of struggles with both Blofeld and a duplicate, Bond drowns Blofeld in a vat of mud.  It is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence.  The titles involves various diamonds, slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women, all set to the title song sung by Shirley Bassey (who also sang the GOLDFINGER title).    The plot of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is quite strange.  In an opening similar to GOLDFINGER, we learn that large quantities of South African diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet, surprisingly, have not made their way to the market.  Worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market, Bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation, disguised as Peter Franks.  Bond quickly succeeds, meeting up with Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of Bond's identity.  Bond's mission is almost compromised from the start when the real Peter Franks makes an entrance, forcing Bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  After a smuggling attempt goes awry (thanks to Bond), Bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating.  It turns out that Blofeld is behind it all (Bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser)!  Blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on Earth.  Blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world, and using Whyte's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser.  Blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in America, Russia, and China.  The purpose?  Blofeld is organizing an international auction, offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder!  Will Bond be able to stop him in time?    DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER feels like a film that was stitched together, rather poorly, from a myriad of interesting elements.  One feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order.  The infiltration of a smuggling ring, the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator, the quirky and gay hitmen Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith), a not-so-subtle rendition of the famous Las Vegas recluse Howard Hughes, a fight on an oil rig, et cetera.  All of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right, but the combination doesn't yield what the producers were hoping for.  What is it about this film that feels so ridiculous?  One of the major problems, in my opinion, is situating Bond in Las Vegas.  Bond in America is dull.  His class, wit, and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  Bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations--not to a strip club.  Furthermore, the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series.  I think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which Bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd.  The chase is boring, the buggy looks ridiculous and prop-esque, and there is no suspense.  The climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring.  Sure, we have a big set and big explosions.  But there is no cutting edge stuff here.   Connery, as mentioned, looks very tired here.  Tiffany Case is a bit refreshing, but quickly becomes dim-witted and dull.  And the Bond girl with the clever name, Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) is only in the film for all of five minutes.  Blofeld is now played by Charles Gray, who first made his appearance as Bond's Japan contact in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.  Gray's performance takes Blofeld back to the ridiculousness of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, even appearing in drag at one point.   There isn't much more to say.  The acting is dead in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.    Now, some have tried to defend DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the Bond genre.  After producing six Bond films, the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move Bond into the Roger Moore pun-fest the series would eventually become.  While this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film, it seems plainly false.  If you watch the "Making of" documentary on the Ultimate Edition, it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real Bond flick and not a parody.  The producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box-office success.  They were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the Bond formula.  Anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization.  This film stinks.  Let's get over it.    Ultimately, I think you should skip DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.  The only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order.  It is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between Sean Connery and Roger Moore.  The Ultimate Edition does have crisp picture and sound.  If you must struggle through the film, make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable.  But if you only desire to watch the better Bond films, skip it.  Diamonds may be forever, but this film died a long time ago.   
 I read Exile all in the space of a 24-hour train ride from NYC to Chicago (via DC) on New Year's Day, and was left thoroughly unsatisfied and bored by it.  While Mark's wanderings from the East Village to Portland were sort  of familiar to me, and his less-than-heroic sexual escapades seemed  honestly told, there is little sense of perspective or meaning in the  novel.  The novel documents the minutia of the day-to-day life of a writer  of bad poetry, his sexual indiscretions and the people who he purposely and  inadvertantly hurts along his path.  It was like reading journal entries  which document a particularly uninteresting period of someone's life.   Really annoying, also, was the tacked-on now-he'll-see-the-light ending,  which took all of ten or fifteen pages and brought absolutely no closure to  the plot.  A lot of books like this have popped up recently; novels that  don't seem to have much to say or much of a plot, but which kind of string  you along with the promise that there could be something underneath all the  meandering jive; finally when you finish, you feel stupid for having wasted  all that time on characters you don't care about and a plot that has taken  you nowhere 
 Teri Hatcher is one of my favorite actresses. I think she is honest, and charming. But this book reveals too much about her insecurities and inadequacies at age 40. It has funny life stories mixed in, but the rest is just an account of how inadqeuate she feels and has always felt. Its sad. I think those thoughts would be better shared with a therapist. 
 It's quite interesting in that is shows what makes the people of this nation tick, by looking at their traditions and examining their ideologies. It addresses the breakdown of traditional communities and human interactions. But the conclusions this book comes to should be quite horrifying to any RATIONAL Joe. The tone of the book is that we are all social animals that live, interact.... and work together in a community based on responsibility to care for others. It is true that we are social animals and that recently people have grown cold to each other...but the solution is not to enslave people with some "inherent responsibility" to others. The book's states that we will only become "human by accepting our essential poverty as a GIFT, and to share our material wealth with those in need."......this is the most anti-American book I've read which tries to fix the social climate in the most horrifying ways. This is SOCIALISM disguised as a Traditional American Way of Life 
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 Forbes is a great magazine.  Amazon on the other hand, well they ought to get out of the magazine business.  Order said first issue would be in February.  Amazon "forgot", to place the order until I called in April to find out what happened.  Now they claim the first issue will be June 19.  Yeah right.  Funny how they don't forget to charge the credit card you place the order.  Don't order magazines from Amazon 
 The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.) It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm.  The weighted base does keep it from falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device.  If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and the nut that holds it together would fall off.  The nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device.  The knob actually turns the nut onto the screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision.  If the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it.  My advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if possible, try the device out before buying. 
 After spending too much money, not only you end up with 4 rows of tabs which make it hard to find anything but some of the chapter and tables are missing 
 It boils down to quitting your addiction, cold. And it's hard, really really hard. Personnaly speaking, I'm addicted to alcohol and cigarrettes. Lucky me, it's the "usual" ones. Without reading this book, yeah I'm being totally honest, just on the face of it, this book is BOGUS. If you're anywhere near a library, (thank you Carnegie!) check this guy out, for free. You'll "get it" real fast 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 I have every single album that Weird Al has ever made.  And I am not impressed by this one at all.  It lacks variety, and is overall boring and not creative.  I enjoy white and nerdy and weasel stomping day, but Close But No Cigar and Trapped In The Drive-Thru (waaay too long) are just crappy.  And Pancreas?  WTF? 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 I bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er Superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much. They just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the Superbowls and just highlights of the game itself. There is special features of some players like Young and Rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on ESPN years ago. Nothing new is on here just old NFL Films shows that they made for ESPN. Very disappointed. They most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game. Terrible 
 This is going to sound like an exaggeration...but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I will admit that I didn't have high hopes for this film.  I mean, it didn't come out in theaters (at least in the U.S.), which is never a good sign, no movie store seems to have it in stock, and I read some pretty crippling reviews right here on good ol' Amazon.  But hey, I gave it a shot.  Boy, was that a mistake...  First of all, here's a quick synopsis: Years ago, King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard) killed a troll, but took pity on the troll's son, Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson), and left him alone.  Grendel, now full-grown, is seeking revenge on Hrothgar's kingdom.  Hearing of Hrothgar's plight, the fierce warrior Beowulf (Gerard Butler) comes to help the king kill Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf meets a witch/prostitute named Selma (Sarah Polley) and discovers that trolls have feelings too.  Now, we all know that Stellan Skarsgard and Gerard Butler are great actors, but in this movie they fumble with a halting and painfully corny script.  The script affects the acting, and the acting affects the film.  Secondly, though Sarah Polley is a lovely actress, she seems very misplaced in this film.  She's the ONLY character with an American accent and, in an age-old Anglo-Saxon myth, this is very, very out of place.  In addition, the small amount of weight that Gerard Butler has put on around the stomach area draws a little from his role as an unstoppable, highly-trained warrior.  The battle scenes are unnecessarily gory, with fake-looking and very blood-soaked limbs flying left and right.  They seem primitive compared to the battle scenes of other films.  The scene in which Beowulf fights Grendel's mother is especially bad - there's lots of shrieking and strobe-light-esque movements that seem almost comical in this day and age.  The only things that can be said in this movie's defense are that the sweeping Iceland landscapes are breathtaking and the Celtic monk (Eddie Marsan) is mildly-amusing in his efforts to convert everyone.  1-star...please don't waste 103 minutes of your life on this film 
 I have the domestic release of this cd-  But it does not contain Hiding Under Water or Lay Your Hands On Me-  So I found the import that I bought through DVD LEGACY-  THE WORST SELLER!  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER-  THEY SUCK!  AND THE CD OF COURSE DID NOT HAVE EITHER OF THE TRACKS ON IT- SOOOO THE QUESTION IS WHERE ARE THEY?  HAS ANYONE FOUND THE LIVE RECORDING OF THESE SONGS ON A CD 
 I'm sorry, Mr. Swierczynski, but, much as I love beer, I fund your book both superficial and a sophomoric.    Maybe it's because I worked in the industry, briefly, back in the 70's when the big breweries were gobbling each other up and decimating the ranks of the regionals.  Beer is a fascinating subject, because it has been so ubiquitous over the years and because it has taken so many shapes and forms.  The book only whetted my appetite for more information in so many areas and then didn't provide it.  The title, "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know . . ." promised more, then didn't deliver. Perhaps if you promoted it as an introductory work, the reader would expect less.  The sophomoric part of my evaluation primarily refers to your constant commentary about "getting hammered" or otherwise over-indulging.  We've all done it, of course, but a true beer lover doesn't drink it to get drunk.  The whole thing makes you sound like a frat rat rather than an adult.  You are right about one thing -- it's the greatest beverage in the world, and has been for a long time. 
 I am so mad at Disney and their movie "Hercules" because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories. I like Greek Mythology, but the movies have not been good at all. And this weak effort is not going to do anything about it. The plot has been changed completly, Pegasus is never mentioned in the real version, He is not trying to impress people, he had no trainer, the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned, the hydra fight is because of a different reason, ugly characters, Hercules was never in love with a chick, Hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either, and all kinds of things that I won't mention.   Don't buy this movie because it is completly different, why don't you read Greek mythology instead of watching this 
 How many remakes of the "Chanukah Song" do we have to endure!  I never liked the song in the first place simply because it really isn't funny. I only saw the movie because it was so overly promoted that I anticipated it would be something great, which it was not.  Were the producers in a hurry to get this out for Chanukah?  The Christophopic overtones is outragious and it simply was not funny 
 The book offers no rigor in any sense and the author seems to have simply copied a large number of formulas from a real probability book. Explanations are sparse and incoherent with vague references to "important applications" with no sense of the abstract concept and virtually no insight into any of the information presented; as another reviewer wrote it is quite dry, I can't see Ben Stein narrating it, but I can picture the author sitting at his keyboard haphazardly plunking in text from other 'sources' all the while wondering what it means.  Skip this and get something with more substance, Peebles offers nothing more than you could find on wikipedia, perhaps less 
 A year or so ago I bought a bunch of self-help books blindly online, with the hope they would represent their titles and be of some use to me personally.  Of them, this is the weirdest. It consists of numerous chapters that are only one or two pages long each! That alone is a very strange format, but the content tends to be very uninformative and strange. I'm definitely of the opinion that self-help theories should be elaborated on, that's why one buys a self-help book, isn't it? But the author rambles, introduces new buzzwords at will, and there is none of the sort of elaboration or system here someone who is looking for help would want. Save your money and look for leading recommended books for your problems 
 This book should really have been split into two different works.  The first book would have been about raising a son (Ned Palmer) with Down syndrome as he transitioned into manhood.  The second book would have been made up of the vocation and philosophical leanings of both author and father, Greg Palmer.  The parts of the book that deal with the author's son are honest and well written.  I too have a son with Down syndrome who is younger than Ned.  Thus, I wanted to learn what might be coming for us in the next several years.  Ned's coming-of-age story was one that seemed honest and hopeful.  There can be no doubt that Greg Palmer loves his son, and has gone to great lengths to provide for him and his future.  The sections about this were helpful.  The unexpected parts of the book were the constant injections it received with Palmer's feelings about politics, religion, art, etc.  While the author did have to reveal some of his personal story to tell his son's; it seemed that the main emphasis of the book was nearly hijacked by Palmer wanting to get in as many jabs as he could against any and everything with which he doesn't agree.  By doing so, the book became polarizing.  Palmer seems to pull to the left about as far as I do to the right.  So, if readers consider themselves liberal to moderate they will most likely enjoy the book all the while nodding in agreement with the author's personal views.  However, if readers are moderate to conservative (like myself), they may wonder why a book about Down syndrome is throwing darts at many other areas of life.  Palmer proceeds to give liberal views on the following subjects and more:  religion, separation of church and state, art, socialized medicine, evolution, stem cell research, the war in Iraq, etc.  He goes on to associate membership in the Bill O'Reilly Fan Club or the NRA as akin to being in the Klan or the American Nazi Party.  The author also seems to have hostility towards any organized religion that requires more than a sideline faith with buffet-style theology.  As a Christian, I found it particularly odd when Palmer basically conveys that he wouldn't mind his son becoming a devout Christian as long as he wasn't too devout.  Also, for those who care, the book has its share of profanity to include taking God's name in vain on numerous occasions.  Again, for some readers these points will carry no weight, but to others they should serve as fair warning.  Finally, Palmer dives far too deeply into discussing his own work in both the theater and at PBS.  This was painful reading to be sure, and it was made all the more painful because so little of it really needed to be said to share the story of his son.  If the book had stuck to the main subject, I could have recommended it.  As it is however, I must advise readers to find one of the many other well-written books about parenting a child with Down syndrome. 
 I should have read the reviews before I bought!  The table was warped right out of the box and you can't make the tabletop level.  Where the notches are won't make it level, it's either too high or too low. It is flimsy, wobbles a lot and not sturdy at all. We purchased at the same time another table called Table Max. This is much better!  It has five level adjustments instead of the three Tablemate has.  It is much sturdier, too.  Buy Table Max instead! 
 This is a good book if you want to see Newfoundland dogs dressed up like grannies and clowns, it is NOT magestic dogs out in a natural environment!  Just a heads up 
 Despite the claims of the afterword, this is NOT one complete novel, but rather two separate novellas - neither of which is particularly good. While Dick is capable of some truly fantastic writing, this is easily his worst and least coherent effort. Supposedly this is a story about a mysterious Eden planet to which emigration was encouraged by the government. However, teleportation to this planet is one-way only and no one ever comes back. Our hero decides to make the journey the hard way (18 years in hyperspace) in order to see if anyone wants to come back. This may have been an original meme back when Dick first wrote it, but it's nothing particularly interesting now. The story is also horribly dated by Dick's heavy-handed use of Jewish characters, neo-Nazi Germans and concentration camp imagery. Yes Phil, the emigrants are just like those Jews walking into the showers in Auschwitz - we get it already! The novella finally concludes with an unclear, off-screen and unsatisfying battle that continues to rage with WWII-esque overtones as the minor characters decide to enlist. Yawn.  This would be a big enough waste of time for all but fanatical PKD afficianados, but it's made even worse by the attempt to cram an almost completely unrelated novella into the middle of it. With no transition or explanation, the reader suddenly finds that the character's names have changed, the plot is completely different and nothing makes much sense. A combination of PKD's most incoherent stream-of-thought prose, an ill-considered plot involving multiple levels of reality and a character in the middle of an LSD trip adds up to page after page of nearly incomprehensible gibberish. If you've the intestinal fortitude to wade through all the badly-dated psychedelia, then you'll end up finding the aforementioned corny ending to the first novella. Someone badly needed to shoot the editor here. If, as claimed in the afterword, this was what PKD actually wanted the novel to look like then he must have been tripping on LSD when he rammed these novellas together. Avoid this like the plague unless you're a rabid PKD fan or unless you really enjoy head-trip psychedelic SF from the 60's. 
 There are gaps above and below in the box which limit the capacity to 22 total individual CDs.  If you have 4 double CD carriers, then you can maximize the capacity to 30.  Otherwise, it looks silly.  I was rather disappointed especially because for a dollar more I could have had a different 30 CD storage cube which I liked better 
 	Linda Lawrence Hunt must have had a time machine.  She chronicles Helga and Clara Estby's 1896 walk from Washington State to New York City in her 336 page book Bold Spirit.  She did so, even though all were unavailable to her.  Helga Estby, a Norwegian immigrant, keep many detailed journals during and after her journey, but her family burned them out of spite and shame.  Helga Estby walked across America to receive $10,000.  She planned to use it to pay off the debts she and her husband Ole and their ten children had accumulated.  Or so says Linda Lawrence Hunt.   	Bold Spirit is ten percent fact and ninety percent speculation.  Gleaning from only a few newspaper articles, public records, and a few interviews, Hunt manages to produce a considerably long piece of what she calls non-fiction.  For all we know, Estby planned to use the money to open up an opium den.  Just because the Estby's were struggling financially and Helga was offered $10,000 doesn't mean she planned to use the money to pay off debts.  Sometimes people do things that don't make sense.   	Hunt's "primary sources" are questionable.  Biased and inaccurate press is as much of an American tradition as hot dogs and beer, and it was especially rampant in Victorian America, as literacy rates and newspaper production rates were increasing but rules about unbiased media hadn't been established.  While periodicals help supplement a biographical account, they should not be the foundation of it.  Because time makes memories fade, interviews of family and friends are just as inaccurate. 	Hunt assumes the political views of Estby and her daughter.  She assumes that Helga was a feminist.  Had Helga been as strong of a woman as Hunt portrays, perhaps she would have written a book about her walk, like she had planned.  Perhaps she wouldn't have taken her nineteen-year-old daughter with her on the 3,500-mile walk.  Perhaps she would have opened up a school or started speaking to the community about her walk.  Estby becomes incredibly apathetic after the walk; perhaps she was depressed because of the death of two of her children while she was away.  Perhaps because she and Ole were never able to fix their relationship after she was away for so long.  Perhaps it was because she was raped or hurt on the trip.  No one knows, not even Linda Lawrence Hunt.  This kind of speculative "non-fiction" should not become a precedent in the historical world. 	This book would have been enjoyable if it were historical fiction.  Hunt could have used her imagination as much as she wanted to do pretty much what she did in Bold Spirit: fill in the gaps left by the documents.  She could have spruced up the story and added plot twists.  Her writing style is insultingly simplistic. 	I would recommend this book to a fifth grader.  The writing style is easy enough to understand.  The plot is basic.  On the surface, it is an encouraging tale about a bold, courageous woman.  But anyone interested in historical integrity, an interesting story, or reading anything past a fourth grade reading level should probably stay far far away from Bold Spirit 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 This is a competent, fun dvd. However, it focuses mostly on choreography at the expense of sweat. Let's put it this way: I'm a semi-regular exerciser, but I'm also fat - and I barely breathed hard. It's a fun workout if you just want to get your [...] off the couch and do something for a half hour, but not so great for a serious cardio workout 
 I thought this book would be more autobiographical and less of his personal opinions about life.   I got bored after only a few chapters and skimmed the 2nd half of the book.  Unfortunately, SP is not a good writer and it SHOWS.  The book skips from one time period to the next and back again without much rhyme or reason to it.  I am a big fan of his acting and this was a real disappointment.   Don't bother with this one.  
 Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre.  When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened.  When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions.  When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming.    In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed.   Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying.  My question to Mr. Patterson is:  If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first ï¿½ of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end?  Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)?  I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters.  Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel.   My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense.  For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows.  Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing.  This is ridiculous.  Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find.  How else do people buy drugs from them?  It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames.    Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal.  It doesn't make sense.  Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality.  Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid. 
                The major problem with this book is Shiller's basic misconception of what the major problem is concerning decision making about the future ,given the incomplete amount of relevant information available in the past and the present,based on what D.Ellsberg called ambiguous probabilities,  J M Keynes called probabilities with low weight(uncertainty),and Benoit Mandelbrot called wild risk(as opposed to the mild risk of the normal probability distribution).Shiller bases his understanding on the "new"behavioral economics associated with the work of Tversky,Kahneman,Thaler,etc.This kind of approach emphasizes not the major problems of ambiguity,uncertainty,or wild risk of Ellsberg,Keynes,and Mandelbrot,but relatively mild problems associated with the Allais Paradox(certainty,reflection,translation,and preference reversal effects plus other assorted anomalies).The problem is that the Tversky-Kahneman approach ,and other associated approaches allied with them, are based fundamentally on the view that the normal distribution is the  correct  distribution to use for educated,rational decision makers.The problem ,then,is that decision makers in general are not rational;they are irrational and uneducated decision makers ,who allow their emotions,combined with their hopes and fears,to influence their decision making .All the anomalous behavior can be traced to the basic irrationality and ignorance of decision makers,who supposedly resort to all kinds of heuristic shortcuts because they have not mastered the fields of statistics and probability correctly.The position of Ellsberg,Keynes,and Mandelbrot is completely different.The decision maker is rational,but must "rely" on probabilities that he knows are unreliable,vague,ambiguous,unclear,and uncertain.In such a world the attempt to gain additional information,as in the stock market,leads to herd,crowd,and cascade effects as each individual decision maker attempts to obtain a little, additional amount of relevant information from other sources that he feels are better informed.Thus,it is the ambiguity or uncertainty of the future that leads to the creation of bubbles,manias,panics,and crashes.These events have little to do with the Tversky-Kahneman approach.The normal probability distribution is completely worthless as a guide to action in the stock market and other financial markets in the face of ambiguity ,uncertainty,or wild risk.In his preface(pp.ix-x),Shiller claims that"...economic thinkers have been limited by the state of relevant risk management principles of their day".Shiller claims that Keynes did not have command of such risk management ideas.The fact is that Keynes,Ellsberg,and Mandelbrot have forgotten more about these ideas than Shiller will ever know.All seven of Shiller's new types of markets and new types of insurance totally ignore the fundamental problem of ambiguity/uncertainty.They are put forth in the misbelief that the kind of decision making problems examined by Tversky-Kanheman are the main explanation for the boom-bust nature of financial markets , the volatility that results,and the unstable nature of such markets  in a capitalist system.Shiller needs to completely rewrite this book and base it on a foundation of Keynes,Ellsberg,and Mandelbrot 
 Please do your self a favor and avoid this series like the plague.  When I start a series, and I've been inthis genre for years, I finsih it.  This is the first one I really wanted to quit.  I really beieive the author fills the books with mindless babble just to fill 800 pages and sell something.  Book 10 is the worst of a really bad series.  Read the dictionary, it has more life 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I found the  Betty Crocker cookbook for kids was limited in actual recipes. I had thought of it for my 11yr old granddaughter but when I received it I was very disappointed in fact I returned it because even for my 7 year old grandson it was too basic. The recipes were things they already cooked. Way too much reading and too little recipes. Not a great job from Betty Crocker 
 I am reading the book "The Westing Game" and I say that this book absolutely awful.  The book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and I never like this before. The characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as "Crow", "Turtle', and "Uncle Sam". The scenery is bad, and I could imagine better places. The ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. I would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again.  The book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. I think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. I don't now how, but Newbery Award. I would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how I really think of this book. My summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed.  
 Perhaps Malkin would know better than to write a completely idiotic book that disgracefully bashes liberals while doing nothing to prove that conservatives are any better because they aren't. All fault finding and no solutions. If Malkin really was a conservative, she wouldn't have shown her intolerance to others.   THE DEATH OF CONSERVATISM  The Destruction By The Neo-Cons Of All That Was Held Dear By Conservatives Has A Growing Number Joining The Ranks Of Independents  by Samuel A Stanson  [... 
 Beware!  Amazon lists this CD, with others, as a choice for a search for Starker on DVD 
 I bought this book so it would provide me with domain-specific pieces of usability knowledge, but it failed at that. Althought there are concrete examples, there's nothing learn from them, as the explanations are so general they almost seem canned. It just takes basic usability concepts and applies them to popular domains, without going into any depth. And you don't need another book for that. The writing style often feels like a desperate attempt to beef up the volume. This isn't a useless book for an absolute beginner, but Steve Krug's "Don't Make Think" is several times thinner, and will teach you just as much, if not more 
 I admire Dr. Virtue and her Healing with the Angel cards are absolutely incredible.  But when I purchased this tape, I expected something a little more educational.    The message I took from this is that if you pray and visualize, your negative karma can be taken away.  It seems like the meditation just focuses on and repeats that message, which I found overly simplistic.    The tape is ok for neophytes -- but if you're looking for something with a little more meat, try some of her other materials.  Even for neophytes, I would highly recommend Marianne Williamson's Return to Love tape over this one.   
 This book is a great stepping stone for understanding.  But considering the Occam's Razor Theory; "the simplest explanation is the best"  I feel simply that understanding Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs is a better source to understanding your childrens needs, or anyones for that matter.  Being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others.  By clearly understanding the role we are in, knowing what actions to be successful to DO, and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children, then we will automatically cover any areas of possible "temperement hinderings" in others.  To achieve the above, I reccommend the Bible.  The book by Hal Urban, available here at Amazon.com titled Lifes greatest lessons.  20 Things That Matter (to know the 8 things that sucessful people do).  And refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called "A Family". Confucius stated; "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home"  I say...Duh!! 
 Did not enjoy the book format of the book. Why? It tries to achieve too much. Combining Self-help Content on Pop Finance, and a Novel inside on Wealth Hunting.  The point sizes of the words inside the book are terribly small (paperback!). I found the reading experience filled with ideas jumping around.  Read " Learn to Earn" is much much better 
 After reading His Dark Materials, The White Mercedes and The Broken Bridge and enjoying them quite throughly, I ventured forth into the deep unknown of "Ruby in the Smoke", expecting something equally well written, insightful, and entertaining... what I found was below par to my standards.  First of all, the character development was practically non-existant, I put down this book feeling that I didn't really know any of the characters at all. Sally Lockhart is your average every day Mary-Sue; uncommonly pretty, quiet, strong, independent, and as flawless as the Ruby that she is destined to find. The emotions displayed at the death of her father are bland and un-grounded, and it's hard to believe that she has emotions at all at certain points of the story. There are hints of romance that never follow through, statements that are never really explained, and mystery that is...kind of unintriguing.   Setting aside the flatness of the characters (Jim was the only one that I think I liked at all, simply because he had some flicker of a personality) there are many things that just don't go smoothly in my mind with this novel. A girl wandering alone in England in the 19th century for one--although she is rumored to be independent, there really is no way that she could have been -that- independent, given the context. Her strength is too faltering to really give credibility to the fact that she wanders the streets alone in her free time in an era where those sorts of actions were not even tolerated.   Furthermore, the plot is too formulatic. It follows the Hero Motif to the T, with absolutely no bells and whistles. The heroine is perfect, the companions are as following: the charming one, the mischevious boy, the fiery maiden, the kindly old man, Ms. Scarlet with the candlestick... ok, well you get the picture. The villian is flat, cookie-cutter evil, without the dimentions that Pullman gave to his Mrs. Coultier in His Dark Materials. It's an ugly old woman that wants to kill little girls for fame and fortune. I know that this book was meant to be a cliche--but there could have been a little bit of development thrown in to make it, well, more fun.   The action is a little under-described to make anything truly interesting. It's a bit of tell-not-show writing with a dryness that doesn't go down well enough, and an ending that leaves you thinking "is that really it?" Who knows, perhaps the other books in the series are more engaging than this one--but the way "Ruby in the Smoke" reads, theres really nothing encouraging me to go on with the series.  Overhyped? Yes. Make room on the shelves for a better mystery--this is something that reads better if you don't have to pay for it, I'm sure 
 Wonderful example of how undisciplined, muddled thinking can create unsound arguments, based on invalid premises, that yield conclusions that will confirm one's biases.  Perhaps in a follow-up book, the author will "prove" that the world is flat.  An early mistake:   She declares that it is (mostly) false that stockholders fund major public corporations, noting that shares trade in secondary markets.  Accordingly, she draws the conclusion that there is no reason that corporations should maximize the interests of stockholders and minimize the interests of shareholders, and that it would be just as appropriate to put the interests of employees first.  In fact, clear economic thinking reveals that successful corporations do make the interests of employees a high priority, because a corporation with unhappy employees has difficulty retaining employees, which makes for an unsuccessful company.  Further, when a corporation raises capital, it often does so by means of a public offering of securities, which is really an agreement between the corporation and the stockholders where the stockholders give the corporation money in exchange for the right to an ownership interest in the corporation.  Whether the shares stay in the hands of the original purchaser or whether the purchaser sells them in secondary markets is not germain; whoever holds the shares holds the right to the ownership interest, which may yield value through appreciation, sale or dividends.  If you think her argument that it would be equally appropriate for a corporation to maximize payments to employees and minimize the interests of stockholders, just try this little exercise:  Form a coproration and attempt to raise capital to run the corporation (including to pay employees).  Then tell the potential investors of your plan to minimize value to stockholders.  Then count how many of these potential investors actually invest their money in your corporation.  (Hint:  if you guessed more than zero, you're too high. 
 My infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds.  It is not a well designed blanket 
 I'm completing an independent study on entertainment law, and more specifically, copyright law and how it pertains to filmmaking. I got this book among several others, and was a little surprised at how poorly written this book is. First off, the editing is TERRIBLE: there are spelling and grammar mistakes ALL OVER the book! On some pages it's outright ridiculous. Honestly, who proofread this before publication?  Second, and most unforigvable, is some of the content. There are some bits of information which are simply WRONG. I haven't taken the time to go through and find them all, but to give an example, it incorrectly states the mandates of a certain copyright act (and I don't mean poorly states, I mean the information is contradictory to what the actual copyright act reads).  So I'm at a bit of a loss I guess. Honestly, I kinda wish I could get my money back. When you get past the bad english, it provides an interesting overview, but then you're always wondering "is this ACTUALLY how this law/fact is? or is this an error?", so you can't really feel like you can rely on it. One error alone was enough to make me question the entire integrity of the book as comprehensive resource.  Summary: might give you some direction on what to read further into, but not too much more than that 
 could have been a truly interesting film, just plain simpleminded and annoying 
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs 
 I wasn't sure if I was reading a new novel, or just re-reading one of several of the last Catherine Coulter novels I've waded through.  I think that I am truly sick of the big, strong man caring for sick, injured woman bit.  The story was dumb; there was no real mystery.  I love the "Song" series and most of the Sherbrooke Brides series.  This was plain disappointing 
 "the nation's failure to offer timely aid to Katrina's victims indicates deeper problems in race and class relations"  The nation only failed to offer timely aid to Katrina' victims because of FEMA's attempts to prevent thousands of volunteers from entering New Orleans to help with evacuation.  "What do politicians sold on the idea of limited governance offer to folk who need, and deserve, the government to come to their aid?"  Considering that it was people sold on the idea of active government who used city-planning and zoning laws to force much of New Orleans below sea level to begin with, I fail to see how the phiolosophy of limited government can be blamed on this to begin with.  "Does George Bush care about black people?"  According to Micael Dyson's logic, he must have since he's a big government "conservative" (anyone who thinks that Republicans and neoconservatives are somewhow any different than Democrats and "liberals" needs a wake-up call.  "that many would be unable to leave because they had no private transportation, yet no means were offered to these urban poor for escape"  Once again, tons of aid and transportation was provided to these people.  FEMA however just wouldn't let these numerous volunteers enter New Orleans to help people out.  "incompetence and antigovernment philosophy, among other factors, made a bad situation even worse."  It wasn't antigovernment philosophy that caused many firefighters to be held up for two days in sexual harassment classes while people were dying.  Michael Dyson is that rare breed of rich, aristocratic fatcat that gains privelidge and prestige from government in order to cover up its f-ups that only cause more pain and suffering to the poor of the world due to statist policies 
 I subscribed to Hobby Farm and after reading two issues I cancelled it.   I read an article in the March/April issue about show birds. Then, I got my May/June issue. Don Schrider, the Communication Director of ALBC, wrote in to correct the story. The article claimed "over 1000" birds at the show, the correction was 11,640 birds were present. The other correction was regarding earlobe color and egg shell color stating there are exceptions to the red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs.    In the Mar/Apr issue I read an article about Guinea hens. In the May/June issue I read another letter from a reader (Dana Manchester a member of the Guinea Fowl Breeders Assoc.) correcting the article in the previous issue. Apparently, Guineas aren't the "watch fowl" they are portrayed to be, but fall victim to predation often. Dana Manchester also corrected the mislabeled photos of Guineas.    These may be small errors but how goods is a resource that isn't reliable?   If errors were the only issues, I may have given the mag 3 stars but the article on manure management in the May/June issue was lacking on many levels. The advise in a nutshell was buy a manure spreader that you can pull around your field, fill'er up and drive. One word of caution according to the article- only use well rotted manure in the garden, but there wasn't one word on how to rot manure.    I liked the article about smaller breeds of cattle, "Bigger is Not Better" May/June but we'll have to wait for the next issue to see if any readers step forward with corrections.   I am not waiting around.   There are a lot books and magazines dedicated to small farms. I like Mother Nature News and I just subscribed to Countryside (my nephew recommended it he owns a small farm, as well). I also like John Seymour's book Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It. He has an upbeat attitude with a can-do spirit. 
 I did not like the book, which is fundamentally flawed from the concept and proposition. Sorry to have wasted my time going through it 
 Lead singer, and founding member of The Lilac Time, Stephen Duffy's greatest claim to near fame may be that he bailed out of the 1980's synth-pop group Duran Duran just before the Durans became mega-stars via MTV. Doggedly pursuing a solo career that yielded a few minor hits in England and Europe, Duffy, by the late `80's, had formed a pop folk quartet called the Lilac Time and they made one brilliant record. And Love for All is not that brilliant record, although there is much to recommend here if you like XTC-style pastoral and dreamy pop music. The production is top notch with XTC's Andy Partridge lending a hand on seven of the twelve songs. Partridges' influence makes many of these songs sound like out-takes from XTC's "Skylarking" or their Dukes of Stratosphere project. The delicate pop tunes that do stick in your head after repeated listens, are also influenced both lyrically and sound-wise by late 1960's Donovan. "All for Love & Love for All" is a great pop tune and the other gem on this record is "It'll End in Tears (I Won't Cry)". Duffy sounds more like Al Stewart or Donovan than John Lennon, which results in a smoother, and gentler folk feel to these songs. Others have called the vocal delivery on this record thin but again, Partridge's production brings Duffy's vocals right up front in the mix, so that the words are clear and they blend nicely with the instrumentation on these catchy melodies. They could have used more guitars (and sitars) rather than the piano introductions to some of the songs. Nevertheless, "& Love for All" is a good record that achieves its' modest goal of carrying on the fine tradition of late-1960's folk-pop.  
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 My 2 year old son loves to "cook" and to serve Mommy and Daddy meals from his kitchen.  My only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor.  It isn't very sturdy, but I'm not unhappy with this purchase 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 I am pro-Neal Schon.  I own many of his solo efforts and every Journey album to date.  However, I honestly can't understand why everyone is rating this album with 5 stars.  It simply does not meet the mark on this one.    None of the tracks have a theme that will 'grab' you.  These aren't songs that will stick in your head.  Saying that this album is 'Neal exploring his melodic side' is pretty inaccurate.  If want to hear Neal's 'melodic side,' by "Beyond the Thunder...." one of his best to date.  These tracks are him basically exploring his improvisational side and jamming to a drum machine.  Even live drum tracks by a great drummer such as Omar Hakim sound as if they are programmed.  I was disappointed on this one.  Neal is an exceptional guitarist....one of the best in the world.  He just didn't hit the mark on this one.  
 Who decided to cast Jessica Alba for this film? For those of you who admire her accent, you're way off! My mother was born in Malaysia, and there's a lot more to the accent than just broken English. Not to mention she looks nothing like the part. Did the casting director say, "Jessica's part-Mexican, ethnic enough -- she can play a Southeast Asian!" JA may be beautiful, but the interchanging is downright insulting, like lumping all the brown people together. Of all the "Asian" women in the trailer, it's so plain to see she's not! Were Asian women not attractive enough for the lead role? Are there not enough of them for a casting call, the most populous race? Actors can only "become" someone different to a degree. After watching the trailer, I was so disgusted I couldn't even give the movie a chance. It would only rile me up. Skip this movie, and ditch all its claims of cultural sensitivity 
 Does not come with the CD as stated.  Emailed the manufacturer and never got a response back 
 As a fan of Mme. Austen, Thomas Hardy, D.H. Lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner, I freely admit to a hopeless addiction to "period" pieces -- and romances, in particular -- and this weakness clearly plays into the VERY generous aforementioned 2-star rating.  "Northanger Abbey" is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon, but PLEASE don't expect this movie to be anything like the big-money Hollywood adaptations of Mme. Austen's other works.  The acting is over-the-top; the soundtrack, deplorable; and the characters (with the exception of Eleanor) are completely unsympathetic.  Catherine is portrayed as an insipid half-wit, rather than a day-dreamy post-adolescent on the verge of womanhood.  Peter Firth's Henry Tilney vascilates between compassionate, brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance.  By the end of the movie, I had lost all patience with them and was convinced that Henry & Catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other.  (This from a romance buff!) Most will give up before the end of the film, but true Austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes, witty repartee, and the opportunity to daydream about the Regency culture.  Watch it or don't -- but if you choose to watch, make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance.  
 I really like Pink Floydm but DO NOT BUY THIS CD. They trim down and butcher songs like MAROONED and ECHOES, and what's the point of Calling it "Echoes" if they cut out 7 minutes of the greatest song of all time? DO NOT BU 
 What Michael Cunningham does best in this book is the little things.  Similes and metaphors and various details are almost always right on.  The story itself, told in alternating first persons, spends most of its time telling us about the characters, especially toward the end.  It seems we have four psychologists who do very little other than analyze themselves and the others.  First, people don't analyze themselves or others nearly to this degree.  Second, the characters actually do very little when not analyzing.  Two other issues are the improbable three-way love affair and Bobby's indefinable sexual orientation.  The worst problem of all is that this is a character-driven novel and I just didn't care about what happed to any of the characters 
 I do not consider myself a conspiracy theorist, just a fact based reality observer.  I would like to ask the author a question though.  For all the conspiracy theorists out there, i'm sure at least SOME of them link Dick Cheney to a group trying to take over the world or whatever.  Tell me this, what are the odds of him being involved with a company that has intentionally fixed (or willed, I think YOU might say) the energy prices in California sky high to make a huge profit and cause widespread recession and economic problems in parts of the state of California, thus causing all sorts of problems for the Governor of California at the time, Gray Davis (whom I despise) which led to a Republican Governor (also implicated in conspiracy theories as he had earlier shown political ambitions in a film made called Demolition Man)...and on and on and on.  I guess you'd call it a conspiracy of coincidence, but not I.  BTW, what is one of the number one crimes committed in the world today?  Do you know?  Conspiracy to committ.  I don't think things are quite as "cut and dry" as you seem to imply in your book sir 
 This book is a smear job against Ayn Rand so that Barbara Branden can clean up her own tarnished reputation while cashing in on Ayn Rand's fame.  James S. Valliant, in his book The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics: The Case Against the Brandens, thoroughly dissects the claims made by the Brandens against Ayn Rand. He then references Ayn Rand's own personal journals to systematically demonstrate how Barbara and Nathaniel Branden deceived and exploited Ayn Rand for years for their own illegitimate aims. Even after Ayn Rand's death, the Brandens continue to cash in on Ayn Rand's self-made fame and her original philosophy of Objectivism. 
 I did not care for the endless repetition with minor variations. I did not care for the one-sidedness of it all--man gets off, maid is out in the cold. I did not care for the endless repetition with minor variations. One  had the feeling someone was trying out a lit'rary exercise and it got  published by mistake. One had no sympathy for any one in the book, and one  felt one was overcharged 
 If you use PPG paint, there's nothing there for you. They make painting sound so complicated that you'll want to take your car to a shop. Constantly mentioning supplied air respirators etc... When have you ever seen a painter in a scuba outfit? I know the fumes aren't good for you, but come on 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.

 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 It pains me to give American Aurora a relatively negative review, as the book was entertaining and well-prepared. I must do so, however, because the book offers only part of the story. James Thomas Callendar is one of the most amusing characters of early American history -- the forefather of folks like Walter Winchell and Matt Drudge, the first American "scandalmonger," as William Safire calls him. But he was motivated by money and personal pique, embracing and denouncing Washington, Adams, and Jefferson in turn to sell papers and whenever he felt one had slighted his ambitions. American Aurora focuses only on the period of the Alien and Sedition Acts and Callendar's campaign against Adams. The book makes Callendar out to be a John Peter Zenger-caliber hero of free expression, ignoring the fact that Callendar once praised Adams, and would later tarnish Jefferson -- Callendar's hero in American Aurora -- and breaking the story of Sally Hemings. This is a fun read. Too bad it's not the whole truth 
 uh......... no this book had litle to be desired and its just not cool with all them big words i mean come on.  Whats a sherry and what is an  amontdillo i dont even know. loserbook. Go Central High Footbal 
 man this album is boring. i saw them live in LA and it was even worse. the lead singer stormed off stage and threw insults to the audience. avoid this band 
 When I got this cd I thought it was the music from the first version and that is the main reason I bought it. Its an ok cd just not my taste in music 
 We got this as a gift & used it.....its loud and spits out water.  We're not happy with it 
 October marks Connie's 50th year as a recording artist and this is what they put out? Another hodge podge of hits that can be found on SO many compilations that have come out of the US. Universal should look to Japan or South Africa--now they have put out tributes befitting the biggest selling female singer of all time. This is a sad (but probably sells) and not very well made 50th Anniversary release. They used mono tracks when stereo were available. Connie Francis is an American, yet overseas she appears to be more respected. Pitiful. Shame on us
